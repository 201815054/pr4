0,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Putin says opposing forces in Belarus need to resolve crisis via talks,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Belarus was facing unprecedented meddling by external forces and he called on opposing political forces to try to resolve their differences through talks.
The country, a close Russian ally, has been rocked by mass protests since an Aug. 9 presidential election which veteran incumbent Alexander Lukashenko said he won - an assertion contested by his opponents, who say the vote was rigged and want him to quit. 
Moscow's backing is seen as vital for Lukashenko's chances of staying in power and its statements are being closely watched for changes in tone or any sign that Moscow could be pushing for some kind of managed power transition. 
""I really hope the Belarusian people have the political maturity to calmly and without any sharp movements build a domestic political dialogue with all political forces and resolve all its internal questions themselves without any kind of external pressure and outside interference,"" Putin told an online meeting of a Russia-led security bloc attended by Lukashenko. 
Russia has ostensibly backed Lukashenko throughout the turmoil, but signs have begun to emerge that it wants him to de-escalate the situation, enter talks with his opponents, and embark on long-promised constitutional reform, a process that could culminate in him stepping down.
Lukashenko has so far spoken of possible change, while stamping out protests with greater force. Most prominent opposition leaders have been jailed or fled. 
Lukashenko has ruled Belarus, a former Soviet republic of 9.5 million that Russia sees as a security buffer against NATO, for 26 years. He has often played Moscow off against the West to extract political and economic dividends from the Kremlin. 
Last week Russia sent its foreign minister to Minsk to tell Lukashenko to press ahead with constitutional reform to defuse the crisis, an initiative Lukashenko himself had promised but which had stalled.
The following day, Lukashenko said he would step down as president once a new constitution is adopted, though he gave no timeline for those moves. 
Protesters dismiss the reform promises as a stalling tactic. 

Speaking at the online Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) meeting on Wednesday, Lukashenko blamed the unrest on outside meddling, singling out Poland and the Baltic states in particular.

The negotiations between the old foes were launched in October, with delegations convening at a U.N. base to try to resolve a dispute about their maritime border that has held up hydrocarbon exploration in the potentially gas-rich area.
But a session scheduled for Wednesday was postponed with U.S. officials instead pursuing separate contact with the sides.
Aoun told visiting U.S. official John Desrocher that Lebanon wanted the talks to succeed to strengthen stability in southern Lebanon and allow for oil and gas investment.
""The difficulties that appeared in the last round of negotiations can be removed through in-depth research based on international law and the articles of the law of the sea,"" Aoun told Desrocher, the presidency said in a statement.
Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Monday it had been agreed with the Americans that talks would be postponed for a few weeks.
The talks are the culmination of three years of diplomacy by Washington.
Disagreement over the sea border has discouraged oil and gas exploration near the disputed line.
The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006, has said the talks are not a sign of peace-making with Israel. The group exercises significant influence in the state and backed the now caretaker government of Hassan Diab.
Israel already pumps gas from huge offshore fields but Lebanon has yet to find commercial gas reserves in its own waters.

The taxes, managed by Israel under interim peace accords from the 1990s and usually handed over monthly, make up more than half of the budget of the Palestinian Authority (PA), whose economy has been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The 3.77 billion shekels ($1.14 billion) transfer is the first since June, when the Palestinians snubbed the handover due to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans, currently suspended, to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. 
The Palestinians also rejected the cash several times in 2019 after Israel trimmed the sum in retaliation for funds going to the families of jailed or killed militants. It usually amounts to about $190 million a month.
""The #Israeli government transfers all financial dues of the clearance to the account of the #Palestinian Authority,"" Palestinian Affairs minister of civil affairs Hussein al-Sheikh tweeted, giving the figure as 3.768 billion shekels.
The Israeli Finance Ministry confirmed the details.
The PA has been unable to pay full wages of its 130,000 employees in the past months. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said this week it would pay full salaries once it received the tax money. 
Israel froze its annexation plans in August as part of an agreement to forge diplomatic ties with the United Arab Emirates. The Palestinians in November said they were resuming civil and security cooperation with Israel suspended over the annexation. The announcement came about two weeks after Biden beat incumbent Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race. 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has since indicated he will drop his three-year political boycott of the White House.
""Right now we are sending clear messages not only to the Israelis, not only to the Biden administration but also to the Europeans and many others that Palestine, and the Palestinians are ready to reengage completely with Israel,"" Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said in a Nov 26 video conference.

Student Salam Kanoush, 29, fled Syria in 2016. He says he was kidnapped and robbed while leaving Aleppo and bombing attacks made it unsafe for him to remain at his university in Damascus.
Kanoush says his mission is to prove that refugees can bring about change and has devoted his free time to helping other refugees and people in need.
""In Sudan I wanted to give an example that refugees are not really problems,"" he told Reuters.
""Now we hear refugees are related to sadness and poor people and they are always in need, but we are not like that, some people can really make a change.""
Volunteering for the Italian aid organisation COOPI, Salam works on purifying water, setting up transport routes and locating water sources to help Ethiopians arriving at the Hamdeyat border reception centre.
Salam has also volunteered in other refugee camps during his time in Sudan and has founded an organisation in Sudan's eastern Kassala state that empowers women and young people to start their own businesses.
A month-long war in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region has sent 45,000 refugees into neighbouring Sudan.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>",Special Report: Iran expands shrines and influence in Iraq,"By John Davison
KERBALA, Iraq (Reuters) - In September, a senior Iranian commander made an unannounced visit to one of Shi'ite Islam's holiest sites in the southern Iraqi city of Kerbala.
Hassan Pelarak, a top officer in the Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, had recently been sanctioned by the U.S. for weapons smuggling. He was checking in on a construction project led by a firm he owns together with other Revolutionary Guards, a foundation linked to Iran's Supreme Leader. This foundation too is under U.S. sanctions.
The vast, $600 million expansion at the Imam Hussein shrine, which is revered as the place of martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, will swell the capacity of what is already the world's largest annual pilgrimage, dwarfing the Hajj to Saudi Arabia's Mecca. It is the biggest development at the shrine in 300 years.
An Iraqi worker at the site sent Reuters pictures of Pelarak, wearing a hard hat and sporting a blue surgical mask, having his temperature taken before entering. The visit, confirmed by an Iraqi employee of the foundation, was not reported by Iranian or Iraqi media. But his visit was not unusual. Pelarak and other Guards commanders overseeing the project freely drop in, workers say, and are given quick tours by the exclusively Iranian companies and engineers they have contracted to carry out the work.
Qassem Soleimani, the late Quds Force commander who spearheaded Iran's military and political strategy across the region, was filmed touring the project in 2018, 18 months before he was killed by a U.S. drone strike. His successor, Esmail Ghaani, made an unannounced visit to the shrine two weeks after Pelarak, said an Iranian source in Kerbala.
Day and night, Iranian labourers fill in a 40-metre deep, 50,000-square-metre crater next to the shrine with steel girders and cement brought from Iran. The multi-storey buildings they are erecting will contain ablution stations, a museum and a library. Millions of predominantly Shi'ite pilgrims from across the Islamic world will access the Hussein shrine via a large road tunnel.
It is one of the largest of the multi-million dollar projects that the Revolutionary Guards-owned Kawthar foundation (Kowsar in Persian) is leading to develop religious tourism in Iraq and Syria – with more in the pipeline.
For this report, Reuters paid five visits to the Kerbala project site, examined public information from the shrines and companies and interviewed at least 20 Iraqi and Iranian workers, engineers, businessmen, religious and political officials. The examination reveals how Iran's close involvement in religious tourism is bringing Tehran soft power and cementing a presence in Iraqi religious centres that are the nexus of Shi'ite regional influence.
Control of shrine development also deepens trade ties and is a target of potential economic opportunity for Iran: Religious tourism is worth billions of dollars a year in Iraq, the second-largest earner of revenue for the country after the oil sector.
""Iran has long penetrated the Iraqi deep state,"" said Bangen Rekani, a former Iraqi housing minister with knowledge of the projects. Increasingly, he said, ""Iranians use their soft power and religious ties, which can be more important than political ties.""
Iraq's government grants religious projects special privileges, including tax exemptions on imports of Iranian cement, steel and other materials. According to multiple sources, many of these goods are brought into Iraq ostensibly for shrine development but are then sold elsewhere in the country. Reuters couldn't determine the extent of this trade, which helps counter Western sanctions on Iran.
The development of Shi'ite shrines is being spearheaded by Iran's Holy Shrines Reconstruction Headquarters, a body set up by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and run by the Revolutionary Guards' appointees. In March, Washington sanctioned the Headquarters and Kawthar, its Iraq-based engineering wing. Pelarak was among officials targeted. The Americans alleged the Headquarters and Kawthar were involved in ""lethal aid"" to proxy militias in Iraq and Syria, intelligence activities and money laundering. A Treasury spokesperson told Reuters that Iran sought to expand its influence and exploit Iraqi financial and business sectors.
Khamenei has condemned U.S. sanctions as an attempt to destroy Iran's economy and overthrow its ruling system. Reuters sought comment for this article from the Iranian government, the Revolutionary Guard, its engineering wing Kawthar and Pelarak, but didn't receive a response. An Iraqi government official said he couldn't comment about Kawthar's activities in Iraq because he didn't have details, a remark echoed by a spokesperson for the Iraqi state body that administers religious sites.
A spokesman for the Hussein shrine, Afdhal al-Shami, told Reuters that Iran's involvement was needed because ""Iraq's economy is such that we can't undertake a project like this on our own.""
""Iranians love the shrines. When this money comes in from Iranian donors, through an official body, that's a psychological boost and good publicity at home and abroad for the Iranian government,"" he said in an interview.
""DOWN TO THE MIRRORS, IT'S ALL IRANIAN""
Iran built power in Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein and brought rule by Iraq's Shi'ite majority, especially parties supported by Tehran. The Revolutionary Guards grew a military-business empire in Iran, then expanded their influence across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. They created a corridor to support militia allies across the region and dominate land borders, overground trade, and expand their presence at Shi'ite holy places.
But now the Islamic Republic's attempts to expand influence in Iraq are facing new challenges. Iran is distracted by the coronavirus pandemic at home and dissent against the political parties and militant groups it backs in Iraq and Lebanon. Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has supported calls for political reform and long opposed foreign interference, including that of Iran. The United States and its allies are trying to roll back Iranian influence with sanctions, assassinations of military commanders and a new alliance between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. For the first time in years, an Iraqi government, led by Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, has sided with the United States. Kadhimi's appointment was opposed by Iran-aligned militia groups.
Pelarak's September visit to Kerbala was the latest sign that despite U.S. pressure on the Revolutionary Guards' activities in Iraq, the Guards press on with Kawthar's work.
The U.S. Treasury's sanctions in March said Kawthar ""served as a base for Iranian intelligence activities in Iraq, including the shipment of weapons and ammunition to Iranian-backed terrorist militia groups."" An Iraqi customs official told Reuters Iran did not need Kawthar, an organisation focused on trade and soft power, to transfer weapons. ""There are other ways of doing that – their proxy militias control the borders from the Kurdish north to the south of Iraq,"" he said.
Kawthar carries out shrine development on behalf of the Holy Shrines Reconstruction Headquarters using a number of specialised Iranian companies. Kawthar is owned by Pelarak and at least two other Guards-linked officials, including a Quds Force commander based in the southern Iraqi holy city of Najaf, according to the U.S. Treasury.
Iraqi traders and officials described how during Iran's economic downturn Kawthar has become more important because of its grip on development of religious sites.
""Iran had its eye on shrines since the fall of the (Iraqi) regime in 2003,"" said Dhiaa al-Asadi, a former lawmaker close to Najaf-born Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.
The Hussein shrine, visited by up to 50 million pilgrims each year, is housed within a vast, golden-domed mosque decorated with ornate entrances, wooden gates and glass – all from Iran, according to former Iraqi housing minister Rekani and several other government sources. ""Down to the mirrors in the shrines, it's all Iranian,"" Rekani said.
The faithful eat for free in adjoined dining halls and pray on carpets while drilling and other sounds of upkeep punctuate an otherwise quiet reverence.
A Reuters reporter visited a Kerbala hotel leased out by the Hussein shrine to host engineers working on the project. The hotel lies on a secured street monitored by cameras. In the reception, a calligraphic sign commemorates the assassinated Soleimani. Engineers dropped by reception on their break to collect packed lunches of rice, chicken and barberries, typical Persian fare. Iranian workers occupy two more hotels in the city and temporary cabins next to Kawthar's nondescript offices, which overlook the shrine expansion project.
There, Iranian workers wearing the overalls of the companies contracted by Kawthar toil next to health and safety signs in Persian. The engineers in hard hats are often graduates of Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, according to an Iraqi contractor working with Kawthar. The university is on Western sanctions lists for alleged involvement in nuclear weapons research. Iran's science minister has said its activities have nothing to do with atomic weapons research.
The construction site, half empty about a year ago, has quickly been filled with the skeletons of buildings. Pelarak signed a nearly $650 million contract in 2015 with the Hussein shrine for Kawthar to build the extension, named the Sahn al-Aqila Zeinab, the Courtyard of Zeinab, Hussein's sister.
The Headquarters lists at least 17 projects it is overseeing at important shrines in Najaf, Kerbala, Baghdad and the northern city of Samarra. These contracts are often years-long and worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
In Najaf, Kawthar and the Headquarters have repaired the Imam Ali shrine's golden dome and facade, and are carrying out a $500 million infrastructure expansion there too. In Baghdad, they have built ornate windows at the shrines of two Shi'ite imams and have been repairing a minaret that is leaning because of swelling groundwater, according to a shrine official. The Headquarters is also working on an expansion of the al-Askari shrine in Samarra. This shrine was bombed by Sunni extremists in 2006, setting off some of Iraq's most violent sectarian bloodshed.
Pelarak is eyeing more work. He told Iranian semi-official news agency Fars in August he hoped to carry out an expansion at another site in Kerbala, the Imam Abbas shrine, part of a plan ""agreed by Iraq's housing ministry"" but not yet requested by the shrine. A spokesman for Iraq's housing ministry said he couldn't comment because, ""there is no accurate information available on this."" The shrine didn't comment.
Several Iranian firms carry out the work, serving as contractors. A tunnel, foundation and water specialist called Abtaban is working on the Kerbala project, according to the Revolutionary Guards-linked Tasnim news agency. Padideh, a civil engineering contractor, and Mana, a construction firm, are involved in both the Kerbala project and the development of the Imam Ali shrine in Najaf, according to Iranian news and company websites. Padideh says on its website it is aiming to increase its work in the region.
Reuters found no link between these companies and the Guards beyond the contracts with Guards-run organisations, and the firms are not under U.S. sanctions. The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
An Iraqi government official said Kawthar's activities and finances are not shared with any Iraqi government departments.
A spokesman for the Iraqi state body that administers Shi'ite religious sites said: ""We can't discuss any topics related to the work of Iranian companies because we do not intervene or have specific details on their activities. They work in holy cities but other than that we don't know anything.""
Shami, the spokesman for the Hussein shrine, said ""if Kawthar has other activities, we don't know about this."" He said he was also unaware of U.S. sanctions against Kawthar.
SPECIAL STATUS
The Iraqi state funds the initial buying up of private and public land at the sites through budget allocations to Shi'ite religious authorities which make the purchase, said Rekani, the former housing minister.
For the Sahn al-Aqila, part of the Kerbala project, religious authorities paid some $170 million to buy at least 300 properties, according to shrine officials. The Hussein and adjacent Abbas shrines plan to take over more land nearby, the officials said.
Mohammed Musawi, who used to live where the Sahn al-Aqila is being built and owned two hotels there, said the demolition of his properties brought a handsome fee but erased his business and a generations-old family property.
""I didn't want to sell the house, but when the shrine decides to expand, there's nothing you can do,"" he said. ""People receive a lot of money to sell, and if they refuse are given a court order.""
The shrine paid Musawi and his six siblings nearly $1 million for their property. He now runs a corner shop and relies heavily on the pilgrimage business.
After land acquisition, shrine projects are then fully funded by Iran – ostensibly from donations by devout Iranian Shi'ites and through charities linked to Shi'ite shrine organisations, officials at the Hussein shrine said. An Iranian employee of Kawthar, who declined to be named, said much of the money came from Iranian state coffers, but he didn't know what proportion. A project costing in excess of $600 million ""can't just come from donations, you need a state behind that,"" he reasoned. Other Iranian and Iraqi sources supported this view.
Shrine projects get special status under Iraqi law, meaning they are overseen by the shrine organisations, not by the state. There are customs exemptions for all materials coming from Iran for religious, donor-funded projects.
An engineering official at the Hussein shrine declined to say how much steel, cement, wood and other imports are brought from Iran for the project. An Iraqi trader who has worked with Kawthar said large quantities of Iranian steel and cement are imported tax-free under the guise of shrine projects, but then sold via middlemen onto the Iraqi market, where prices are higher than in Iran. A senior Iraqi official with direct knowledge said firms involved in shrine projects ""often order several times the required amount"" of building materials.
Shami, the Hussein shrine spokesman, maintained that it would be difficult to siphon off goods in this way because they are inspected by Iranian and Iraqi customs officials then transferred straight to the shrine's warehouses. He didn't rule out the possibility that some imports had forged shrine documentation, however. ""Everything is possible in Iraq,"" he said.
The firms have had their workers bussed in from Iran even when the borders are closed, as during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. One Iranian employee of Kawthar told Reuters that when the borders first closed there were problems getting into Iraq, ""but the Hussein shrine intervened to get exemptions."" He estimated there were around 200 Iranian workers currently, down from 2,000 earlier.
Shami said he didn't know if the shrine had sought travel exemptions for Iranian workers.
The Iraqi customs official and an Iraqi contractor said Kawthar is also involved in other infrastructure projects, including energy. Among these projects, according to the contractor, is a power plant in Basra. The power plant project was led by an Iranian energy company called Mapna, which has also been sanctioned by the United States. Mapna is building power plants in Najaf and Baghdad, as well as one of Kerbala's largest hotels, a Reuters review of official filings found. Mapna didn't respond to a request for comment.
A LONG GAME
Workers in Kerbala say they see evidence that U.S. sanctions are hurting Iran, and Kawthar. The Iranian Kawthar employee told Reuters he used to take home $1,100 a month, paid in the stable Iraqi dinar, but since the sanctions kicked in, he gets only around $200 because he is now paid in the weak Iranian rial. Work on the site for local Iraqis has all but dried up. An unemployed Iraqi engineering graduate, who used to get regular labour at the shrine, told Reuters he now spends his days hoping for work. He struggles to support a young family.
For the Islamic Republic, its involvement in Iraq's Shi'ite shrines is a long game. It brings an enduring presence in Shi'ite centres of power, where Iran hopes to influence the succession of Iraq's most powerful Shi'ite cleric, Sistani. The Guards are regularly in Najaf, where Sistani is based. Sistani's office didn't respond to a request for comment.
Sistani's edicts sent Shi'ite Iraqis to the polls for the first time in their lives in 2005, created an amalgam of Shi'ite paramilitaries to fight Islamic State in 2014, and toppled an Iraqi government last year. Sistani stands against Iranian and other foreign interference in Iraq, and opposes the theocratic model of rule by Khamenei. The Iranian pick to succeed the 90-year-old Sistani died in 2018 in a setback to the Islamic Republic's plans for Iraq.
Though Iranian influence is resented by large sections of Iraq's Shi'ite population, religious ties run deep. At the Hussein shrine, bullet holes from where Saddam's soldiers gunned down Shi'ite rebels in 1991 are framed. At the time, Iran was a haven for Shi'ite opposition to Saddam, a Sunni.
The pilgrimage to commemorate Hussein, slain in battle in 680, is closely associated with the martyrdom of today. Next to images of Hussein on Iraqi highways are posters of Shi'ite militiamen killed fighting Islamic State, which counted Shi'ite Muslims among its most bitter enemies and considered them heretics. Next to them are pictures of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the godfather of those militia groups, killed alongside Soleimani by America.
Abu Mahdi and Soleimani featured this year on a banner at one stall next to the Hussein shrine offering pilgrims free tea and juice, run by Kawthar employees. Just next to the stall were the flags of Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces, the state paramilitary grouping dominated by Iran-aligned fighters. At Baghdad's Kadhimiya shrine, one donation box is for the Forces.
Iran uses its presence to project regional strength to Sunni Muslim rival Saudi Arabia and bolster its legitimacy at home as a defender of Shi'ite holy places, said Iraqi officials and Iran experts. Saudi officials did not comment for this article.
""Iran wants economic, religious and political influence. The best place to do that is Kerbala and Najaf,"" said Mohammed Sahib al-Daraji, a lawmaker on Iraq's finance committee. ""Iran is weakened, but it's stronger than America in Iraq.""
Ordinary Iraqis say they find themselves once more in the middle of the contest between Iran and America. The Iraqi engineering graduate, who looks older than his 30 years and wears a frayed baseball cap, resents that the only work he's ever found in his hometown is run by the Revolutionary Guards. But he also resents that when U.S. sanctions kicked in, that work began to dry up.
He spends most days looking for menial jobs. When he's bored, he borrows for his bus fare and travels to Baghdad with other out-of-work engineers to hold protests demanding jobs and railing against Iraq's ruling elite - and Iran.

""I'm now working a few days here and there on the shrine project, whenever I can get it,"" the worker said. ""They've reduced my pay by half. But I'll work for the Iranians if it puts bread on the table – what else is there?""

Thirty two people were rescued and a search operation was underway with the assistance of two helicopters and a Frontex vessel, the official told Reuters. 
Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees used Greece as the main gateway to Europe through Turkey in 2015 and 2016, until a deal between Ankara and the European Union reduced the flow across the Greek and Turkish land and sea borders.
Sea crossings on overcrowded boats are often hazardous and last month, the Greek coastguard found the body of a migrant near a half-sunken vessel on the Aegean island of Rhodes.
And in September at least three people drowned when a boat carrying migrants sank off the island of Crete.
Turkey hosts more than three million refugees and migrants, while tens of thousands of asylum seekers are still in Greece waiting for their applications to be processed, mostly housed in camps where conditions have been described as dire. 
Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said the EU-Turkey deal was being violated and human lives were being put at risk. 
Citing those rescued, Mitarachi said a Turkish boat had responded to a distress signal but did not provide aid, instead allowing ""an irregular crossing"" through the EU's sea border.
Turkey's coastguard said it had intercepted a vessel carrying migrants in the area on Tuesday and had taken 31 people into custody.
Greece and Turkey are at odds over a host of issues and regularly exchange accusations over the migration crisis.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A young, bespectacled computer graphic artist unknown outside China has found instant notoriety overseas after a computer-generated image of his sparked a row between Beijing and Canberra. 
The widely circulated, digitally manipulated image of an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child was tweeted by a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman on Monday, drawing the fury of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
The number of social media followers of the artist, who calls himself Wuheqilin, has since risen to 1 million, with some hailing the image as a new chapter in Chinese propaganda artwork. 
""Wuheqilin"" in Chinese translates to ""a qilin amid the masses,"" referring to the one-horned mythical beast. 
""The paintbrush of Wuheqilin is more effective than an army,"" said a user on China's Twitter-like microblog Weibo (NASDAQ:WB). 
Wuheqilin also proclaims himself as a ""wolf warrior"" artist, after two popular Chinese movies in which the action hero prevails over evil U.S. mercenaries. The phrase ""wolf warriors"" is also used by international media to characterise China's sometimes combative diplomacy.
Wuheqilin has long supported Chinese propaganda artwork, but it was only last summer when he infused political themes into his images as Hong Kong was rocked by street protests, according to interviews with Chinese media. 
""There're too many cases where comics are used to smear China - from the Hong Kong protests last year to the COVID-19 epidemic at the start of the year and to Western countries passing the buck to China and asking for compensation (over COVID-19), I've seen countless examples,"" Wuheqilin told Guancha.cn, a nationalistic media outlet, in June. 
""One of the responsibilities of artwork and artists is to promote and export ideology... Especially during this special period when the West is using their say to press hard on China.""
His first politically-charged image ""A Pretender God"" (2019) depicts a group of Hong Kong protesters worshipping the Statue of Liberty. Instead of a torch and a tablet, she holds a petrol bomb and a keyboard.
It was unclear if he has any ties with the Chinese government and ruling Communist Party, although he was invited to an event organised by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League during China's national cybersecurity week in September, according to his Weibo. 
Wuheqilin declined to be interviewed by Reuters. 
THRILLED
On social media, Wuheqilin said he was thrilled foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian tweeted his work. 
""Director Zhao, so powerful!! Let's kick some ass! Disarm them for me!!!"" Wuheqilin wrote on Weibo. 
In contrast, he had few kind words for Morrison. 
Morrison has condemned the tweet and demanded an apology from China, whose relations with Australia have worsened after Canberra called for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.
""I'd still advise Mr. Morrison to face reality and put his effort in domestic affairs, like making sure his military becomes more disciplined so that this kind of tragedy does not ever happen again,"" Wuheqilin said in the interview with Guancha. 
Australian troops have fought in the war in Afghanistan since 2001 but there is no indication that Wuheqilin's image depicted any actual event.
Last week, the head of Australia's army said the government had told 13 special forces soldiers they face dismissal in relation to an independent report on alleged unlawful killings in Afghanistan.
Late on Tuesday, Wuheqilin posted another image, titled ""To Morrison"", which shows Morrison holding what could be a flag over dead bodies and pointing at a child standing before a bloody canvas, while a gaggle of photographers turn their cameras toward the young artist.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 05:41AM ET</span>",Middleman matters: Behind Indian protests against Modi farm reforms,"By Krishna N. Das and Mayank Bhardwaj
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Undeterred by the harsh winter of India's capital, its toxic air and surging coronavirus cases, Sukhbinder Singh is among tens of thousands of farmers camped out in protest on the city's outskirts, along with tractors, trailers, SUVs and food trucks.
The farmers say they have enough flour, potatoes and other provisions to stay put for six months if Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not meet their demand: a repeal of new laws that he has described as the biggest farm reforms in the country in decades and trade analysts have hailed as a booster shot for the world food market.
The sea of unmasked people at the heavily barricaded protest site on the main highway into northern Delhi is the biggest challenge Modi has faced from India's politically powerful farmers since he took office six years ago, and is a chink in his otherwise immense personal popularity.
The laws enacted by parliament in September are aimed at linking potential bulk buyers, such as WalMart Inc, Reliance Industries Ltd and Adani Enterprises Ltd, directly with farmers, bypassing government-regulated wholesale markets and layers of commission agents.
But more than 60 rice, wheat and potato growers from the farm states of Punjab and Haryana told Reuters the government was trying to privatise agriculture by eliminating the agents, who are a vital cog of the farm economy and for thousands of farmers, the main line of credit.
The middlemen provide quick funds for seeds and fertilisers, and even for family emergencies, said the farmers. The agents also help grade, weigh, pack and sell harvests to buyers.
While the farmers camped out on the highway are mainly from Haryana and Punjab, they claim to have support from all over the country. The All India Agricultural Workers Union, which claims to represent millions of rural farm hands, has vowed to launch a nationwide blockade this week to support the demands.
The protesters said a move to eliminate middlemen in the eastern state of Bihar had failed to draw new investment and its farmers were worse off as they often had to resort to fire sales in the absence of organised wholesale markets.
""Some landholders from Bihar now work our farms,"" said 45-year-old Sukhbinder Singh, who said he grows wheat, potatoes and mustard in his 20-acre farm in Haryana.
By his side, another farmer made tea next to his tarpaulin-covered trailer stuffed with flour, potatoes, mattresses and blankets.
""This is the time for us to grow winter crops back in the village,"" Singh said. ""But if we don't protest now, our next generation will curse us for not fighting the fight. The agents and us are interdependent.""
'NO TO HITLERISM'
For Punjab's Jasbir Singh, a 45-year-old who said he owns 12 acres of land, the middlemen are a lifeline for his farm and his family.
Without all the documents that banks insist on, and based only on the likely future yield of his crop, he says commission agents have been lending him money every year. Ten years ago, it was for his sister's wedding and this year he took on $5,000 more.
""My son is 21 now, I am sure I will again borrow from them for his marriage,"" Jasbir Singh, a tall man with a grey turban, said as young men played cards nearby and others soaked in the winter sun.
As the sun set on the blockaded stretch of the highway watched over by hundreds of policemen, many in riot gear, a small group of farmers called out Modi's name and shouted: ""Say no to dictatorship, say no to Hitlerism"".
The government is holding talks with the farmers to persuade them to end their protest and see the longer-term benefit of the reforms.
""If the farmer finds a buyer who takes the produce directly from the farm, who manages everything from transport to logistics and gives better prices, should not the farmers get the freedom,"" Modi told a public meeting.
Many economists, including former government adviser Ashok Gulati, say the reforms would bring fresh investments to the sector.
""The new laws are a stepping stone to modernise India's agriculture, but the result will not come immediately,"" Gulati said. ""The government should pro-actively communicate with farmers to explain that this bold step will eventually help them and help Indian agriculture.""
But Devinder Sharma, an independent agricultural expert, said middlemen play a pivotal role in ensuring farmers' welfare.
""There is a symbiotic relationship between the two, and for most farmers, middlemen are like ATMs,"" Sharma said.
The farmers also worry that after initially paying good returns for their produce, corporate buyers could force down prices.
They are upset the government will not commit in writing to continue a decades-old price support policy for staples such as wheat and rice.

""The government thinks the laws are good for farmers, fine, but if the farmers disagree, then scrap them,"" said Paramjit Singh Sarna, a businessman who has been feeding the participants even though his utensil-making factory near the highway is struggling to move its goods because of the blockade.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 05:11AM ET</span>",Signs of dissent within Thai military as protests grow,"By Chayut Setboonsarng and Matthew Tostevin
BANGKOK (Reuters) - In July, as thousands of Thais demanded the resignation of the government in one of the largest street demonstrations since a 2014 military coup, Army Sergeant Ekkachai Wangkaphan sided with the protesters. 
""Down with dictatorship,"" he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) under a news story about a jailed activist, a week before the protest. On the day of the protest, July 18, he shared a livestream and pictures with the hashtag of the Free Youth protest group. A few weeks later, he shared a photo of a protester carrying a placard saying ""The country where you speak the truth and you go to jail.""
His superiors in the Royal Thai Army warned him to stop. But he had already made up his mind to quit and left the army in October. 
""When the protests escalated, orders to prohibit social media posts came in more often,"" Ekkachai, 33, told Reuters in an interview. ""They want to nip it in the bud, but they can't.”
Social media is exposing discontent among some soldiers, police and civil servants after months of protests against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Although Thai soldiers have occasionally expressed sympathy for protesters in past bouts of political unrest, the rapid expansion of social media is making it difficult to contain.
Reuters reviewed dozens of social media posts and messages on chat groups used by soldiers and police and found many expressing sympathy with protesters and anger or unease over the way those who oppose the government are being treated. Some posted about their loyalty to Thailand's institutions. 
It is impossible to establish how far disaffection reaches based on social media activity. But the posts have attracted the attention of authorities. 
“If you are posting things that are creating misunderstanding and provocation that would create instability, that is inappropriate,"" said Colonel Sirijan Ngathong, the army's deputy spokeswoman, adding that commanding officers were reviewing the social media activity of soldiers to prevent breaches of army rules. 
She did not respond to requests for comment on the case involving Ekkachai or whether surveillance had increased since protests escalated in July.
Some posts appeared on the viral video-sharing app TikTok. One TikTok video, now removed, showed a soldier giving the three-fingered salute, a gesture of resistance featured in “The Hunger Games” film that Thailand’s student-led, anti-government protest movement adopted. ""Keep up the struggle, Thai brothers and sisters,"" said the caption. 
The video’s author told Reuters that he is a serving professional soldier but asked that his name not be used.
Some sections of the army have intensified their clampdown. A message posted by a coordinator in a private chat group used by officers in one artillery regiment, reviewed by Reuters, prohibited soldiers from joining protests or giving any political opinions on social media. 
""After finding political expressions that were not suitable, commanders are asked to consider and rectify accordingly and to explain the political situation correctly to troops,"" the message said.
The army did not respond to a request for comment on the message.
It is unclear if disaffection will affect the protests or the way the government responds to them.
""While there is some disaffection within the armed forces, grumblings do not remain significant enough to constitute a significant faction,"" said Paul Chambers, a politics expert at Naresuan University in northern Thailand.
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri declined to comment on disaffection among members of the security forces or civil service, saying only that the country should be focused on dialogue between those with different views.
PROTESTS SWELL
Tens of thousands of people have protested in the streets of Thailand since July, calling for a new constitution and the removal of Prayuth, who led a military coup in 2014. Protesters have also demanded curbs on the powers of the king, until recently a taboo subject in a country where criticism of the monarchy is a crime.
The army plays a pivotal role in Thailand, which has been ruled by serving or former military officers for more than two-thirds of the time since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932. Thailand’s army has seized power 13 times since then and has on several occasions been involved in bloody crackdowns on protesters including in 1973, 1976, 1992 and 2010.
Although many of the coups have had the broad support of the armed forces, cracks in the military have been exposed in the past. During a bloody 2010 crackdown on red-shirted anti-government protesters in Bangkok, some green-uniformed soldiers openly sympathized with the demonstrators, tipping off the group’s leaders ahead of a planned army operation. They were dubbed “watermelons” - green on the outside with red sympathies on the inside.
That same year, rogue general Khattiya Sawasdipol – known as “Seh Daeng” or “Commander Red” - was assassinated after he came out in support of anti-government protesters, showing that displays of disloyalty in the Thai military can be dangerous. 
""Security forces, especially those who have to confront the protesters, are in a stressful position,"" said Kiranee Tammapiban-udom of government consultancy Maverick Consulting Group. They have to follow orders but at the same time are branded ""servants of tyranny"" by protesters, she said.
One protest leader, Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree, said he encouraged security forces to disobey orders. ""Turn your backs to your commanders, the regime will collapse,"" he told Reuters.
Another soldier who had also posted on social media said he was looking to defuse tension rather than escalate it. ""Maybe it's time for the older generation to listen to the young,” he said. “Asking Prayuth to quit and for changes to the constitution is not abolishing the monarchy.""
DRESS CODE: YELLOW
Some Thai police and civil servants are also questioning their roles. Many have been ordered to join official displays of loyalty to the crown, such as lining royal motorcade routes wearing yellow shirts - the king's colour.
Police Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen told Reuters such activities are part of police duty and that law enforcement was politically neutral.
""Is this police work?"" queried one police officer in an internal chat group, responding to a superior officer’s request in the group for participants to join a royal event. The superior officer responded in the chat group that he was passing on orders and that questions should be addressed to more senior levels.
One document seen by Reuters, sent by the Bangkok Metropolitan Police to the Office of Police Strategy, a national body, requested ""250 female police officers and 1,950 male along the route of the royal motorcade"" for a funeral on Oct. 29 in Bangkok. 
""Dress code: yellow shirt with yellow collar. Long black pants, black shoes."" Bangkok police spokesman Kissana said this was a normal police duty.
""Basically, we are disguised as civilians,"" a female police officer in her late 20s from the Royal Thai Police told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous. ""We’re told to wear yellow and shout 'Long live the king'."" Protesters say police are easy to spot on such occasions because of their short haircuts.
One 23-year-old civil servant complained at being ordered to attend a seminar to praise the works of the Chakri dynasty, of which Vajiralongkorn is the 10th king.

""I can't do much, so I donate to the protesters,"" she told Reuters.

Francis spoke of Saturday's attack during his weekly general audience, held virtually from his library in the Vatican because of the coronavirus pandemic.
""I want to assure my prayers for Nigeria, which unfortunately once again has been bloodied by a terroristic massacre,"" the pope said.
Around 30 of the men were beheaded in the attack, which began on Saturday morning in the village of Zabarmari, and the U.N. estimated that at least 110 people were killed across the Jere local government area of Borno state.
""May God welcome them into his peace and comfort their families, and may he convert the hearts of those who commit such horrors, which gravely offend His name,"" Francis said.
There was no claim of responsibility for the attack. 

Such massacres have been carried out in the past by Boko Haram or the Islamic State West Africa Province which are both active in the area, where Islamic militants have killed at least 30,000 people.

DORI, Burkina Faso (Reuters) - Habibou Sore had to pause for breath as she ran barefoot from the approaching gunmen. She was pregnant with twins, due any day.
Soon after arriving at a nearby town in northern Burkina Faso, her feet cut and swollen, Sore gave birth. Then her battle with hunger began.
Attacks by Islamist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have killed thousands of people this year in Africa's Sahel region, an arid belt to the south of the Sahara Desert.
The escalating bloodshed has worsened food shortages that threaten millions in a region already hit by climate change, poverty and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sixteen months after fleeing her village, Sore lives with relatives in the town of Pisilla and eats one small meal a day.
Her twin sons Hassan and Housein each weigh 7 kg (15.5 pounds), the equivalent of a healthy 4-month-old. Their bony legs are covered in sores, their scalps bare in patches. They scream for the milk their mother cannot provide. 
""I am worried about them,"" Sore said, as she rocked the boys on her lap in a clinic in the town of Kaya, surrounded by paintings showing mothers how to breastfeed and the foods required for a balanced diet. ""They are not doing well.""
Over 7 million people face acute hunger in a vast area comprising landlocked Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, as armed groups cut off access to supplies and farmland, figures from the United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP) show.
Burkina Faso is deteriorating fastest. Over half a million children under 5 are acutely malnourished, U.N. figures show. WFP said in October that over 10,000 people were ""one step short of famine"".
""This year has been worse than anything we have seen in the last decade, a worsening situation that is obviously connected to growing conflicts,"" said Christelle Hure, spokeswoman for the Oslo-based Norwegian Refugee Council, which offers shelter for the displaced.
'GREAT LOSS'
This summer's rainy season was one of the heaviest in years, bringing life to the hilly northern savannah where neem, eucalyptus and acacia trees tower over a sea of waist-high golden grass. Farmers say the conditions are perfect for crops and cattle - if only they could reach them.
Sayouba Zabre should be harvesting 10 hectares of millet and sorghum and tending dozens of cattle near his hometown in the Soum region. Instead he is in a camp for displaced people in the Center-North region after fleeing an attack this year.
Camp residents collect wood and dry hibiscus pods on the roofs of their makeshift tents - anything to make money. Zabre planted millet and peanuts, but it is not enough to feed his family. 
""This is a great loss. There is a lot out there this year,"" he said, referring to his farm. ""I should be there.""
Many citizens rely on food from aid agencies that cannot reach some of the worst-hit areas.
Twice this year, food deliveries were hijacked, said Antoine Renard, WFP's country director in Burkina Faso. 
Dozens of health facilities have closed and about 200 others are operating at minimum staff levels, government figures show.
Malnutrition is overwhelming the clinic in Kaya where Sore took her twins. Before the crisis, it had about 30 child patients. Now it has 500.
""Every day we take children, every day we have severe cases,"" said midwife Aminata Zabre.
Mothers come regularly for sachets of baby food, though sometimes there is little improvement.

""I asked one woman 'why is your child still coming to us?',"" Zabre said. ""She told me her father-in-law was eating the child's rations.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States could begin sharing sensitive intelligence with Honduras about inbound flights carrying drugs, U.S. officials told Reuters, even as the Central American country faces scrutiny from Washington over drug-related corruption. 
A proposed memorandum of understanding on intelligence sharing, which has not previously been reported, has yet to be finalized by the U.S. and Honduran governments. Still, Honduras has already agreed to a key U.S. recommendation that it rescind authority to shoot down suspected drug trafficking planes flying into the country.
Washington is proceeding carefully, having learned painful lessons after Peru acted on a CIA tip in 2001 and shot down a plane carrying American Christian missionaries, killing a mother and her infant daughter. 
Former U.S. officials and experts cautioned that sharing intelligence with Honduras about flights entering the country could prove particularly tough, given well-documented, parallel U.S. concerns about corruption inside Honduras stemming from cocaine trafficking.
""It's difficult because you want to collaborate with the Honduran authorities. But Honduras is so pervasively corrupt ... it's difficult in this case to warrant it,"" said Charles Call, a former U.S. State Department adviser at the Brookings Institution think tank.
Honduras' envoy to the United States, Luis Fernando Suazo Barahona, told Reuters his country had demonstrated its commitment to combating drugs and stressed that anyone involved in intelligence sharing would undergo careful vetting.
Navy Admiral Craig Faller, head of the U.S. military's Southern Command, said Honduras, like other Central American nations, was seeing a surge in drug flights from Venezuela. 
Washington indicted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this year for alleged involvement in cocaine smuggling into the United States. Maduro dismissed the accusation.
From October 2019 to June 2020, Central America was the first stop for 90% of the cocaine departing Venezuela via air, according to data from U.S. Southern Command. Of that, 11% landed in Honduras, it said.
""The threat is so significant that it was one of the things that influenced the Honduran government to change their law, their air sovereignty law, which will now allow us to move forward with (intelligence) sharing,"" Faller told Reuters.
'CORRUPTION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS'
Honduran Foreign Minister Lisandro Rosales told Reuters that security forces would use U.S. intelligence on incoming flights to intercept drug smugglers more quickly once the aircraft landed.
The U.S. State Department said in a statement it was ""taking steps to resume information sharing for aerial interception upon the successful negotiation and conclusion"" of the memorandum of understanding.
Experts on Honduras cautioned, however, about the risks of trusting Honduras with sensitive trafficking information.
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was implicated during a New York trial that last year convicted his brother, Honduran politician Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, on drug trafficking charges. Prosecutors accused Tony Hernandez of enjoying the protection of his brother.
Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, former leader of Honduras' Cachiros gang who is now in U.S. custody, testified that he paid bribes to multiple officials including Juan Orlando Hernandez.
Honduras' president denies any wrongdoing, representing himself as tough on drugs and responsible for breaking up the six most powerful cartels in Honduras and extraditing numerous traffickers to the United States.
In its 2020 counter-narcotics report, the State Department said that ""corruption within Honduran law enforcement remains a concern"" and urged the government to ""address impunity at all levels and root out corruption from all institutions.""
""You're not just talking about corrupt police that have allowed drug shipments to go by, or a few bad apples here or there,"" said Adriana Beltran at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group. ""You're talking about corruption at the highest levels.""
Asked about the risks, Southern Command spokeswoman Colonel Amanda Azubuike said Southern Command has long supplied counter-narcotics intelligence to U.S. law enforcement agencies that work with partner nations.

""We are confident in their ability to manage sensitive information with our partners and the complexities that come with these conditions,"" Azubuike said.

Vietnam's central region has had a tough year, with its important tourism industry crippled by the coronavirus pandemic long before the arrival of nine typhoons that wiped out crops and damaged homes of hundreds of thousands people.
The two-month toll surpassed losses for the whole of last year, when disasters killed 132 people and caused 6.2 trillion in damage, official data showed.
""We embraced nine typhoons and two tropical depressions in just two months, from mid-September to mid-November. Those abnormal weather events cost our country 30 trillion dong,"" said Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyen Xuan Cuong in a government statement. 
""We have to make sure our residents are not homeless, suffering from hunger or lacking fresh water post-typhoon,"" Cuong added. 
Vietnam's economic growth is expected to slow to 2%-3% this year after expanding 7.02% in 2019 due to the wider impact of the coronavirus pandemic and natural disasters.
Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline. 

About 11.8 million people in Vietnam's costal provinces are exposed to the threat of intense flooding, with 35% of settlements located on crowded and eroding coastlines, a World Bank report said in October.

BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - It may not be haute couture, but former Indonesian school teacher turned tailor Fredi Lugina Priadi has found a lucrative market for his cat fashions, creating unique costumes and cosplay outfits for cats.
After quitting his job as a teacher, he tried his hand at a number of businesses, including running a motorbike repair shop, before stumbling upon cat fashions, an idea from one of his cat-loving cousins.
The 39-year-old now supplies outfits to picky pet owners looking to dress their felines in everything from superhero outfits for figures like Thor and Superman to cosplay characters, nurse uniforms and even traditional Islamic wear. 
""At first, my cousins who love cats gave me the idea to make these costumes and I thought it was weird,"" said Fredi. 
""But it turned out to be funny to see them with costumes,"" he said, speaking from his rustic workshop with a sewing machine in Bogor just south of the capital Jakarta .
    Since setting up his online business three years ago, he now generates up to 3 million rupiah ($210) a month if he sells at least four pieces a day. Each outfit is priced at between $6 to $10. 
    Customer Risma Sandra Irawan has bought at least 30 outfits for her cat Sogan and puts in orders for special occasions like the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr or at Christmas. 
    ""Its for fun only...it can relieve our stress,"" said Risma, who created an account on social media platform TikTok showing off Sogan's outfits that has more than 50,000 followers. 
While many find it cute, Fredi has received some negative comments on social media from those who consider it cruel to dress up a cat and he advises buyers not to make their pet wear an outfit for too long.

Indeed, in the wake of a boom in social media postings of pets dressed up, often in increasingly bizarre poses or outfits, some animal welfare groups have issued guidelines to make owners more aware of any signs that it may be causing their pet distress.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The captain of a dive boat that caught fire and sank off the California coast in 2019, killing 34 people in one of the state's deadliest maritime disasters, was indicted on Tuesday on federal manslaughter charges, U.S. prosecutors said.
Each of the 34 seaman's manslaughter counts returned against Jerry Nehl Boylan, 67, of Santa Barbara, carries a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison if he is convicted, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles.
The indictment accuses Boylan of causing the deaths of the 33 passengers and one crew member who perished in the Labor Day weekend boat fire by way of ""his misconduct, negligence, and inattention to his duties,"" the prosecutors' statement said.
The grand jury cited three specific federal safety violations - failures to assign a night watch or roving patrol aboard the boat, to conduct sufficient crew training or to conduct adequate fire drills.
The victims had been sleeping below deck aboard the 75-foot Conception when the vessel went up in flames in the early morning hours of Sept. 2, 2019, while anchored in Platt's Harbor near Santa Cruz Island, off the Santa Barbara coast, during a sport diving expedition. 
The five surviving crew members, including Boylan, had been above deck in berths behind the wheelhouse and escaped by leaping overboard as the burning boat sank into the Pacific. They told investigators that flames coming from the passenger quarters were too intense to save anyone trapped below.
Coroner investigators determined the victims died of smoke inhalation.
Following the disaster, the U.S. Coast Guard issued a safety bulletin urging limits on the use of lithium-ion batteries and chargers aboard passenger vessels. The document suggested investigators were looking into the possibility that such batteries may have ignited the Conception fire.
Neither Boylan nor his attorneys were immediately available for comment.

Federal prosecutors informed his lawyers of the indictment after it was filed, and he is expected to surrender to authorities in coming weeks, the U.S. attorney's statement said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts lawmakers on Tuesday approved a major police reform bill in the wake of protests over George Floyd's death in Minneapolis that creates a new system for officer accountability, restricts no-knock warrants and bans chokeholds.
Leaders of the state House of Representatives and Senate called the legislation one of the most comprehensive reform packages to be adopted nationally in response to calls for racial justice in the aftermath of Floyd's death in police custody in May.
Tuesday's votes by the Democratic-led chambers followed efforts by other states and cities from coast to coast to adopt law enforcement reforms.
The Massachusetts legislation faced strong opposition from police unions. The House voted 92-67 to approve the legislation after the Senate voted 28-12 in favor.
Republican Governor Charlie Baker, who put forward his policing legislation in June, has not said if he will sign it. Baker is ""committed to enhancing and improving public safety"" and will review the legislation, a spokesman said. 
A two-thirds vote in each chamber would be required to override a veto by the governor.
Under the legislation, a new commission would have the authority to certify and decertify officers, oversee misconduct investigations and standardize training.
The legislation stops short of limiting ""qualified immunity"" for certified officers. That's a legal doctrine that has nationally helped cops beat back lawsuits that accuse them of excessive force. But the measure would limit those protections if the newly established Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission decertifies an officer for violating a person's right to bias-free professional policing.
The bill also bars officers from using ""chokeholds"" and places restrictions on ""no-knock warrants.""
Officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, entered her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment bearing such a warrant.

The Massachusetts legislation also creates what lawmakers say would be a first-in-the-nation statewide moratorium on biometric surveillance systems, including facial recognition technology.

The 12, who had all faced charges in Hong Kong linked to anti-government protests, have been held virtually incommunicado in a mainland prison since they were detained at sea on Aug. 23, apparently while trying to reach the democratic island of Taiwan.
Chinese authorities said last week members of the group face charges of illegal border crossing and organising an illicit border crossing, which could carry a sentence of up to seven years in jail.
""In your role as Chief Executive, it is incumbent on you to intercede on behalf of these young people to ensure that they are guaranteed justice,"" the parliamentarians said in the letter released late on Tuesday. 
""To continue to fail to do so would be a gross abdication of your responsibility to serve the people of Hong Kong and ensure their wellbeing and safety."" 
The 12 should be returned to Hong Kong immediately, be allowed to nominate legal representatives and given access to their families, they said in the letter.
Hong Kong leader Lam has said the 12 will have to face justice in the mainland and that her government will provide them with ""needed and feasible"" assistance.
Human rights groups and democracy activists have expressed fear over the conditions and treatment of the 12, with families and lawyers for them denied access. 

Chinese authorities have insisted the group be represented by officially appointed lawyers.

Security Council unlikely to act on Iran scientist killing, diplomats say","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Just hours after the assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist, Tehran demanded the United Nations Security Council condemn the killing and take action against those responsible, but diplomats say the call is likely to go unheeded.
At a minimum, the 15-member body could discuss Friday's killing of nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh behind closed doors if a member requests such a meeting or it could agree on - by consensus - a statement on the issue. 
But South Africa's U.N. ambassador, Jerry Matjila, council president for December, said on Tuesday that no member had so far requested to discuss the killing or Iran in general. Diplomats also said there had been no discussion of a statement.
The Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace and security and has the ability to authorize military action and impose sanctions. But such measures require at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, Russia or China.
While no party has claimed responsibility for the killing of Fakhrizadeh - viewed by Western powers as the architect of Iran's abandoned nuclear weapons program - Iran has accused Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has declined to comment.
The United States traditionally shields Israel from any action at the Security Council. Washington has declined to comment on the assassination of the scientist. 
The U.N. investigator on extra-judicial executions, Agnes Callamard, said on Friday that many questions surrounded the killing of Fakhrizadeh, but noted the definition of an extraterritorial targeted killing outside of an armed conflict. 
Callamard posted on Twitter that such a killing was ""a violation of international human rights law prohibiting the arbitrary deprivation of life and a violation of the U.N. Charter prohibiting the use of force extraterritorially in times of peace.""
Iran also addressed its letter on Friday to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. In response, Guterres urged restraint and condemned ""any assassination or extra-judicial killing,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Saturday. 
The Security Council is due to meet on Dec. 22 for its biannual meeting on compliance with a resolution that enshrines a 2015 nuclear accord between world powers and Iran, which U.S. President Donald Trump's administration quit in 2018.
Any council member or Iran could choose to raise the killing of Fakhrizadeh during that meeting.

Metal sculpture in Utah appears to have been demolished,"(Reuters) - The mysterious metal column found standing inexplicably in a remote part of Utah's desert last month was knocked down and dismantled by a group of men who considered it ""trash,"" according to a photographer who documented the object's demise.
As images of the object gleaming amid dusty red rocks spread online, many noted a vague resemblance to the so-called ""monoliths"" in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" prompting strained jokes about a possibly extraterrestrial origin.
But photographer Ross Bernards posted images to Instagram on Monday of what he said were the object's final moments that show there is nothing especially alien about the technology behind the sculpture: it appeared to be sheets of metal riveted to a hollow wooden scaffold. https://www.instagram.com/p/CIOOkwMBkAS
In a caption accompanying a series of pictures of the object, Bernards described driving six hours on Friday with three friends to take some evocative pictures of the object by moonlight.
After getting some shots, he said he heard some voices coming up the canyon, and four men appeared. Bernards wrote that he stepped away so the new group could also enjoy some time alone with the object, only to watch as they began shoving it.
""They gave a couple of pushes on the monolith and one of them said, 'You better have got your pictures,'"" Bernards wrote. ""He then gave it a big push, and it went over, leaning to one side. He yelled back to his other friends that they didn't need the tools. The other guy with him at the monolith then said 'this is why you don't leave trash in the desert.'""
The object soon fell with a loud bang, and the men made quick work of breaking it apart and carting it off in wheelbarrows, Bernards wrote. 
""Leave no trace,"" one of the men told Bernards and his friends.
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which oversees the desert where the object was found, said last week it was not investigating because it considered the object private property, and so a matter for the local sheriff.

20,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 05:21PM ET</span>","Five killed, including baby, as car ploughs into pedestrian zone in Germany","BERLIN (Reuters) - Five people including a nine-month-old baby were killed and up to 15 injured on Tuesday when a speeding car ploughed into a pedestrian area in the western German city of Trier in what authorities said appeared to be a deliberate act.
Witnesses said people screamed in panic and some were thrown into the air by the car as it crashed through the shopping zone.
""We have arrested one person, one vehicle has been secured,"" police said, adding that a 51-year-old German suspect from the Trier area had been overpowered within minutes of the incident and was now being questioned.
Prosecutor Peter Fritzen later told a news conference the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol, and authorities were not working on the assumption that there was any Islamist militant motive to the incident.
Trier Mayor Wolfram Leibe said: ""It looks as if we are talking about a suspect with mental issues, but we should not pass premature judgement.""
Authorities said a more thorough assessment of the suspect's mental health would be necessary to determine whether he could be held criminally liable.
The suspect had spent the last few nights in the vehicle and did not seem to have a fixed address, Trier deputy police chief Franz-Dieter Ankner said. He had borrowed the vehicle, which was registered in someone else's name, and did not appear to have a police record.
Mayor Leibe said a nine-month-old baby was among the dead.
The interior minister of Rhineland-Palatinate state, Roger Lewentz, said two women aged 25 and 73 and a man, 45, all from Trier, were also killed. Later, police said a fifth person had also died, with German media reporting that the latest victim was a 52-year old woman. Several of the injured were in critical condition.
TRUCK ATTACK
The incident shocked residents of Germany's oldest town, founded by the Romans more than 2,000 years ago. 
""We have a driver who ran amok in the city,"" Leibe told public broadcaster SWR.
""I just walked through the city centre and it was just horrible. There is a gym shoe lying on the ground, and the girl it belongs to is dead,"" he said. He told broadcaster N-TV that people who saw the incident were ""totally traumatised"".
The Trierischer Volksfreund quoted a witness as saying a Range Rover was driving at high speed and people had been thrown through the air. It said the car had Trier plates.
Officers scoured the area in search of evidence, backed by police carrying automatic weapons. In the streets, Christmas lights twinkled incongruously.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement: ""The news from Trier makes me very sad. My sympathy goes to the families of those whose lives were so suddenly and violently torn away from them. I am also thinking of the people who suffered injuries, in some cases very serious ones, and I wish them strength.""
Germany has tightened security on pedestrian zones across the country since a truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 that killed 12 people and injured dozens.
In October 2019, a man opened fire on a synagogue in the city of Halle. After failing to get into the building he went on a rampage outside, killing two people.
In February this year a racist gunman killed nine migrants in Hanau near Frankfurt before killing his mother and himself. 
Germany has closed bars and restaurants as part of steps to fight the coronavirus, but shops and schools are still open.

Russia's RIA news agency and other state media said investigators believe him to be a serial killer known as the Volga Maniac who preyed on retired women living alone in twelve different regions in 2011-12, most of them near the Volga River. 
The Investigative Committee that handles probes into serious crimes identified the suspect as a metalworker named Radik Tagirov, 38, who was jailed for theft in 2009 and released in 2010. His lawyer could not be reached for comment. 
The agency said it had DNA samples linking the suspect to the killings. He was apprehended at an address in the city of Kazan, it added. 
The Vesti state television channel aired footage of a man it said was the suspect admitting to strangling women, a method he described as ""quiet, quick and painless for them, I thought.""
The killer used nearby objects such as a dressing-gown cord and a cable for an iron to strangle victims, RIA reported. 
Authorities had offered a reward of up to 3 million roubles for information on his whereabouts and been looking for him for years.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",Canada PM Trudeau indicates U.S. border restrictions to last a long time,"By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will not agree to lifting a ban on non-essential travel with the United States until the coronavirus outbreak is significantly under control around the world, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday.
Trudeau's comments were a clear indication that the border restrictions will last well into 2021. The two neighbors agreed to the ban in March and have rolled it over on a monthly basis ever since.
The ban does not affect trade. The two countries have highly integrated economies and Canada sends 75% of its goods exports to the United States every month.
""Until the virus is significantly more under control everywhere around the world, we're not going to be releasing the restrictions at the border,"" Trudeau told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. when asked about the issue.
""We are incredibly lucky that trade in essential goods, in agricultural products, in pharmaceuticals is flowing back and forth as it always has,"" he said.
Trudeau spoke the day after his minority Liberal government said the budget deficit would hit a historic C$381.6 billion ($294.7 billion) on COVID-19 aid and promised to spend an additional C$100 billion in stimulus.
Trudeau, who relies on other parties to govern, would be toppled if the House of Commons votes against the measures but he dismissed that as unlikely.
""I am reasonably confident none of the opposition parties wants an election right now,"" he later told reporters.
The border restrictions are opposed by the travel industry, hit by a slumping number of tourists.
But the premiers of Canada's major provinces say they have no interest in re-opening the border as long as cases of COVID-19 escalate in the United States. 

A second wave is also sweeping across Canada, where authorities are starting to re-impose restrictions on businesses and limit the size of gatherings.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>","Ethiopia war may turn into guerrilla insurgency, experts say","ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia's nearly month-long war against rebellious northern forces may be transforming into a guerrilla conflict, experts said on Tuesday, even though federal troops declared victory after capturing the Tigrayan regional capital at the weekend.
Fighting since Nov. 4 is believed to have killed thousands of people, as well as forcing refugees into Sudan, dragging in Eritrea, and worsening hunger and suffering among Tigray's more than 5 million people. 
Reports of clashes between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's soldiers and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) were still coming out of the region, though communications remain largely cut and outside access blocked. 
Abiy accuses the TPLF of treason, specifically for attacking an army base, while the Tigrayans say their ex-military comrade and partner in government wants to dominate their ethnic group for personal power. Both sides scoff at the other's accusations.
Federal forces took Tigray's highland capital Mekelle in hours on Saturday. TPLF leaders fled to the hills, saying they were resisting and taking prisoners.
Asked about ongoing fighting, TPLF head Debretsion Gebremichael said in a text: ""Yes. On three directions. Two around Mekelle. One 50 km away.""
There was no immediate response from the government. 
Reuters has been unable to verify claims from both sides. 
On Tuesday, a senior TPLF politician surrendered to federal forces, the government said.
Keria Ibrahim was one of the TPLF's nine executive committee leaders and had been the speaker of the House of Federation, a national body dealing with constitutional matters, until she resigned in June over the postponement of national elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
SKIRMISHES CONTINUING
Two regionally run Tigrayan TV stations, including the TPLF's ""Dimtsi Woyane"" (""Voice of the Revolution""), were still on air, although it was unclear where they were broadcasting from. Government-affiliated media have not yet broadcast any images from Mekelle.
A United Nations aid worker in touch with people in Tigray said large areas remained outside federal control and fighting was still taking place on several fronts. There was still scant coordination with aid workers, the source added.
""There are skirmishes continuing in many parts of Tigray and we are seeing the hallmarks of the beginning of an insurgency,"" Horn of Africa expert Rashid Abdi told an online forum. 
""The terrain, geography and history suggest this will be a long, drawn-out insurgency.""
Both the federal army and the TPLF have long military experience - from toppling a Marxist dictator in 1991 to fighting neighbouring Eritrea from 1998-2000.
Though outnumbered and expelled from their capital, the Tigrayans can exploit their mountainous terrain and long borders with Sudan and Eritrea. 
REFUGEES 
The U.N. refugee agency appealed for access to 96,000 Eritrean refugees in Tigray, where food was thought to be running out.
""Our extreme worry is that we hear about attacks, the fighting near the camps, we hear about abductions and forced removals,"" spokesman Babar Baloch told a news briefing in Geneva. 
In a speech to parliament on Monday, Abiy urged the more than 45,000 Ethiopians who fled into Sudan to return.
One aid worker in the area said numbers crossing to Sudan at the main transit point of Hamdayet were down to a trickle. Refugees were saying that Ethiopian militia and soldiers were trying to impede them, he said.
""The accounts of the people are that it's getting harder and harder to get to the border,"" he said, adding that three refugees had also said there were flyers going round with messages not to speak in Tigrayan.
There was no immediate government response to those accusations, but federal officials vehemently deny discrimination against Tigrayans or harassment of civilians.
Though Tigrayans make up only about 6% of Ethiopia's 115 million people, they dominated national government for nearly three decades until Abiy took office in 2018. 
Abiy, whose parents are from the larger Oromo and Amharic groups, has been removing Tigrayans from government and military posts, saying they made up more than 60% of senior ranks and that other ethnicities should also be represented. 

Last year, Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade border standoff with Eritrea. The TPLF has fired rockets towards Eritrea's capital Asmara during the conflict.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States accused China on Tuesday of ""flagrant violation"" of its obligation to enforce international sanctions on North Korea and offered rewards of up to $5 million for information about sanctions evasions.
Speaking to Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, Deputy Assistant Secretary for North Korea Alex Wong accused China of seeking to undo a U.N. sanctions regime aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
Wong said China had continued to host at least 20,000 North Korean laborers in violation of U.N. bans, and that in the past year the United States had observed ships carrying prohibited coal or other sanctioned goods from North Korea to China on 555 separate occasions.
""On none of these occasions did the Chinese authorities act to stop these illicit imports,"" Wong said. ""Not once."" 
He said China currently hosted at least two dozen North Korean representatives connected to Pyongyang's weapons programs or banks, and Chinese firms had continued to do business with U.N.-sanctioned entities with key roles in those programs.
Wong said China ""increasingly allows"" its companies to conduct trade with North Korea in a broad spectrum of U.N.- prohibited goods, including seafood, textiles, iron and steel, industrial machinery, vehicles, sand and gravel.
""In no other country do we see this breadth and depth of continuing illicit commercial activity with North Korea, the scale of which puts China in flagrant violation of its obligations,"" he said.
""They are seeking to revive trade links and revenue transfers to the North, thereby ensuring Chinese reach into the North’s economy.""
China says it abides by U.N. sanctions on North Korea, although it has also, along with Russia, expressed hope that an easing of those conditions could help break the deadlock in nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
Wong said the State Department was launching a website through which people could provide information on North Korea sanctions evasion in return for up to $5 million.
The United States has also accused China of helping North Korea to launder money from cyber thefts carried out to raise funds for its weapons programs.
Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump held two unprecedented summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons.

In October, North Korea unveiled one of the world's largest road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. Experts said it would be capable of reaching any point in the United States if it becomes operational.

""On 1 December, a judge said Ahmadreza was to be transferred to Rajai Shahr prison TODAY to proceed with his imminent execution,"" Amnesty International said on Twitter.
""His lawyer was informed that Ahmadreza would be transferred to Rajai Shahr Prison ... today (Tuesday, Dec. 1),"" Iran Human Rights said in a statement, quoting his wife Vida Mehrannia.

Sweden's foreign minister said last week she had spoken to her Iranian counterpart after reports Iran may soon carry out Djalali's death sentence.
Djalali, a medical doctor and lecturer at the Karolinska Institute in the Swedish capital Stockholm, was arrested in Iran in 2016 and later convicted of espionage, having been accused of providing information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists. Iran's Supreme Court in 2017 upheld the death sentence.
Rights activists have accused Iran of arresting a number of dual nationals to try to win concessions from other countries. Tehran has regularly dismissed the accusation.

The Russian Defence Ministry's Zvezda TV station said the mobile air defence system designed to counter ballistic and aerial attacks was on Iturup, one of four islands held by Russia that Japan claims and calls the Northern Territories. 
""Short-range anti-aircraft missile systems are already on duty on the island of Iturup in Sakhalin Region. Now the air defence 'heavy artillery' has arrived. The so-called large air defence system: the S-300V4,"" Zvezda said. 
The Soviets seized the islands, known as the Southern Kuriles, at the end of World War Two and a territorial row over them has prevented the two sides signing a formal peace treaty since and strained relations for years. 
Japan is highly sensitive to military moves by Russia on the strategically important chain of islands that stretch northeast from Japan's Hokkaido to the Russian Far East region of Kamchatka. 
Russia said in October it planned to deploy the missile system on the islands for the first time, but that the move would be part of military drills and not for combat duty. 
The deployment comes not long after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who mounted a push to resolve the dispute and tried to win over Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced he was stepping down in August.

""We need support ... to keep our heads above water,"" said Alberto Cabral, who runs a nightclub.
The protesters - camping outside parliament and living off water, tea and coffee donated by their supporters - say they will not eat until they are met by the prime minister and economy minister.
One more business owner joined their strike on Sunday. 
Bars and nightclubs have been closed since March and while restaurants were allowed to reopen in May, a curfew and weekend lockdown in place across most of the country since Nov. 8 has angered restaurateurs, who say many of their businesses will not survive the year.
""It's just insolvencies, insolvencies,"" restaurant owner Joao Sotto Mayor said. ""Many businesses depend on this time ... it's incredibly important that next weekend we return to normal opening hours.""
An online petition by the movement behind the strike is gathering steam, with nearly 45,000 signatures so far and gaining several thousand each hour.
In compensation for weekend lockdowns, the government offered restaurants 20% of their average revenue between January and October of this year.
Owners say this is nowhere near enough.
""How can we sustain a company that isn't earning any money but has to pay taxes, pay for light, water?"" asked Jose Gouveia, a nightclub owner and spokesman for the movement.
The number of people registered as unemployed jumped 34.5% in October from last year's figures with around 72% of the newly unemployed working in restaurants or retail, according to government data.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",Analysis: Iran's Achilles' heel? Security gaps and possible enemy infiltration,"By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - The killing of Iran's top nuclear scientist has exposed security gaps which suggest its security forces may have been infiltrated and that the Islamic Republic is vulnerable to further attacks.
Mohsen Fakhrizadeh's killing on Friday followed two other big security lapses -- the theft of Iran's nuclear archive and a fire at a nuclear facility this year that some Iranian officials blamed on cyber sabotage.
With Fakhrizadeh the fifth Iranian nuclear scientist killed in targeted attacks since 2010, security experts are suggesting Iran's enemies have found its Achilles' heel.
Commander Hossein Dehghan, a former defence minister, told state television Fakhrizadeh had been killed because of ""infiltration into Iran's security structure.""
Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards' Security Force, or Close Protection Unit, assigns bodyguards and security officers to top military and civilian officials.
""His assassins obviously operated based on detailed intelligence about martyr Fakhrizadeh's movements,"" an Iranian security official told Reuters after Fakhrizadeh was killed in an attack on his car on a highway near Tehran in broad daylight.
""It is clearly a security weakness and many questions should be answered,"" said the official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""We should know whether there are spies among security people and locate the leak. This is essential for us."" 
Iran's military and clerical rulers have accused Israel of killing Fakhrizadeh. Israel had identified him as a prime player in what it says is Iran's nuclear weapons quest though Tehran denies seeking nuclear arms.
Israel has not commented on the incident but in the past has acknowledged pursuing covert operations against Iran's nuclear programme to gather intelligence. 
""There are conflicting accounts on how Fakhrizadeh was assassinated, but a degree of infiltration is certain – and this is what worries the Islamic Republic the most,"" said Kasra Aarabi, an Iran analyst at the Tony Blair Institute for Change think tank. 
CONTRADICTORY SCENARIOS
Iran has given contradictory details of the killing of Fakhrizadeh. Shortly after he was killed, witnesses told state television that a truck exploded before a group of gunmen opened fire on Fakhrizadeh's car.
On Sunday, Ali Shamkhani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, told state TV it was ""a very sophisticated assassination that was carried out remotely with electronic devices"" and with no people on the ground. 
""We have no idea whether these reports of a satellite-controlled-truck-mounted-machine-gun are true, but they serve two key purposes for Tehran: trying to deflect embarrassment by portraying the assassination as remarkably sophisticated; and showing how quickly they can crack the case,"" said Henry Rome, senior analyst with Eurasia Group.
Iran's inability to thwart such operations could encourage future attempts. 
""The existence of large chinks in Iran's nuclear armour is sure to raise questions over the role sabotage could or should play in any future counter proliferation policy towards Tehran,"" said Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) think tank in Washington.
In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel had smuggled hundreds of kilograms of paper and digital files on Iran's secret nuclear weapons programme out of the Islamic Republic. Iran rejected this as fraudulent. 
Fakhrizadeh's killing comes months after a U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Qassem Soleimani, head of the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds Force. Tehran retaliated by launching missile strikes against U.S. targets in Iraq.
In July, Iran executed an Iranian man convicted of spying for U.S. and Israeli intelligence. The Judiciary said Mahmoud Mousavi-Majd, who was arrested in 2018, had spied on Soleimani but that the case was not connected to Soleimani’s killing on Jan. 3. 
""CRUSHING"" RESPONSE OR NOT?
Iran has said it will launch a ""crushing"" response to Fakhrizadeh's killing. 
Political analysts said retaliatory measures could make it hard for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, to scrap President Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" policy on Iran.
Biden has said that if Tehran resumes compliance with the 2015 agreement with six powers limiting its nuclear programme, he will return to the pact, which Trump quit in 2018 and then reimposed sanctions that have hit Iran's economy hard. 
""Iran will retaliate but it will not be a crushing response that could lead to full-blown war with Israel,"" said an analyst in Tehran, who asked not to be named. 
President Hassan Rouhani has said Iran will retaliate for Fakhrizadeh's killing at ""the proper time"" but will not ""fall into Israel's trap"" in the last weeks of Trump's presidency.
""Considering that Trump is still in the White House for another two months, Tehran's escalation options are going to have to be restrained,"" said Taleblu. ""Despite talk of a potential military reprisal against Israel directly, that would be a low-probability high-impact scenario.""

30,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Friends or foes? Syrian refugees divided on fate of defectors,"By Joseph Nasr
GERA, Germany (Reuters) - Should former members of the Syrian security forces who have defected from President Bashar al-Assad's government be prosecuted for war crimes, or should they serve as key witnesses in an effort to bring senior officials to justice?
The question has divided Syrian refugees and exiles who have fled a civil war in which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and that has been marked by atrocities since it broke out in 2011.
In Germany, home to 600,000 Syrian refugees, prosecutors have used universal jurisdiction laws that allow them to prosecute crimes against humanity committed anywhere in the world to seek justice for victims of alleged torture and extrajudicial killings by Assad's forces.
In the first case to be brought to a German court, the trial opened in April of two former Syrian intelligence officers on charges of torture and sexual assault.
The two suspects had defected in 2012 and were granted asylum in Germany. Many of the Syrians now in Germany are asking if the defectors are friends or foes.
""The trial in Germany is wrong, strategically and morally. Defectors risked their lives to join the opposition and discredit the regime,"" said Fawaz Tello, a veteran Syrian dissident.
""Who in their right mind is going to defect now when they see that people who had defected in the first months of the revolution are being put on trial?""
The Syrian government has regularly rejected reports of torture and extrajudicial killings documented by international human rights groups.
JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS
Mahmoud Alabdulah, a former colonel in the Syrian army's elite 4th Division, is one of hundreds of defectors who have given testimonies to German and French judicial officials collecting evidence of alleged war crimes by the Syrian government during the still-unresolved war.
He says a military card identifying his rank is the most valuable item of the few belongings he carried when he left Syria six years ago.
The pink, plastic-covered piece of paper has given more credence to testimonies he delivered in France and Germany against the Syrian government, he says.
""I saw soldiers being executed for refusing to open fire on protesters and heavy artillery fired toward civilian areas,"" said Alabdulah, a 56-year-old father of five, rolling a cigarette in a modest apartment in the eastern German city of Gera where he lives with his wife.
""I remember the night I decided to defect: February 13, 2012,"" Alabdulah said. ""I was praying in my room, lights off, at the Saboura military base (west of Damascus) and I said, 'God, I don't want to take part in such crimes, please help me get out of here'.""
Campaigners have hailed the process in Germany as a first step toward justice for thousands of Syrians who say they were tortured in government facilities after attempts to establish an international tribunal for Syria failed.
""No one has the right to tell victims they should not seek justice,"" said Anwar al-Bunni of the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) which is representing victims in the torture trial.
""Ignoring suspected war criminals is equivalent to white-washing the Assad regime.""
The main defendant in the trial, Anwar R., is charged with 58 murders in a Damascus prison where prosecutors say at least 4,000 opposition activists were tortured in 2011 and 2012. He has denied all the charges.
He was an intelligence colonel in Assad's security apparatus but defected in 2012 to Turkey, where he became active in the opposition Free Syrian Army. He came to Germany in 2014 and was granted asylum.
The dissident Tello said Anwar R. was a member of an opposition delegation at U.N.-sponsored talks in Geneva six years ago aimed at ending the conflict, which makes his trial a ""humiliation"" for opposition groups marred by infighting.
Former army colonel Alabdulah questioned whether it was realistic for everyone who committed a crime to face justice.
Asked if he feared charges could be filed against him, Alabdulah told Reuters his conscience was clear. He fought against Assad's forces and Islamic State militants before he fled to Turkey, he said.
""We are not even close to winning the war. Even if we did, there should be some kind of a general amnesty,"" he said. ""The Assad family and its most loyal lieutenants should be tried.""

31,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: European allies pushed back when Trump sanctioned Iran’s banks,"By John O'Donnell and Jonathan Saul
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Germany, France and Britain urged the Trump administration in late October to reconsider broad, new sanctions against Iran’s banks, arguing that the move would deter legitimate humanitarian trade and hurt the allies’ common interests, diplomatic correspondence shows.
Germany’s Bundesbank also kept a multi-billion-euro deposit facility open for Iranian banks, including two that faced fresh U.S. sanctions, giving Tehran a much-needed banking lifeline at a time its access to the global financial system was largely cut off, according to central bank data and interviews with bankers, Western diplomats and officials.
The behind-the-scenes pushback to Washington and the extent of Germany’s support to Iranian trade in the face of U.S. sanctions have not been previously reported, and shed new light on the divergent approaches to Iran taken by President Donald Trump and the U.S. allies.
The letter came after the United States imposed sanctions on October 8 against 18 Iranian banks as part of a campaign to exert “maximum pressure” on Tehran. The order barred Americans further from dealing with the Iranian banks and extended secondary sanctions on foreign companies that did business with those lenders. For foreign banks, violations could mean losing access to the U.S. market and raise the spectre of hefty penalties, even although U.S. sanctions, legally speaking, don't apply in Europe and other jurisdictions. 
In their joint letter, dated October 26, diplomats from the three European nations told Washington that the sanctions could make food and medicine ""prohibitively expensive"" for ordinary Iranians in the middle of the pandemic. 
“The US has always said that its aim was to target the ruling elite and not the Iranian population,” according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. “In our view it is important to uphold this undertaking in practice.”
They sought reassurances that the United States would “not impose penalties on financial institutions processing humanitarian trade in good faith without first engaging with them.”
In a statement to Reuters, the U.S. State Department said that Washington wants to ensure sanctions do not impede humanitarian assistance to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
A spokesperson with Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said the UK ""does not agree with these sanctions, which affect a number of banks helping the Iranian people access vital humanitarian supplies.""
France’s foreign ministry declined to comment. A French diplomatic source said the letter was part of ongoing efforts by the three countries to make clear to the U.S. administration that it would not give up on the Iran deal.
A German government official said that humanitarian channels need to remain open and that it has advocated for this. 
A Bundesbank spokesman confirmed that Iranian banks held accounts with it in order to process payments but declined to comment on them individually. ""The German Bundesbank is bound by national and European law, also, naturally, in relation to financial sanctions,"" the spokesman said.
The Iranian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL    
The Iran nuclear accord of 2015 was a key achievement for President Barack Obama’s international diplomacy until Trump withdrew from the deal in May 2018, and started imposing a new round of unilateral sanctions on Tehran.
Financial support for trade, one of the central tenets of the agreement, has since shrivelled, hitting Iran’s economy hard. The Institute of International Finance, a global group of financial institutions, estimates that the Iranian economy contracted by about 6% for the third consecutive year because of the impact of sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic.
Tehran, meanwhile, has cited the general absence of financial support from European powers as a reason for ignoring parts of the nuclear deal. Ratcheting tensions further, the country’s top nuclear scientist was assassinated in recent days.
Germany, France and Britain, which were also signatories to the 2015 deal, are hoping President-elect Joe Biden would change course. Biden, set to take office on January 20, has said he will re-join the pact if Iran resumes compliance.
One European diplomat said that Germany was now leading preparations to salvage the deal. The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain met in Berlin at the end of November to discuss Iran in a meeting France’s foreign ministry said was aimed at preserving the nuclear deal. 
German lawmaker Klaus Ernst told Reuters that Berlin was keen that trade was revived. 
""Europe needs to win its independence from America when making international payments,” said Ernst, who chairs the Bundestag's economy and energy committee. “Trade is the best way of getting Iran to change for the better.”
BUNDESBANK DEPOSITS    
Germany’s political position, informed by historical ties with Iran, has helped its banks and companies play a leading role in trade with Iran, according to two experts in international payments.
Justine Walker, head of global sanctions and risk with ACAMS, an organisation of specialists tackling financial crime, said Germany stood out for its willingness to hold Iranian accounts – a stance that has continued despite the U.S. sanctions.
Five Iranian banks - all of which are subject to U.S. sanctions - held roughly 3.8 billion euros on deposit with the Bundesbank at the beginning of the year, according to the banks' financial accounts. Some of this money has since been withdrawn, but the level of financial exposure is still above 3 billion euros, Bank for International Settlements data from June shows. 
U.S. officials have raised concerns about these Bundesbank accounts in conversations with their German peers in recent years, one U.S. official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. 
The funds are used by the Iranian banks to facilitate transactions to companies doing business with Iran, according to two finance sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Reuters could not learn how long these payment facilities for Tehran have existed.  
One of these banks is the German unit of Iranian state-owned Bank Melli, which was sanctioned in 2018.
Helmut Gottlieb, a board member and top manager at the bank, said although the scope of the bank’s activities had narrowed, it still offered loans to companies that do business with Iran.
""Under Trump, we’ve come under increasing pressure from the Americans,"" Gottlieb said. He added that the Melli’s German unit is regularly audited and must meet standards set by Bundesbank and other European regulators.
COMMON INTERESTS 
One of the banks with an account with the Bundesbank is mentioned in the October letter. The bank is among a handful that the Europeans singled out as worthy of exemption from secondary sanctions because of their focus on financing humanitarian trade and proven record of compliance. 
The European allies make a broad plea for leniency, however, the letter shows. They argue against cutting off the sanctioned banks’ access to the SWIFT payment messaging system and express worries about the impact on Instex, a fledgling mechanism set up to barter humanitarian goods and food with Iran. 
They also argued that the sanctions would make it more difficult for diplomatic missions, international organizations and non-profits to maintain their presence in Iran.

“The humanitarian needs of the Iranian population are acute and require an effective response. Actively hindering such a response will damage our common interests,” they wrote.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Spare a thought for this year's Nobel Prize winners.
Gone are the ball gowns, white tie and tails, concerts, banquets and adulation that come with arguably the world's most coveted awards. With the coronavirus pandemic tearing through Europe, celebrations this year will be modest and remote.
Instead of wining and dining in Stockholm and Oslo later this month, in many cases winners will receive their award in their home country at an agreed venue from a Swedish diplomat.
The number of guests will depend on local restrictions, and plans are still subject to change given the unpredictability of the virus.
""We...will make sure that the laureates receive their medals and diplomas in one way or the other, if the situation changes,"" said Rebecka Oxelstrom, spokeswoman for the Nobel Foundation, which overseas the prizes.
The low-key celebrations will matter to some laureates more than others.
Reinhard Genzel, the German astrophysicist who shared the physics prize this year with Britain's Roger Penrose and American Andrea Ghez for discoveries about black holes, was not losing too much sleep.
""I'm not a party boy, anyhow,"" he told Reuters.
""Of course I would have preferred to have this highest point of my research career to be celebrated in Stockholm, mainly also to celebrate with my family and my core science team,"" he added.
""Yet, given the global situation, the Nobel Committee did exactly the right thing.""
MAY BE NEXT YEAR
Sweden's Nobel Foundation, which handles Nobel Prizes apart from the peace award which is administered by the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, has been working out the logistics of how to honour winners around the world.
This year's ceremonies will be short, with medals and diplomas laid out on a table. They take place on Dec. 7 and 8.
""Gloves will be used when unpacking the medal and diploma,"" Oxelstrom said.
Venues will vary. Genzel, for example, said he will receive his medal in the Bavarian State Chancellery in Munich, while others will be handed out at Swedish diplomatic residences or scientific institutes.
Literature winner Louise Gluck and medicine laureate Michael Houghton will receive their diplomas and medals in their homes.
The traditional lectures will be streamed next week on the Nobel organisation's website, as will a concert from the Stockholm Concert Hall, without an audience, on Dec. 8, two days before the main event.
On Thursday, Dec. 10, the Swedish king gives a digital welcome as part of the main prize giving, which will include footage of the individuals receiving their awards. It will be beamed from Stockholm City Hall to Nobel Prize digital channels.
It is a far cry from normal times, when laureates attend the glitzy ceremony before enjoying a sumptuous banquet, along with around 1,300 other guests, including royalty and Sweden's cultural elite.
It is the first time the banquet has been cancelled since 1956, in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary.
As for the peace prize in Oslo, final details of handing the Peace medal to David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme, in Rome, were still being worked out, said Olav Njolstad, Director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute.
That presentation will be streamed live on nobelprize.org.
All may not be lost, however, for laureates who want to taste some of the pomp and ceremony of normal times.
Organisers said that winners will be invited to the 2021 celebrations - assuming the pandemic has eased by then.

""They will get the full package, hopefully, at a later stage,"" Njolstad said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Juan Guaido will still be Venezuela's legitimate head of state even if he loses his seat as head of the country's parliament on Sunday, Chile's foreign minister said on Tuesday, saying the Dec. 6 vote for a new assembly lacked any credibility.
Opposition leader Guaido is recognised by dozens of countries, including the United States and most of the European Union (EU), as the nation's rightful leader following the disputed 2018 re-election of President Nicolas Maduro.
But his institutional standing rests on his post as head of the national assembly, which he is almost certain to lose from January as Maduro seeks to take control of the opposition-held assembly in a vote that many countries believe will be rigged.
""We assign no legitimacy to the elections next Sunday,"" Chile's Foreign Minister Andres Allamand told reporters during a visit to Brussels, where he met EU lawmakers and diplomats.
""We continue to work under the premise that the legitimate authority that exists in Venezuela is Guaido,"" said Allamand, whose country gave protection to another Venezuelan opposition politician, Leopoldo Lopez, in 2019 at its diplomatic residence in Caracas.
Maduro has said he is bound by Venezuela's constitution to hold the vote on Dec. 6, a date the EU has said is too rushed to allow for international observers and ensure it is free and fair.
Like the United States, most of Latin American and the EU want a new presidential election to reverse Venezuela's spiral into authoritarian rule and economic collapse.
Allamand called on European, North American and Latin American governments who have led different diplomatic initiatives to come together, denounce Sunday's vote results and find a path to free presidential elections in Venezuela. 

Some 4.5 million refugees and migrants have fled Venezuela since 2015, according to official figures, but the real figure is higher, the United Nations has said.

The robbery began just before midnight on Monday in the southern city of Criciúma and lasted nearly two hours, according to a statement from military police in Santa Catarina state. Of the two people who were injured, one was a police officer.
Terrifying images shared on social media showed armed men firing automatic weapons on the city streets, taking hostages and then making their getaway in a fleet of cars. In their wake, the robbers left cash strewn across the streets. Residents soon spread out to snatch up the notes, television footage showed.
""So far, four people have been arrested who collected part of the paper bills that were thrown to the ground due to the explosion,"" the police said. 
Authorities have located 810,000 reais ($152,660), police added. Local media reported that there were 30 robbers involved in the heist. 
Brazil has a long history of bank heists, and major lenders have struggled with a wave of violent robberies in recent years as criminals have mastered the use of explosives to access cash.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The trial of a former Liberian commander accused of rape, pillage, assassinations, and an act of cannibalism opens in Switzerland this week.
The trial of Alieu Kosiah, who denies the charges, is one of just a handful of cases brought before international courts in relation to the West African country's 1989-2003 conflict, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people, often at the hands of child soldiers.
He is accused of war crimes listed as ""recruitment and use of a child soldier, forced transportation, looting, cruel treatment of civilians, attempted murder, murder (directly or by order), desecration of a corpse and rape"".
It is Switzerland's first war crimes trial to be heard outside a military court.
""This is historic for Switzerland and Liberia,"" said Alain Werner, a Swiss lawyer at Geneva-based NGO Civitas Maxima which filed the complaint on behalf of victims.
The NGO was researching war crimes with a Liberian partner when they discovered a rebel commander was living near Lake Geneva. Kosiah was arrested in 2014 and Switzerland filed an indictment against him in 2019.
The case involves dozens of witnesses, thousands of pages of testimony and has been complicated, according to the Swiss Attorney general's office, by a lack of official Liberian cooperation. The trial is set to open on Thursday at the Federal Criminal Court in Bellinzona.
Kosiah, 45, says he wants to clear his name. Some of the charges are attributed to troops under his command.
""According to Mr. Alieu Kosiah, one of the big problems with this case is he had not yet arrived in Lofa (county) at the time of the crimes he supposedly committed there,"" his lawyer Dimitri Gianoli told Reuters.
""What counts for (him) is to be able to officially re-establish his honour by making himself heard openly and clearly,"" he said. ""(He) has always been very clear on his whereabouts in Liberia and the court filings include testimonies collected in Switzerland that confirm it.""
'VOICE TO THE DEAD'
Unlike neighbour Sierra Leone which had its own civil war in the 1990s, Liberian perpetrators have never faced prosecution at home despite a recommendation by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to create a war crimes court.
Liberia's former President Charles Taylor was sentenced in 2012 for war crimes in Sierra Leone, but was never convicted for Liberian acts.
Others arrested in Europe have yet to appear in court. 
Former warlords retain positions of power in Liberia and witnesses have been reluctant to come forward amid threats.
""This trial gives hope to victims, to the survivors, and gives voice to the dead,"" said Hassan Bility who collected evidence for the case and was himself tortured in the conflict.
Human Rights Watch's Elise Keppler said she hoped the trial would serve as a ""wake-up call"" for Liberia.
The court will hear Kosiah next week.

Liberian plaintiffs cannot attend due to COVID restrictions and will instead testify in 2021. Kosiah faces a maximum possible sentence of 20 years.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 07:56AM ET</span>",Chefs versus scientists: France's pandemic fight to keep eating out,"By Elizabeth Pineau and Caroline Pailliez
PARIS (Reuters) - ""Chez Francoise"" is a discreetly located venue near the French parliament whose visitors' book boasts signatures from former leaders including Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. Options include a ""Menu Parlementaire"" - three courses including wild boar pate with chestnuts, veal and crepes suzette.
In late September, as a second wave of COVID-19 infection loomed, government scientific advisers wanted new restrictions on bars, restaurants and cafes.
Fearing his business would suffer, Pascal Mousset, who owns Chez Francoise and four other restaurants in the French capital, decided to seek help from an old contact. ""For pity's sake, don't close Paris,"" Mousset texted to Alain Griset, a junior minister at the finance and economy ministry.
Mousset recounted the exchange in an interview with Reuters. Until Griset joined the government in July, the politician was a regular at ""Chez Francoise."" Griset said he had known Mousset for years, but that their contacts over COVID-19 were part of a normal exchange of views between government and business representatives. 
Mousset's effort illustrates a broader campaign in France and globally by business owners to push back against curbs sought by scientists to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. In Paris, it appeared to help, at least for a while. Restaurants and cafes stayed open for a few more weeks. 
It's a fight that has played out in different ways around the world. In France – the country that invented haute cuisine, where many voters see cafes and bars as fundamental to life - the hospitality business took their cause to the highest political levels. 
Celebrity chefs made their case on chat shows. Restaurateurs protested on the streets. And the campaign, described to Reuters by more than a dozen people who were involved on all sides, involved many meetings behind closed doors. 
The battle was often unequal, according to four scientists involved in advising the French government. They said their understanding of virus transmission sometimes took a back seat to what was politically and socially acceptable. 
For Yazdan Yazdanpanah, a member of the Scientific Council, an independent advisory body consulted by the government, the experience showed the scientific community needed to work harder to make itself heard. 
""Should we have taken tougher, more coercive measures?"" he said. ""Should we have explained things better? We need to learn how to make an effort with communication, with education, much more than before.""
A health ministry spokesman said the government had always put public health interests first. A spokeswoman for the French presidential administration said consultation with industry groups was done in a transparent way. 
""At no point did we compromise on the public health advice,"" she said.
Two months on, restaurateurs are again fighting for relief from a renewed lockdown. New infections in France have retreated from an early November peak, but the country is averaging more than 500 deaths a day, one of the most globally. 
WAY OF LIFE
French people spend more time than those of any other developed nation eating or drinking, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. A significant share of that is spent in cafes and restaurants. For many working people, lunch with colleagues or clients is the focal point of the day. 
""It's a virus that's very damaging for the way of life a la Francaise - eating, a glass of wine, a chat,"" said Julien Borowczyk, a doctor and member of parliament who is chairing a commission into how the government managed the epidemic.
On top of this, the Paris region has the highest concentration in Europe of jobs in accommodation and food services, with just under 400,000 people working in the sector in 2017, according to data from the European Union statistics agency Eurostat.
In August, French people were enjoying their summer. The first lockdown had ended in May, cases were down sharply, and the country's nearly 200,000 bars, restaurants and cafes were buzzing. 
But already that month, infections were accelerating. The Scientific Council had warned officials to expect a resurgence of infections. 
On Sept. 11, the U.S. government's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a study showing adults who tested positive for COVID-19 were twice as likely to have said they dined at a restaurant than others. French scientists said the U.S. research confirmed their suspicions: After private homes, hospitality was an alarming vector for infection. 
People were not following safety guidelines properly, said Didier Lepelletier, co-chair of a COVID-19 working group of the High Council for Public Health, the main advisory body for the government, who helped draft the guidelines.
The day the CDC report came out, President Emmanuel Macron chaired a meeting of his COVID-19 taskforce. Health Minister Olivier Veran pressed for restaurants, bars and cafes to be shut down in Marseille and Bordeaux, cities where the virus was most rampant, according to two people briefed on the exchanges. 
Macron said no, telling Veran to concentrate on improving testing. He was worried about the economy and whether the French would accept the measures, said a lawmaker affiliated to his backers in parliament.
Macron's office declined to comment on the exchanges at the meeting, as did the health ministry spokesman. 
On Sept. 22, the Scientific Council issued a memo recommending bars and restaurants be closed if they could not follow tighter safety measures. 
The government ordered the closure of bars and restaurants in the Marseille region; those in Bordeaux stayed open.
TO ARMS
The hospitality business thought Paris could be next.
""We said to ourselves: we need to do something,"" said Stephane Manigold, owner of four Paris restaurants including one whose main course of sautéed squid, Iran lemon black butter, caramelized seeds and marinated squash has helped it earn a recommendation in Vogue magazine.
The industry started leveraging its influence.
Restaurant dinners and Zoom meetings were urgently convened so prominent figures could cook up an action plan, said Jacques Bally, former head of the Gault et Millau restaurant guide, who is in touch with many of the people involved. 
Lobby groups were joined by celebrity chefs including Philippe Etchebest, the French equivalent of TV chef Gordon Ramsay, and Alain Ducasse, who runs a three-Michelin-star restaurant at London's Dorchester hotel.
Under the banner ""We're staying open,"" the coalition organized street protests in Marseille and Paris. 
Helping their case, scientists representing a minority view published two open letters arguing that talk of a second wave was overblown.
Behind the scenes, Manigold was sending private messages to Bruno Le Maire, the finance and economy minister and an old acquaintance, on WhatsApp. 
He told Le Maire that state support for furloughed restaurant staff was less generous than the minister thought. The minister asked him to keep sending ""pertinent information,"" Manigold said. 
""Everyone goes to restaurants,"" said Manigold. ""Doctors and politicians are bon-viveurs."" Le Maire's ministry declined to comment, referring questions to the health ministry.
Le Maire's deputy, Griset, held 16 meetings about or with representatives of the hospitality sector between July 24 and Nov. 15, according to his official diary. That was more meetings than he held with representatives of any other economic sector over the period. 
Griset told Reuters that hospitality was one of the worst-hit areas, so it made sense to hear their views. He said public health never took a back seat to economic interests.
Macron was also involved. During this time he went for a meal – off his official schedule – at a restaurant in the sixth arrondissement of Paris where he used to eat before he was elected, according to an industry source. He talked to kitchen staff and bosses of that restaurant about their concerns, the source said. 
The presidential administration declined to comment.
URGENT MEETING
On Sept. 29, three days after the owner of ""Chez Francoise"" had texted Griset, France recorded just over 8,000 new COVID-19 cases, a decline from earlier in the month.
Griset's boss Le Maire and Prime Minister Jean Castex granted requests from associations representing the industry for an urgent meeting. On the agenda: the possible closure of all restaurants, bars and cafes across France, one person present told Reuters.
Industry delegates had a proposal. If they promised to stick to stricter guidelines for restaurants, could they stay open? The officials at the meeting decided to explore the proposal further.
The High Council for Public Health approved it and a week later, when new restrictions were announced, closing restaurants was not among them.
Asked to comment, the prime minister's office told Reuters the government had acted on the opinion of the High Council, adding that measures it had taken succeeded in containing the second wave, while limiting the damage to the economy. 
""The management of this crisis requires walking a tightrope between protecting public health and the protection of our economy. That is what the government does,"" the statement said.
Four weeks after that meeting, on Oct. 27, France's COVID-19 numbers had skyrocketed: 33,417 new cases and 148 new intensive care patients. A total of 523 deaths were recorded. 
The next day, Macron announced a nationwide lockdown including the closure of all restaurants and cafes. They will stay closed through Christmas and the New Year and not re-open until Jan. 20 at the earliest. 
In the high-stakes contest with France's restaurant and café industry, scientists had been at a disadvantage, said Yazdanpanah, the Scientific Council member. 

""We're not going to protest in the street.""

37,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",Women's movement sweeps Latin America to loosen abortion restrictions,"By Daina Beth Solomon and Cassandra Garrison
MEXICO CITY/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Several weeks pregnant and about to start a job away from home, Lupita Ruiz had no doubts about wanting to end her pregnancy, despite knowing she could face jail time for having an abortion under a law in her state of Chiapas in southern Mexico.     
    She asked friends for help until she found a doctor two hours from her town who agreed to do it in secret. 
    Five years later, lawmakers in Chiapas are set to consider an initiative to halt prosecutions of women who terminate their pregnancies, part of a movement sweeping Latin America to loosen some of the world's most restrictive abortion laws.
Several out of more than 20 Latin American nations ban abortion outright, including El Salvador, which has sentenced some women to up to 40 years in prison. Most countries, including Brazil, the region's most populous, allow abortion only in specific circumstances, such as rape or health risk to the mother. 
Just Uruguay and Cuba allow elective abortions. 
In Mexico, a patchwork of state restrictions apply, but the debate is shifting, Ruiz said. 
    ""When someone talked about abortion, they were shushed,"" said the 27-year-old activist, who helped draft the Chiapas initiative. ""Now I can sit down to eat a tamale and have a coffee and talk with my mom and my grandma about abortion, without anyone telling me to be quiet.""
Change is palpable across the predominantly Roman Catholic region. A new Argentine president proposed legalization last month, Chilean activists are aiming to write broader reproductive rights into a new constitution, and female lawmakers in Mexico are resisting abortion bans.     
The push can be traced to Argentina's pro-abortion protests in 2018 by as many as one million women to back a legalization bill that only narrowly failed to pass - in Pope Francis's home country.
Catalina Martinez, director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy organization, said Argentina's example inspired protests across Latin America. 
""It was an awakening,"" she said. 
Outrage at worsening gender violence in Latin America, where the number of femicides has doubled in five years, has also spread awareness of the abortion rights movement and fueled demands for recognition of women's rights in a conservative, male-dominated society. 
""Women are finally understanding that they are not separate issues,"" said Catalina Calderon, director for campaigns and advocacy programs at the Women's Equality Center. ""It's the fact that you agree that we women are in control of our bodies, our decisions, our lives."" 
The rise of social media has afforded women opportunities to bypass establishment-controlled media and bring attention to their stories, Calderon said.
""Now they're out there for the public to discuss and for the women to react, and say: 'This does not work. We need to do something',"" Calderon said. 
As in the United States, where conservatives have made gains in restricting a woman's right to an abortion, there is pushback in Latin America against the calls for greater liberalization.
Brazil, under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, is making it even harder for women to abort.
The Argentine Episcopal Conference has said it does not want to debate abortion during the coronavirus crisis, and alluded to comments by the Pope urging respect for those who are ""not yet useful,"" including fetuses.
    Yet trust in the Catholic Church, which believes life begins at conception, is fading, with many Latin Americans questioning its moral legitimacy because of sexual abuse by priests.
SPREADING 'GREEN WAVE'
Argentina could be first up for sweeping change, with a bill submitted to Congress by center-left President Alberto Fernandez seeking to legalize elective abortions.
    Approval for legalization has risen eight percentage points since 2014, according to an August Ipsos poll, with support split nearly evenly between those who favor elective abortion and those who are for it only in certain circumstances.
    ""The dilemma we must overcome is whether abortions are performed clandestinely or in the Argentine health system,"" Fernandez said.
According to the Guttmacher Institute, a U.S.-based reproductive health research organization, an estimated 29% of pregnancies in Latin America and the Caribbean from 2015 to 2019 ended in abortion, encompassing 5.4 million women. The abortions are often clandestine, so figures are hard to determine.
The mass demonstrations in Argentina two years ago, known as the ""green wave"" protests, have reverberated.
Since mid-2018, lawmakers in Mexico have filed more than 40 proposals to end punishment for abortion, according to Mexican reproductive rights group GIRE.    
    In Chiapas, the de-criminalization effort is the first of its kind since a brief period in the 1990s when abortion was legalized during the left-wing Zapatista rebellion. 
    Although Chiapas does not on paper punish abortion with prison, it can jail women for the ""killing"" of their infants.
    With Mexico's first leftist government in a century in power, national lawmakers are considering two initiatives to open up restrictions and strip away criminal punishments from places like Sonora state, where abortion can be punished by up to six years in prison.
Only two federal entities, Mexico City and Oaxaca, allow elective abortions.
    Wendy Briceno, a Sonoran lawmaker who has backed a nationwide legalization bill, said the initiatives have a good chance to pass if the debate centers on women's health, especially given rising outrage over femicides. 
    In Chile, activists are celebrating a vote in October to write a new constitution as a chance to expand a 2017 law that permitted abortion to save a mother's life, in cases of rape, or if the fetus is not viable.
    Colombia, where the constitutional court has agreed to consider a petition to remove abortion from the penal code, could set an example, said Anita Pena, director of Chilean reproductive rights group Corporacion Miles.
    Activists agree there is still a long way to go, with restrictive laws entrenched in many countries. 
    To Briceno, Brazil's shift to the right under Bolsonaro, who has vowed to veto any pro-abortion bills, was a reminder to push even harder for abortion rights.

    ""No fight is ever finished,"" she said.

Mornings used to reveal bright picture-postcard scenes of tourists from around the world stopping to buy souvenirs at Palestinian shops as they made their way to biblical sites holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians.
But a modern-day plague, the coronavirus pandemic, is now keeping the visitors away from the Old City and bringing hardship and heartbreak to residents.

A nationwide lockdown has meant thousands of Christmas trees may not get to market in time in a blow to farmers in an area of northern Greece where fir tree sales are their only livelihood.
""It will be a huge catastrophe,"" said Christos Bitsios, a fir farmer in Taxiarchis, a mountainous village in Greece's Chalkidiki region. 
Greece has extended to Dec. 7 a nationwide lockdown it imposed in November, its second since the coronavirus pandemic began, after a surge in COVID-19 cases. Northern Greece has been hit the hardest by the pandemic. 
This time last year, Christmas trees were up for sale, Bitsios said. The annual crop requires up to 15 years of labour and the trees must be cut annually or they dry out as they are densely planted, he said. 
Authorities say easing the restrictions would require a significant drop in COVID-19 cases which would ease pressure on the health system. 
Greece registered 1,044 cases on Monday, bringing the total to 105,271 infections since the pandemic began. 
Bitsios is optimistic that 2020 could be a year of high demand, if restrictions are eased, as people were more likely to stay home for Christmas. 
""If they allow us, if they open the retail sector, we may fare better than other years because people want to decorate a tree. We've received many calls, many orders,"" he said.
If not, the loss for the village is estimated at 300,000 euros ($360,000). Asked what he wants from Santa Claus this year, Bitsios said: ""Better luck next year"".

The man in his 40s was found in the apartment by a relative on Sunday in a wounded state, Stockholm prosecutor Emma Olsson told Reuters, saying he may have been held for nearly 30 years.
Various Swedish media, citing a relative who found him, said the man was discovered lying on a blanket on the floor, toothless, unable to speak, and covered in sores and injuries.
""He's now in hospital ... I know that he needed surgery,"" said Olsson, who gave no more details of his condition.
Expressen newspaper and others said the son was taken out of school aged about 12. He was found next to two almanacs from 1995 and 1996 on the wall in the apartment packed with clutter, the relative was also quoted as saying. 
The mother is denying charges of false imprisonment and grievous bodily harm, Olsson said in a statement. 
Neither have been named. 
There was no immediate explanation of why the son had been held. Reuters was unable to contact family members for comment.
Alerted to the case by hospital staff treating the man, police cordoned off the apartment in the southern Stockholm district of Haninge for investigations.

But the government promptly said the move, proposed in response to the assassination of a top nuclear scientist on Friday, could not change Iran's nuclear policy, which was the province of the Supreme National Security Council.
""Death to America! Death to Israel!"" some lawmakers chanted after the hardline-dominated parliament cleared the draft at its first reading in a session broadcast live on state radio.
Parliament has often demanded a hardening of Iran's position on the nuclear issue in recent years, without much success.
In this case, the government must decide whether a sharp response to Friday's killing of nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh might jeopardise the prospect of an improvement in ties with the United States once Joe Biden takes over from Donald Trump as president.
""The government believes that, under the constitution, the nuclear accord and the nuclear programme... are under the jurisdiction of the Supreme National Security Council... and parliament cannot deal with this by itself,"" government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters, according to state media. 
A senior Iranian official said on Monday that Tehran suspected a foreign-based opposition group of complicity with Israel in the killing of Fakhrizadeh, whom Western powers see as the architect of an abandoned Iranian nuclear weapons programme. The group rejected the accusation.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has declined to comment on the killing. Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi said on Saturday he did not know who had carried it out.
The bill still needs approval in a second reading and endorsement by a clerical body to become law.Iran has already breached the limits set in its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, who scrapped sanctions in return for curbs to Iran's nuclear programme, to protest at Trump's withdrawal from the accord.
The maximum fissile purity to which it has enriched uranium has remained around 4.5%, above the deal’s 3.67% cap but below the 20% Iran had achieved before, a relatively short step from weapons grade.

Biden has said he will return the United States to the 2015 deal if Iran resumes compliance. Iran has always denied pursuing nuclear weapons.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Papuans held rallies across at least eight cities in Indonesia on Tuesday to renew calls for independence, as a separatist group declared it had established a provisional government in exile.
The demonstrations marked the anniversary of West Papua declaring independence from Dutch rule in 1961, which was followed by a contentious U.N.-sanctioned referendum in 1969 that brought Papua under Indonesian control.
Among more than 100 students who marched in the capital Jakarta, Papuan Roland Levy said the date remained significant decades on. 
""My goal in joining the rally today is to commemorate 59 years of the proclamation of independence of the West Papuan nation that was annexed by Indonesia,"" he told Reuters, as demonstrators waved banners calling for the right to self-determination. 
Some Papuans regard the 1969 plebiscite as unfair and say intimidation was used to influence the outcome, which Jakarta has rejected. 
The protests coincided with a declaration from the United Liberation Movement for West Papua that a provisional ""government-in-waiting"" had been formed, led by exiled independence figure, Benny Wenda.
Britain-based Wenda said the group would push for independence and no longer ""bow down to Jakarta's illegal martial rule"". 
Teuku Faizasyah, a spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry, paid little heed to what he described as ""Mr. Wenda's self-proclaimed status"".
""The status of Papua as part of Indonesia, the successor state of the Netherlands (Dutch) East Indies, is final,"" he said, referring to the former colonial power. 
He said the integration process was supervised by the United Nations and included the adoption of a resolution.
Papua has been plagued by separatist conflict for decades and access for foreign journalists is often restricted. 
In the past year there have been sporadic and deadly attacks involving security forces and indigenous Papuans, including the killing of several Papuan minors and a pastor in recent months.
The United Nations human rights body on Monday expressed concern over reports of extrajudicial killings and escalating violence in the region.

""But it remains true, and we have always said, that the cold winter months, in which we spend more time indoors, will be the harder part. That actually applies until the end of winter,"" Jens Spahn told public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.
German authorities are preparing special vaccination centres due to be ready in mid-December even though a vaccine will probably not be available by that time, Spahn added.
Health workers will vaccinate people with mobile teams and at vaccination centres since a candidate developed by Biontech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius, Spahn said. 
He added that he expects more vaccines, which can be administered by general practitioners, in spring or early summer. ""Once (the vaccines) are in the normal system, we can manage big numbers,"" he said.
Spahn last month said he expects Germany will get up to 100 million doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine alone.
Nurses, doctors, and sick and old people - who have a higher risk of serious infection - will likely get the vaccine first.
Germany was widely praised for its response to the first coronavirus wave in spring, but numbers now are stubbornly high despite new distancing measures introduced early last month.
Schools remain open but from Tuesday, private gatherings are limited to five people, and fewer people are allowed in shops.
The official case tally rose by 13,604 on Tuesday to 1,067,473, while deaths were up 388 to 16,636. 

""I'm not satisfied at all. The numbers have to go down. There's no doubt about that,"" Spahn said, asking Germans to further reduce their contacts to curb the spread.

Local media said 40 workers had been laid off from i-Cable, including the entire team from the station's award-winning investigative section News Lancet. 
""In the face of daunting challenges, the group has devoted to adopting various measures to explore new business opportunities for competitiveness enhancement and sustainable development,"" the station said in a statement, adding that about 100 positions of the group's 1,300 staff would be affected. 
""Under this circumstance, after a comprehensive review, it was unavoidable for the group to carry out an organizational restructure of various departments.""
The pay TV station did not say how many had been sacked.
Wong Lai-ping, deputy chief of the station's China News team, which covers human rights on the mainland and reported from Wuhan province on the coronavirus outbreak, told reporters she was among those laid off. Ten other members of the team had resigned in protest against the lay-offs, she added.
i-Cable journalists told Reuters the lay-offs had prompted the heads of the station's China News, Hong Kong General News, Finance News and Editing desk to resign. 
Yau Ting-leung, 22, a journalist from the News Lancet segment who said he was fired after about six months with the company, said he was sceptical of the reason behind the decision.
""It's definitely media censorship. It's a pity they sacked the entire team. There aren't many TV investigative news programmes in Hong Kong,"" Yau said.
i-Cable told Reuters it had no comment when asked about reports of censorship. 
The Hong Kong Journalists' Association said it was watching the situation closely as media have already come under pressure in the wake of a new national security law introduced by Beijing on its freest city on June 30.
""This time the whole 'News Lancet' team of Cable News was laid off and the team has often reported against/on the police or the regime in the past year,"" HKJA said in a statement.

i-Cable was founded in 1993 and is now owned by David Chiu, chairman and CEO of Far East Consortium.

Swastikas were among the Nazi symbols uncovered in searches of the homes of 11 members of the group in the states of Hesse, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and North Rhine-Westphalia in the early hours of Tuesday, the interior ministry said in a statement.
""There is no place in our country for a group that sows hate and propagates the re-establishment of a Nazi state,"" Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said. 
Members of the ""Wolf Brigade"" openly pledge allegiance to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and seek to end the democratic state, while propagating racism and anti-Semitism, the ministry said.
The government also banned the symbols of the group, such as a skull with two grenades marked with the number 44.
In Nazi code, the four stands for the letter D as the fourth letter in the alphabet, the number 44 being an abbreviation for the so-called ""Division Dirlewanger"".

This alludes to a unit of the Nazi's paramilitary SS during World War Two that was particularly brutal and bore the name of Oskar Dirlewanger, who is accused of ordering massacres against civilians in Belarus in the 1940s.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Mitree Chitinunda was such a devoted Thai royalist that he had the king's portrait cut into his hair last year, but politics like fashion and hairstyles is changing in Thailand.
Mitree latest hairstyle shows the ""Hunger Games"" salute of the pro-democracy protesters who are demanding reforms to curb the power of King Maha Vajiralongkorn in addition to a new prime minister and new constitution.
""I support all of the three demands,"" said Mitree, 48, who regularly joins the protests.
""The protests happened because people had enough,"" he told Reuters. ""If we don't get real democracy, we will not stop and I will continue to support and come to protest.""
Mitree's change of heart reflects the dramatic transformation in a country where reverence for the monarch is obligatory under the constitution, but tens of thousands of people have joined protests to demand royal reforms.
The government and royalist groups say loyalists remain in the majority, but there are no accurate opinion polls and protests that began in July have shown the strength of demands for change.
At first youth protests sought only to remove Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, but then broke taboos by calling for changes to the palace.
Protesters say they do not seek to end the monarchy, but to make the king accountable under the constitution, to reverse moves that gave the king greater powers and to reduce palace spending.
    ""The king is spending people's tax in the wrong way. That's why we need to reform the monarchy, but it doesn't mean getting rid of the institution because we all love the king,"" Mitree said.
Asked about the protesters recently, the king said they were loved ""all the same"". The palace itself has made no comment.
Mitree, a radiologist, had been a passionate royalist for decades, growing up in a country where the monarchy is promoted from schools to television to the giant portraits on streets.
But he said his mind was changed when he found out more.
    ""I have received a lot of information via the internet, television or YouTube channels and weighed whether it's true and it turns out it's true,"" he said. 
Warong Dechgitvigrom, leader of royalist group ""Thai Pakdee"" said some people were being misled by social media, but he believes most Thais support the monarchy.
""I'm not worried about people who are changing sides that much because I believe 80-90% of information on social media is fake,"" he said.
Mitree is known for his novelty haircuts, which he says help to put patients at ease. The three-fingered salute of the protesters is on the back of his head while a peace symbol is on the left and dove on the right.

""I have to be a bit more careful wherever I'm going because some ultra-royalist people are ignorant, they don't accept the truth,"" he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - China's embassy in Australia said politicians there had ""misread"" a tweet showing a digitally-altered image of an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child, and were trying to stoke nationalism.
Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called the tweet posted by China's foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, ""truly repugnant"", and called for an apology.
On Tuesday the tweet was pinned to the top of Zhao's social media account, and China's Global Times newspaper, known for nationalistic views, interviewed the Chinese artist who created the image.
""The rage and roar of some Australian politicians and media is nothing but misreading of and overreaction to Mr Zhao's tweet,"" the Chinese embassy in Canberra said in a statement on Tuesday.
Australia's Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary had called ambassador Cheng Jingye on Monday to complain about the social media post, it confirmed, adding that Cheng had ""refuted the unwarranted accusations as absolutely unacceptable"".
Australia was seeking to ""stoke domestic nationalism"", and ""deflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers"", it said.
New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said earlier on Tuesday that New Zealand has registered its concern with Chinese authorities over the use of the ""unfactual"" image of the soldier.
An independent investigation into allegations of war crimes by Australian special forces in Afghanistan found 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians were killed, and Australia has said 19 soldiers will be referred for potential criminal prosecution. 
Morrison apologised to Afghan president Ashraf Ghani before the public release of the investigation report a fortnight ago. 
The inflammatory tweet came just days after China effectively blocked an A$1.2 billion ($883.44 million) wine export industry by imposing dumping tariffs of up to 200% on Australian wine.
Australia has said there looks to be a pattern of Chinese trade sanctions against Australian products this year, linked to Beijing's diplomatic grievances over Australia's national security, human rights and foreign policy decisions.

Operations targeting the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen have continued under a four-year-long crackdown since the attempted coup in July 2016. Gulen denies involvement in the putsch attempt, in which some 250 people were killed.
Tuesday's operation was spread over 39 provinces and 63 people have already been detained, Anadolu said. Of the suspects, 70 were on active duty. 
The detentions were ordered by the chief prosecutor in the western coastal province of Izmir, Anadolu said, adding that it also took steps to sack 848 military personnel, including high ranking officers, over links to the network. 
Since the coup attempt, about 80,000 people have been held pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended. More than 20,000 people had been expelled from the Turkish military alone.
Last week, a Turkish court sentenced leaders of the attempted coup to life in jail, convicting hundreds of army officers, pilots and civilians over the failed bid to topple President Tayyip Erdogan.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government invited protesting farmers for talks on Tuesday, seeking to allay concerns about new laws growers fear could pave the way for the government to stop buying grain at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers.
In a letter addressed to 32 farmers' unions, Sanjay Agrawal, the most senior civil servant at the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, urged farmers to come forward for talks with government ministers and officials.
The government had earlier invited farmers for talks on Thursday but agreed to meet on Tuesday due to cold weather and the coronavirus pandemic, Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.
The protests have intensified since last week when farmers arrived in trucks, buses and tractors at Delhi's Singhu border with Haryana state and blocked the main northern highway into the capital.
Earlier, an umbrella group representing different farmers' unions slammed the government for saying it would engage in talks with the farmers if they moved their protest off the roads into a designated stadium site.
If the government is serious about addressing the demands of farmers, it should stop laying down conditions, they said.
Small growers fear the new laws will make them vulnerable to competition from big business, and that they could eventually lose price supports for staples such as wheat and rice.
On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi resisted calls for the repeal of farm reforms, saying growers were being misled and that new laws would benefit them.

India's vast farm sector contributes nearly 15% of the country's $2.9 trillion economy and employs around half its 1.3 billion people.

    The term had the most online dictionary lookups of any word, Merriam-Webster said on its website, after a year in which at least 1.4 million people globally have died from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Sometimes a single word defines an era, and it's fitting that in this exceptional - and exceptionally difficult - year, a single word came immediately to the fore,"" the dictionary publisher said.
    Pandemic is defined as ""an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area (such as multiple countries or continents) and typically affects a significant proportion of the population,"" according to Merriam-Webster.com.
    The word’s Greek roots are “pan,” meaning all or every and “demos,” meaning people, Merriam-Webster said.
    Dictionary lookups skyrocketed on March 11 when the World Health Organization officially labeled COVID-19 a pandemic. 
The word ""saw the single largest spike in dictionary traffic in 2020, showing an increase of 115,806% over lookups on that day in 2019,"" said the company, founded in 1831.

Last year's winner was ""they"" as used to describe someone who does not identify as male nor female. That follows winners ""justice"" in 2018, ""feminism"" in 2017 and ""surreal"" in 2016.

While temporary, the measures - which take effect from Tuesday - are a liberalisation of labour curbs on foreigners in an aging economy suffering from huge shortages of workers but where the ruling party has been reluctant to embrace a full-fledged immigration reform.
A number of foreigners in Japan, either as students or on other visa statuses, have been stuck in Japan longer than expected due to the coronavirus pandemic as a result of things such as strict quarantine rules in their home nations or a lack of plane flights, leaving some without financial support.
The new rules will allow people with 90 day short-stay permits to renew their permits and receive permission to work up to 28 hours a week, while technical trainees will be able to change their visas to a ""specified activity"" work permit for six months, the Justice Ministry said on its website.
People on student visas will be able to work for up to 28 hours a week even if they are no longer students.
An immigration bureau official told Reuters news of the measures would be spread on social media and their duration would ""depend on the situation.""
About 21,000 foreigners in Japan may be eligible, NHK public broadcasting said.
Labour activists said the measures fell short.
""It's better than nothing, but these people will not be eligible for either health insurance or welfare support. If they can find jobs that's one thing, but it's really insufficient for those who can't,"" said Koichi Kodama, a lawyer with expertise in foreign labour issues. 

""If they wanted to do it right, they should grant them permanent resident status.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A few hundred people marched in central Mexico City on Monday to protest the killing of a French businessman and his Mexican colleague over the weekend, the latest violent crime to inflame concerns about security in the country.
The demonstrators marched along a main thoroughfare of the wealthy western neighborhood of Polanco to a restaurant run by Baptiste Lormand, 45, and his business partner, Luis Orozco, before leaving flowers outside the French embassy nearby.
Local residents and business owners took part, with one protester holding up a placard reading in Spanish: ""When there's no justice, the authorities become accomplices.""
Lormand and Orozco were reported missing on Friday and their bodies found by a dirt road in a southern district of the capital on Saturday, Mexico City prosecutors said.
Polanco resident Israel Reyes said he was deeply saddened by the killing and shocked that such a crime had occurred in an area generally deemed to be among the safest in the city.
""I think there's now a great responsibility on society and the authorities for us to restore order,"" Reyes said.
Mexico City police chief Omar Harfuch, who was the target of an assassination attempt near Polanco five months ago, said a man believed to have been involved in the killings had been arrested on Monday.
Harfuch said investigators suspected robbery was behind the crime, although some at the march said the Frenchman and his partner were victims of extortion.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office two years ago pledging to reduce record levels of gang-fueled violence. Instead, the bloodshed has only increased.

Murders hit another record in 2019, and are on track to surpass that mark this year, official data show.

(Reuters) - Families of 15 public school students sued California on Monday, claiming the state has failed to provide equal education to poor and minority children during the pandemic.
The impoverished students, who range from kindergarten to high school and were only identified by first name in court documents, were not provided devices and internet connections to attend online classes, according to the lawsuit, the first of its kind in the United States. 
The children attend schools in Oakland and Los Angeles, and many were described as Blacks and Latinos. The lawsuit also claims that schools did not meet academic and mental health support needs, English language barriers and the unmet needs of homeless students.
The suit, filed in Alameda County Superior Court, is asking the court to declare that California education officials have violated the state constitution's guarantee of educational equality and order them to fix the alleged inequities.
U.S. schools districts including those in California, the most populous state in the nation, closed school buildings and moved classes online in March as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic surged. Since then, many districts, especially in urban areas, have struggled to meet the needs of students, especially disadvantaged students. 
""The change in the delivery of education left many already-underserved students functionally unable to attend school. The State continues to refuse to step up and meet its constitutional obligation to ensure basic educational equality or indeed any education at all,"" the suit said. 
The state's department of education did not respond immediately to a request for comment. 
One of the lawyers for the families, Mark Rosenbaum, said the lawsuit was the first case in the nation against a state for failure to meet the educational needs of students during the pandemic.

A similar lawsuit was filed against the Los Angeles Unified School District in September, accusing the second-largest school district in the United States of failing to provide a basic education to Black and Latino students during the pandemic, the Los Angeles Times reported.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said on Tuesday that her government has raised concerns with China about its using an image of an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child.
Australia has demanded Beijing apologise and take down the fake image, posted on Twitter by a senior Chinese official on Monday, marking another downturn in deteriorating relations between the two countries.
""New Zealand has registered directly with Chinese authorities our concern over the use of that image,"" Ardern told reporters in the parliament in the capital Wellington. 
""It was an unfactual post, and of course that would concern us. So that is something we have raised directly in the manner that New Zealand does when we have such concerns.""
The tiny, trade-focused Pacific island nation has stayed clear of the growing feud between China and Australia, and has long-standing diplomatic, trade and political interests with both countries.
New Zealand has a shared history, close cultural ties, geographic proximity and a strong economic relation with Australia. China is its largest trading partner, with two-way trade exceeding NZ$33 billion. 
New Zealand, which is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group with Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States, joined a statement calling on Beijing to reverse its decision to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong.
Ardern's government also backed Taiwan's participation at the World Health Organization (WHO) despite a warning from Beijing.
New Zealand will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) next year, taking over from Malaysia, where the global event was held this year. 
Australia's relationship with China has deteriorated since Canberra called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.

PARIS (Reuters) -French President Emmanuel Macron's ruling party agreed on Monday to completely rewrite a draft plan that would have curbed the freedom to share images identifying police officers, after large protests over the weekend against police violence.
More than 133,000 people, including 46,000 in Paris alone, demonstrated against the draft bill and in favour of free speech on Saturday.
The rallies followed the publication of video footage of a Black man being beaten up by three police officers inside his own music studio earlier this month that Macron has branded ""shameful"" for France.
A provision in the draft law known as article 24, a key plank in Macron's plans to court right-wing voters by being tougher on law and order ahead of his 2022 re-election bid, had sparked outrage in the media and on the left of his own party. 
""We propose a new version of article 24 and a new version will be submitted,"" Christophe Castaner, head of Macron's Republic on the Move (LaRem) party in the lower house of parliament, told a news conference.
Article 24 did not ban outright the sharing of images of the police, but made it a crime - punishable by a year in prison and a 45,000 euro ($54,000) fine - to share them with an ""obvious intention to harm"".
""DOUBTS""
French journalists and even the government's own independent ombudsman on human rights said the article was too vague and could have a chilling effect on people wanting to expose police brutality. 
The footage showing the violent arrest of Michel Zecler in his studio, which prompted international criticism, made it even less tenable for Macron to press on with article 24, French officials said. 
""We acknowledge that there are doubts, that some people consider that the right to inform is under threat... That is why it is necessary to clarify it,"" Castaner said. 
His statement came after Macron held an emergency meeting on the bill at the Elysee palace earlier on Monday with leaders of his parliamentary majority and his tough-talking interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, a former conservative.
Many of Macron's more centre-left followers have expressed dismay at what they see as the president's ""conservative turn"" in recent months. 
The stated aim of the broader ""general security"" bill is to provide better protection for French police officers, whose unions said were under heavy strain after months of violent ""yellow vest"" protests. 
A new version of article 24 will be submitted at a later date, officials said, although it remained unclear when, since the bill, approved last week by the lower house, has now been sent to the upper house, where the conservatives, and not Macron's party, have a majority.

The nearly month-long war has killed hundreds and probably thousands of people, sent refugees into Sudan, enmeshed Eritrea, and stirred rivalries among Ethiopia's myriad ethnic groups.
Federal forces captured regional capital Mekelle at the weekend and declared victory over the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a guerrilla movement-turned-political party that dominated national government for nearly three decades until 2018.
""Our constitution was attacked but it didn't take us three years, it took us three weeks,"" Abiy told parliament, comparing his offensive with the American Civil War of the 1860s.
""Our army is disciplined and victorious."" 
Though the TPLF said Mekelle had been bombarded, Abiy said his troops had not used rockets and had not killed a single civilian in Tigray since starting an offensive in response to an attack on an army base on Nov. 4.
Though the highland city of 500,000 people eventually fell with little resistance, the TPLF said on Sunday it had shot down a plane and retaken one town.
The United States expressed concern about continued fighting and called for a complete end to hostilities and for dialogue. Both Washington and the United Nations urged that human rights be fully respected and that aid groups be allowed access.

'FIGHTING THE INVADERS'
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael denied reports he had fled to South Sudan and said his forces captured some soldiers from neighbouring Eritrea around Wukro, about 50 km (30 miles) north of Mekelle.
""I'm close to Mekelle in Tigray fighting the invaders,"" he told Reuters in a text message.
Claims from all sides are difficult to verify as phone and internet links to Tigray have largely been down and access is restricted.
The TPLF has shelled Asmara's airport and accused Eritrea of sending troops to fight with Abiy's forces. Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied that accusation. 
When he took office in 2018, Abiy pledged to unite Ethiopia's 115 million people, but ethnic bloodshed had killed hundreds and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes even before the latest flare-up. 
In Tigray, both sides have spoken of hundreds of fatalities in air strikes and fighting. Diplomats believe the toll is in the thousands. 
Abiy's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum dismissed the TPLF's comments that fighting continued, dismissing them as the delusions of a disintegrating criminal clique"".
Redwan Hussein, head of a government taskforce on Tigray, told Reuters most casualties occurred at the start of the conflict during a TPLF attack on Ethiopian soldiers, attempts by reinforcements to reach them, and then a mass killing of about 700 civilians.
""Our orders were to leave the cities alone, and to encircle them, to cut the forces that were within the towns from their chain of commands,"" he added, saying the Republican Guard captured Mekelle without shooting as TPLF conscripts deserted.
The TPLF was not immediately available to comment. On Sunday, the Red Cross said Mekelle's hospitals were low on supplies and bodybags, but did not give casualty figures.

GUERRILLA WAR?
It is not clear how many fighters the TPLF has left, but Debretsion's defiance raises the spectre of a drawn-out insurgency. The battle-hardened TPLF helped topple Ethiopia's Marxist dictatorship in 1991 and knows how to exploit its mountains and borders with Sudan and Eritrea.
Abiy, whose parents are from the larger Oromo and Amharic groups, said he had felt Ethiopia's ethnic frictions even when taking office as prime minister, where he felt like a ""prisoner."" He said security services dominated by Tigrayans discouraged him from travelling round Ethiopia.
There are more than 80 ethnicities in Ethiopia, which operates as a federation of 10 regions run by separate groups.
Abiy said he had directed reforms to reduce Tigrayans in senior military positions from more than 60% to a quarter of the top brass. Tigrayans make up roughly 6% of the population. 
Though urging the more than 45,000 refugees in Sudan to return, Abiy said it was suspicious so many of them were young males and if any had a role in an alleged massacre of non-Tigrayans in Mai Kadra they should face justice.
The government blamed the killings on a Tigrayan youth group with the aid of local forces, but the TPLF denied any collusion. 
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN
Despite the government's claim of victory, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo voiced grave concern about the hostilities. In a telephone call with Abiy, Pompeo called for dialogue and a complete end to the fighting, a State Department spokesman said.
He stressed the importance of protecting civilians, including refugees fleeing into Sudan, and giving international humanitarian organizations access to Tigray, the State Department said.
He urged the government to respect the human rights of Tigrayans and all ethnic groups.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke with Abiy on Sunday and called for full respect for human rights and access for humanitarian aid, a U.N. spokesman said.

""The Secretary General also said that Ethiopia needed a true reconciliation, without discrimination...where every community should feel respected and be part of Ethiopia,"" he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - China's efforts to win an international certification for Pao Cai, a pickled vegetable dish from Sichuan, is turning into a social media showdown between Chinese and South Korean netizens over the origin of Kimchi, a staple Korean cuisine made of cabbage.
Beijing recently won a certification from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for Pao Cai, an achievement the state-run Global Times reported as ""an international standard for the Kimchi industry led by China.""
South Korean media was fast to dispute such a claim and accuse the bigger neighbour of trying to make Kimchi a type of China-made Pao Cai.
The episode triggered anger on South Korean social media.
""Its total nonsense, what a thief stealing our culture!"" a South Korean netizen wrote on Naver.com, a widely popular web portal.
""I read a media story that China now says Kimchi is theirs, and that they are making international standard for it, It's absurd. I'm worried that they might steal Hanbok and other cultural contents, not just Kimchi,"" said Kim Seol-ha, a 28-year old in Seoul.
Some South Korean media even described the episode as China's ""bid for world domination,"" while some social media comments flagged concerns that Beijing was exercising ""economic coercison.""
On China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Chinese netizens were claiming Kimchi as their country's own traditional dish, as most of Kimchi consumed in South Korea is made in China.
“Well, if you don’t meet the standard, then you’re not kimchi,"" one wrote on Weibo. ""Even the pronunciation of kimchi originated from Chinese, what else is there to say,"" wrote another.
South Korea's agriculture ministry on Sunday released a statement saying mainly that the ISO approved standard does not apply to Kimchi.

""It is inappropriate to report (about Pao Cai winning the ISO) without differentiating Kimchi from Pao Cai of China's Sichuan,"" the statement said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia agreed on Monday to let Israeli airliners cross its airspace en route to the United Arab Emirates after talks between Saudi officials and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, a senior Trump administration official said.
Kushner and Middle East envoys Avi Berkowitz and Brian Hook raised the issue shortly after they arrived in Saudi Arabia for talks. ""We were able to reconcile the issue,"" the official told Reuters.
The agreement was hammered out just hours before Israel's first commercial flight to the UAE was planned on Tuesday morning. The Israir flight was at risk of being canceled with no overflight agreement.
The direct flights are an offshoot of normalization deals Israel reached this year with the UAE, Bahrain and Sudan.
""This should resolve any issues that should occur with Israeli carriers taking people from Israel to the UAE and back and to Bahrain,"" the official said.

Kushner and his team were to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman later this week, as well as the emir of Kuwait. One goal of the trip is to try to persuade Gulf Cooperation Council countries to end a three-year blockade of Qatar.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",Conservative justices wary of blocking Trump immigrant census plan,"By Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared reluctant to block a vaguely defined plan by President Donald Trump's administration to exclude immigrants living in the United States illegally from the population totals used to allocate congressional districts to states.
The court's conservatives, who hold a 6-3 majority, signaled such a ruling might be premature based on the administration's admission that it does not yet know how or if it will be able to implement the proposal, a facet of Trump's hardline policies on immigration being pursued in his final weeks in office.
Challengers led by New York state and the American Civil Liberties Union have argued that Trump's proposal would dilute the political clout of states with larger numbers of such immigrants, including heavily Democratic California, by undercounting state populations and depriving them of House seats to the benefit of his fellow Republicans. 
The administration has yet to disclose what method it would use to calculate the number of people it proposes to exclude or which subsets of immigrants may be targeted. Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall told the justices the administration could miss a Dec. 31 statutory deadline to finalize a Census Bureau report to Trump containing the final population data including the number of immigrants excluded.
The number of House districts in the 50 states is based on a state's population count in the decennial national census, which was conducted this year. Democrat Joe Biden is set to become president on Jan. 20 and could reverse course if the apportionment numbers have not been finalized by then.
""We don't know what the president is going to do,"" conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said. ""We don't know how many aliens will be excluded. We don't know what the effect of that will be on apportionment. All these questions would be resolved if we wait until the apportionment takes place. Why aren't we better advised to do that?"" 
The U.S. Constitution requires apportionment of House seats to be based upon the ""whole number of persons in each state."" Until now, the government's practice was to count all people regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. 
The justices were expected to decide the case on a expedited basis, with a ruling before the end of the year. The court potentially could dismiss the current legal challenge, a move that would leave open the possibility of subsequent lawsuits after the administration actually takes action.
Lawyers for the challengers urged the court not to toss out the lawsuit now, asking the justices to wait for a few weeks until more information is available on what data the Census Bureau intends to submit to the president.
There are an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally. The challengers have argued that Trump's policy violates both the Constitution and the Census Act, a federal law that outlines how the census is conducted. 
The justices focused less on the underlying question of whether Trump's plan was lawful but conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, noted that the government during the entire history of the United States has included illegal immigrants in the population count.
""A lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position,"" Barrett told Wall.
Barrett also challenged Wall on the administration's position that an immigrant in the country illegally cannot be considered an inhabitant for the purposes of House apportionment. 
CERTAIN GROUPS MAY BE TARGETED
By statute, the president is required to send Congress a report in early January with the population of each of the states and their entitled number of House districts. 
Wall told the justices that it is ""very unlikely"" the administration will amass data to exclude all immigrants in the country illegally. Instead, Wall said, it may propose excluding certain groups, such as the fewer than 100,000 in federal detention, and the total number may not be high enough to affect apportionment.
The administration's lack of detail on whether it could implement Trump's plan prompted justices including Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to wonder if was premature to rule on the issue because the harm alleged by the challengers is speculative.
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito said that for the administration to exclude all of the immigrants living illegally in the United States from the population count ""seems to me a monumental task.""
""I would think you would be able to tell us whether that remains a realistic possibility at this point,"" Alito told Wall.
The challengers have argued that Trump's plan could leave several million people uncounted and cause California, Texas and New Jersey to lose House seats. 

A three-judge panel in New York ruled against the administration in September.

They could not confirm the identity of the commander, who they said was killed alongside three other men travelling in a vehicle with him.
The vehicle was carrying weapons across the Iraqi border and was hit after it had entered Syrian territory, two Iraqi security officials separately said.
Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups helped retrieve the bodies, the two officials said, without elaborating or giving the exact time of the incident.
Local military and militia sources confirmed the account, although Reuters was unable to verify independently that an Iranian commander had been killed.
The incident came just days after Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was assassinated in Tehran in a killing that Iran has blamed on Israel.
Israel launched air raids against what it called a wide range of Syrian and Iranian targets in Syria last week, signalling that it will pursue its policy of striking Iranian targets in the region as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to leave office.
Iraqi officials fear a conflagration ahead of President-elect Joe Biden taking office because he is viewed as less confrontational with Iran than the Trump administration.
Iran-backed Iraqi militias are still reeling from the U.S. assassination of Iranian military mastermind Qassem Soleimani in January and their Iraqi leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and have vowed revenge against the United States.

In an implicit rebuke to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who last week accused the European Parliament of adding a stipulation that payment of EU funds can be frozen if recipient countries do not reach minimum rule of law standards, Merkel said this had been the intention from the very beginning.

BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - NATO must think harder about how to handle China and its military rise, though Russia will remain its main adversary during this decade, according to a report to be published on Tuesday on reforming the Atlantic alliance.
The report ""NATO 2030"", prepared by a group of so-called 'wise persons' and containing 138 proposals, comes amid growing doubts about the purpose and relevance of an alliance branded last year by French President Emmanuel Macron as ""brain dead"".
""China is no longer the benign trading partner that the West had hoped for. It is the rising power of our century and NATO must adapt,"" said one NATO diplomat who has seen the report, pointing to Chinese activity in the Arctic and Africa and to its heavy investments in European infrastructure.
Part of NATO's response should be maintaining a technological advantage over China, protecting computer networks and infrastructure, the diplomat said, citing the report, although not all recommendations will be adopted. 
The 30-member alliance could also forge closer ties with non-NATO countries such as Australia and focus more on deterrence in space, where China is developing assets, the report suggests.
In comments on Monday ahead of the report's publication, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China's rise posed ""important challenges to our security"". 
""China is investing massively in new weapons. It is coming closer to us, from the Arctic to Africa. China does not share our values ... and tries to intimidate other countries,"" he told a news conference, urging allies to come together on the issue.
NATO should consider including China in NATO's official master strategy document, its ""Strategic Concept"", diplomats cited the report as saying, though it will stop short of declaring the country an adversary. 
TENSIONS
In other recommendations, the report will suggest that NATO foreign ministers meet more regularly and will call for a strengthening of the secretary-general's role as an international mediator.
The report will be discussed by NATO foreign ministers on Tuesday before being presented to the alliance's heads of state and government next year.
Even as U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' era comes to an end and Europeans welcome the election of an Atlanticist president-elect in Joe Biden, tensions over NATO's ability to act remain.
From anger over Turkey's decision to buy a Russian weapons system to U.S. doubts over Europe's commitment to its own defence, NATO - founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union - has also faced calls from Trump to do more in the Middle East. 

However, Eastern European allies, fearful of Russia since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, are concerned about shifting too many resources away from NATO's core task of defending Europe.

In a video address, the president said the attack on Friday in a region riven by bloody, sectarian conflict in the past was designed to drive a wedge among the population in the world's biggest majority-Muslim nation. 
""That gross act had the purpose of provoking and terrorising the people. They wanted to destroy the unity and brotherhood of our people,"" he said.
""We need to stay united in the fight against terrorism.""
Those killed in the Sigi region of central Sulawesi on Friday all were Christians, a church group and human rights activists said. The government has made no mention of their religion. 
One of the victims was beheaded and the other three had their throats slit, according to National police spokesman Awi Setiyono. 
Their homes and place of worship were set ablaze, he said, but reiterated the murders were not about religion. 
Authorities believe the militant Islamist group, Mujahidin Indonesia Timur (MIT), perpetrated the attack. There was no claim of responsibility. 
Central Sulawesi was a flashpoint of sectarian violence between Muslims and Christians in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which resulted in hundreds of deaths. 
More than 100 military and police have been deployed to the area since Friday's killings and military chief, Hadi Tjahjanto, said special forces would be mobilised. 
""I'm sure the MIT who perpetrated this crime on innocent residents will soon be captured,"" he said.
Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told Reuters that eleven farmers had been killed in the same area this year. 
Separately on Monday, Indonesian police announced they had arrested suspected bomb-maker Upik Lawanga, from the militant group, Jemaah Islamiyah.

Lawanga is suspected of making a bomb that killed more than 20 people in 2005 at a market in Poso, also central Sulawesi.

PARIS/BRUSSELS/MADRID (Reuters) - NATO has asked members for more money to finance a salary hike for staff, a request some alliance nations deem disproportionate given the COVID-19 hit to their economies and are refusing, three European diplomats said.
The proposed rise of about 2.2% would be the biggest in four years and comes as the Western military alliance looks to seal its budget for 2021 and European economies face their biggest contraction since the Second World War.
The moves adds to tensions within the 30 country alliance that stem from President Donald Trump accusing European allies of taking U.S. protection for granted and its image worsening after French President Emmanuel Macron said last year the organisation was experiencing ""brain death"".
""There's an economic crisis because of the pandemic and they are asking for cash for an institution where the lowest salaries are 4,000 euros. It's a joke,"" said one European diplomat aware of the matter. ""Asking states to increase contributions to pay for salaries during COVID-19 is irresponsible.""
Governments across Europe will be looking to rein in costs to help finance COVID-19 recovery packages, such as Britain saying it will pause public sector pay rises.
The salary burden also falls harder on NATO’s European allies this year. In November 2019 budget negotiations, Europe, Turkey and Canada agreed to carry more of the annual, $2.5 billion budget of running the headquarters, international staff and military assets under NATO command, in a gesture to Trump.
Some 1,000 civilians work within NATO’s international staff, which is composed solely of nationals from NATO member countries. They provide advice, guidance and administrative support to the national delegations at NATO Headquarters.
NATO declined to comment in detail on the negotiations.
""NATO salaries are subject to annual adjustment, based on a methodology agreed by all nations. Adjustments reflect national civil service salary adjustments. This is done in coordination with other international organisations such as the OECD, the Council of Europe and the European Space Agency,"" a NATO official said in response to Reuters questions.
""DETACHED FROM REALITY""
According to the first European diplomat, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called the Spanish and Italian foreign ministers on Nov. 27 to discuss the issue and was met with a rebuttal of the proposition.
Spain's Foreign Ministry confirmed the conversation but not the content ""out of respect for diplomatic relations"". Italian officials declined to comment.
A second European diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the matter said that in the conversation with Stoltenberg, Spain rejected the idea of increasing NATO salaries due to the current social context. 
""They (NATO) are detached from reality?. It's quite shocking during COVID given the size of salaries and other international organisations don't do this,"" said a third European diplomat.
According to a Pew Research Center poll last year, Spain is among countries whose citizens have a less favourable view of NATO.
Two NATO diplomats confirmed salary negotiations were under way and that there was unhappiness. They said that all members would have to pay because they had already agreed the overall methodology for salaries.

According to the NATO website the salary is adjusted once a year on Jan. 1 at the time of the annual NATO salary review.

UM RAKUBA CAMP, Sudan (Reuters) - Ethiopian farmer Berhan Halie came to Sudan 35 years ago to escape hunger. 
Now 65 and walking with a stick, he is back again, this time to escape the bullets and bombs of the conflict in Tigray, fleeing from his village as neighbours lay dead on the ground.
Berhan and his family spent days walking to the border crossing with Sudan, among more than 45,000 who have fled from fighting between the Ethiopian government and rebellious Tigray forces.
After crossing two weeks ago, he was brought by bus to the Um Rakuba camp in Sudan's Qadarif state -- the same site he came to when fleeing the famine that had ravaged northern Ethiopia in 1985. 
""The first time I came was because of famine but now it's because of war, that's why I feel really sad and I feel so much pain,"" said Berhan, sitting in the shade against some foam matting as he rested an old leg injury.
    He recounted how dead bodies were strewn behind him as he fled amid heavy fire. He had no chance to identify them, but is sure they were from his village, Rayan. 
""I could not manage to look back because I was thinking about my family and how to escape and how to get out of the country,"" he said. 
""I wasn't the only one walking. So many people were walking alongside me, and mothers carrying their children on their backs, and others the same age as me.""
Like other mainly Tigrayan refugees who have fled to Sudan, Berhan blamed the violence on government forces and allied militia. Reuters was unable to verify his claims. 
The government denies it has killed civilians in the conflict. Both sides have accused the other of ethnic-based killings, while denying responsibility for carrying them out.
Thousands of people are believed to have been killed since fighting broke out in Tigray, where Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government has been trying to quell a rebellion by the Tigray People's Liberation Front.
Assertions from all sides are difficult to verify since phone and internet links to Tigray have been down and access tightly controlled since the conflict began on Nov. 4.
    ""This is inhumane, slaughtering people, stealing all their belongings, I feel the world has betrayed Tigray because people are doing nothing while people are being killed,"" said Berhan.
Conditions at Um Rakuba are harsh. New arrivals have been sheltering under trees and tents made from sticks and plastic sheeting. Those not yet registered as refugees get two rations of sorghum porridge a day, which some complain is making them sick. 
Some teenagers pass the time playing volleyball next to a row of white tents, while others queue for food or try to sleep.
The war in Tigray region has heightened frictions between Ethiopia's myriad ethnic groups.
Ethiopian authorities said on Saturday that the military operation in Tigray was over, they controlled the regional capital Mekelle, and a hunt for the rebel leaders was under way.
    For Berhan, speaking on Sunday, the Ethiopian government had already won.
""They made a plan on how to destroy Tigray and the plan is about to happen. The attack is about to be accomplished,"" he said.

GROTTAFERRATA, Italy (Reuters) - In an ancient monastery behind huge medieval battlements in a hilltop town just south of Rome, 10 monks are striving to keep alive a 1,600-year-old spiritual tradition against increasing odds. 
Aged between 23 and 89, they are among Italy's last remaining Byzantine-rite Basilian monks - adherents of an order founded by St. Basil in 356 in present-day Turkey who still follow his ascetic regimen of prayer and work.
Brother Claudio Corsaro, 27, abandoned a promising career as an opera singer to become a monk. The only singing he does now is in the chapel. 
""I was only six years old when I felt the Lord for the first time but I fully realised my vocation many years later, when I had already started my singing career,"" he said while walking between olive trees in the monastery compound.
Corsaro and his confreres dress in the habit of Orthodox churchmen, including flowing black robes and the traditional flat-topped round hat.
Basilian monk St Nilus founded the Grottaferrata abbey in 1004, 50 years before the Great Schism of 1054 split Eastern and Western Christianity.
At the time, the Grottaferrata monks chose to remain faithful to the pope in Rome rather than switch allegiance to the newly established Orthodox patriarch in Constantinople, now Istanbul.
However, to this day they worship in the Eastern, Byzantine rite, including saying the Divine Liturgy, their version of the Mass, in ancient Greek. Catholics in the West say the Mass in local languages and occasionally in Latin.
The daily regimen starts at 5:30 a.m. with individual prayer and communal worship. Then there is work in the vegetable garden and olive groves, painting icons, study, and house chores. Lunch is followed by rest, vespers, more work, more prayer and then early to bed.
Most of the monks have connections to tiny ethnic Greek or Albanian communities in southern Italy populated by descendants of early settlers from the East.
They are the last monks of the Italo-Albanian tradition to follow the Rule of St. Basil.
Brother Filippo Pecoraro, 23, was raised in an Italo-Albanian family in Sicily and is from the Arbereshe people who fled Ottoman invasions of the Balkans between the 14th and 18th centuries.
""I grew up in an environment very close to the Church and this life choice was inside me,"" Pecoraro said.
The young blood has not stopped the order's numbers from shrinking significantly. In the middle of the last century the abbey was home to around 80 monks. 
Nonetheless, Corsaro is steadfast in his belief that preserving the ancient tradition is his sacred calling.

""I feel like someone the Lord has chosen among the few to continue this responsibility and I thank God for the grace he has given me to carry out this task,"" he said.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - TC Energy (NYSE:TRP) Corp's sale of a C$1 billion ($769 million) stake in Keystone XL (KXL) to a Canadian indigenous group is the result of over three years of pressure from a tiny Saskatchewan First Nation that demanded part ownership of the long-delayed oil pipeline, rather than short-term payments for allowing it to be built through its lands.
Natural Law Energy's (NLE) planned investment was billed by TC as the biggest-ever indigenous investment in an oil project, highlighting how some communities are seeking to share in the industry's profits while others oppose it.
Adding indigenous support may help efforts by Canada and TC to convince U.S. President-elect Joe Biden not to revoke the permit of the $8-billion Keystone XL when he takes office as he has promised. 
If they are successful, millions of dollars will flow over a generation into indigenous communities to help youth afford university or pay for business investments, said Chief Alvin Francis of Nekaneet First Nation in Saskatchewan, one of five involved in NLE.
""It's about making life better for all of our youth,"" Francis said.
""If I could meet Joe Biden I’d say, 'This a chance for you to change my First Nation's view of the world.'"" 
TC proposed KXL 12 years ago and the project has since run into a steady series of legal and political obstacles, opposed by some U.S. tribes, landowners and environmental activists.
Nekaneet, a community of about 540 people, has never been involved in a deal of this scale, having previously developed a strip mall.
It joined four First Nations - Ermineskin, Akamihk, Louis Bull Tribe and Little Pine - to form NLE. The coalition has attracted interest from banks in financing TC's project, given that much of its shipping capacity is already under contract, said NLE director Brian Mountain. He declined to identify the banks. 
""What we're doing is creating intergenerational wealth,"" Mountain said.
NLE is talking with Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corp, a provincial corporation, about guaranteeing some of the loans, he said.
Spokespeople for Canada's six big banks declined to comment or did not respond. There is precedent for banks supporting indigenous investments in energy, such as a C$545 million bond issue for two bands in 2017 to invest in a Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) Inc storage facility.
Financing is set to close in the third quarter next year, likely well after Biden clarifies his position on KXL, easing risk for the First Nations, said Ken Coates, a professor of public policy at University of Saskatchewan. 
Francis said while there is risk Biden will quash KXL, he is optimistic his position will soften.
LONG-TERM DEAL
He said he asked TC in 2017 for a benefits-sharing agreement that would last KXL's lifetime. TC balked, but in late 2019 it contacted Francis and asked if Nekaneet would buy a stake.
That began a year of negotiations and development of the coalition.
Under the deal, TC would give NLE a stake and pay it a prescribed annual return in exchange for NLE raising funds and investing them in KXL, Mountain said. 
NLE would use the proceeds to repay loans for its investment and provide cash to its First Nations for 30 years. 
The payments will be based on KXL's revenues. Mountain and TC declined to estimate the payments' value and TC did not confirm NLE's account of the deal's structure, saying it was confidential.
For TC, the investment allows the company to tie up less of its own capital, after recently selling a stake in its Coastal GasLink pipeline to private equity.
The partnership reflects TC's commitment to sharing KXL's benefits with indigenous communities in both Canada and the United States, company spokesman Terry Cunha said.
Some oppose new pipelines for the toll fossil fuels have on the environment.
""Destroying the planet to make money is unconscionable, no matter who is making the money,"" said Steve Volker, lawyer for U.S.-based Indigenous Environmental Network.

74,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>",Lebanese students abroad fall prey to financial crisis at home,"By Samia Nakhoul and Imad Creidi
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese medical student Lara Mustafa faces eviction from Russia and the end of her dream of becoming a doctor if her parents, hit by Lebanon's worst financial crisis in decades, cannot send her money to pay for rent and expenses.
Another medical student, Wassim Hachem, 24, had to drop out from his fourth year of university in Russia to return to Lebanon and work as a delivery driver after his father, who lost his job, was no longer able to support him.
Mustafa and Hachem are among thousands of university students caught up in Lebanon's financial crisis, which started in 2019 with popular protests against leaders whom demonstrators blamed for corruption and mismanaging the economy.
An insolvent banking system, which had lent more than two thirds of its assets to the central bank and state, shut out all depositors from their dollar accounts, and Lebanon defaulted on its debts.
The COVID-19 pandemic added to mass job losses and business collapses.
Lebanon traditionally prides itself on its education system. American and French missionaries set up schools and universities in the 19th century that became platforms for young Lebanese to further their studies abroad.
That is now becoming a dream for all but the richest, who managed to keep enough of their wealth outside Lebanon.
Some students are struggling to make ends meet even in relatively low-cost countries like Russia.
""You can say that my parents sank into debt in order to be able to send me money,"" Mustafa, 23, who is on a scholarship, told Reuters from Russia via Zoom.
""I live in the student dorms. The system at our university is that if I can't pay the dorm fees not only will I be evicted but I will be forbidden from taking the end-of-semester exam.
""Now I live in austerity, now I calculate every penny.""
NO ACCESS TO MONEY
Some parents of the thousands of Lebanese students abroad have been protesting outside the Banque du Liban (BDL), Lebanon's central bank.
They insist the central bank forces commercial banks to implement a government decree to allow families with students abroad to transfer up to $10,000 a year at the official exchange rate of 1,500 Lebanese pounds to the dollar to cover tuition and expenses. 
Until now parents and students say the law is being ignored, with banks and exchange dealers refusing to make transfers at the set rate and instead demanding the market rate, currently around 8,300 Lebanese pounds.
Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh told Reuters that ""the law needs applications decrees from the government not from BDL."" Officials at the Lebanese banking association could not immediately be reached for comment.
Mustafa's mother Nidaa Hassan, 47, said they used to send her between $300-$700 a month but now manage much smaller amounts.
She has taken her other children out of a private school and enrolled them in a state school because her husband's salary, which was worth $2,000 a month last year, is now equal to $370 after the collapse of the Lebanese pound.
""We are not only borrowing money from here, but also from (family) abroad to be able to send her money. I don't know how much debt we have accumulated so far,"" she said in Beirut.
In a cruel twist, banks that can no longer honour their debts have for over a year denied depositors access to money, so even those with substantial funds cannot withdraw them.
Lebanon's middle class is being squeezed, and, like many other Lebanese, Nidaa blames the government.
Lebanese politicians are trying to secure foreign aid to help them reduce huge debts, but they have yet to carry out the reforms that potential donors are demanding.
The fact that they have been unable to form a government since the last one resigned in August over what it called endemic corruption is exacerbating the problem, according to Western diplomats.
'I LOST EVERYTHING'
Mohammad Kassar, 22, was into his fifth year of medicine in Ukraine, aiming to become a general practitioner, when he was forced to return home in May because his father, whose furniture business went bust, was no longer able to transfer him money.
""It is a very harsh feeling to lose hope. In one year I lost all the five years I have invested in...I lost the past, the present and the future. I lost everything,"" Kassar said.
Nadia Moussa, mother of Wassim Hachem, said her focus was now on survival.
""Our dream now is to be able to eat, to put food on the table. Can we dream of anything else?""
Wael Dib Hajj, a 30-year-old consultant, saved up for seven years and was accepted into Yale's MBA programme this year. But after requesting documents from the university, his bank refused to transfer the tuition fees.
""When I first put the deposit in the bank, I had told them it would be for education...When the papers were ready, they said the file was okay, but then as soon as they saw the amount, they were like 'no way, forget about it'.
    ""These are my savings from my job and they're in dollars...I've been saving for this for seven years.""

He said that Yale had agreed to defer his studies until next year. He plans to apply for a loan, but since that would cover about 80%, he will work to cover the rest.

75,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",Democracy darkens: Hong Kong activists reel from Chinese moves,"By James Pomfret and Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Prince Wong was still in her mother's womb when the Chinese government reclaimed control over Hong Kong from the British in the summer of 1997. She was born nearly three months later, on September 27, into what some here call the city's ""cursed generation.""
For her 23rd birthday this year, Wong posted a photo of herself on Instagram wearing a pastel-striped paper hat trimmed with pink pompoms. She has a slight smile on her face as she looks down at her birthday cake, a moment of celebration at odds with her words below: ""There are great sorrows in life that cannot be washed away with tears. Is life always so painful? Or is it only when I was young?""
On a recent day, Wong spun a gold ring on her finger in continuous circles as she spoke quietly about the past year of her life. It has been a year filled with disappointment and dread.
She faces trial early next year on a riot charge stemming from the anarchic standoff between police and pro-democracy protesters at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University last November. Legislative elections were postponed after she won 23,000 votes in an unofficial protest poll organised by the pro-democracy camp this summer to get on the ballot. And she witnessed friends being arrested and detained – sometimes for little more than a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post – under a new national security law that has raised the risks for those like her directly challenging Chinese rule.
Then this month, a fresh nadir. China's parliament passed a resolution that will effectively bar any opposition politicians deemed subversive from Hong Kong's legislature. City Chief Executive Carrie Lam immediately kicked four pro-democracy lawmakers out of office. Soon after that, the city's democrats resigned en masse, leaving the legislature devoid of any opposition democrats for the first time since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.
""Regardless of whether you are a front-line politician, anonymous protester, in the media, a teacher or in any profession, they are carrying out a serious political crackdown, and they hope to put everyone in jail,"" Wong said.
Wong is part of a crop of young democrats in the so-called ""resistance bloc"" who aim to upend the political order through disruptive, unorthodox tactics: the nihilistic laam chau –  ""If we burn, you burn with us,"" a slogan in ""The Hunger Games.""
""It's the fate of our generation,"" Wong said. ""We were just born in a period of historical political change. This is something we have to face.""
A year after young activists, veteran democrats, working-class families and middle-class professionals collectively formed the boldest people's revolt against Beijing in decades, Hong Kong is being ""mainlandized"" with shocking rapidity, democracy advocates say. The Chinese government, they say, is using the unrest that engulfed the city last year as a pretext for a so-called second handover: the first in the 1997 transfer of power, the second moving it to China's vision of a police state.
A Hong Kong government spokesman adamantly denies that, saying that any accusation that the government is ""'crushing civil liberties' is groundless."" Mainland authorities didn't respond to questions from Reuters.
Beijing's tough new paradigm has demoralised, damaged and divided the city's democracy movement, which for decades sought to hold China to account on its historical promise to allow the city to exist as a bubble of liberalism. More than 10,000 people have been jailed, even as protests have shrivelled. Some democrats are struggling with depression. Others compare the city to a giant prison. Hundreds have fled into exile. But even in dark days, they haven't given up.
This is the story of four Hong Kong activists divided by age but united by a deep love of their city – and the toll the last year has taken on them. One is 23, full of passion and conviction. One is 82, and has seen it all. One is in his late 30s, and lives in fear of arrest. And one is 28, and has chosen a painful path: leaving the city of her birth.
All four speak of persevering, keeping the spirit of the movement alive among friends and family, and waiting for the day the city might rise up again.
THE PIONEER
Martin Lee's apartment is airy and spacious, without clutter, each item – from English and French classical furniture to tall Chinese Qing vases – given the space to breathe, redolent of the East-West soul of Hong Kong itself.
Lee, 82, an anglophile whose father was a connoisseur of Chinese ink brush painting and calligraphy, was a key advisor to Britain and China during the crucial negotiations in the 1980s that paved the way for the 1997 handover and its ""one country, two systems"" equation for government that afforded the city a high degree of autonomy. A forceful orator who helped found the city's first major pro-democracy party, he has long advocated engagement with China, to seek common ground in moving forward.
But during a recent interview, the gaunt and gravelly voiced barrister was more guarded than at any other time we'd spoken since our first meeting near the time of the handover. His hair had whitened in recent months, and his steps were slow and deliberate.
""I can't see any way out. Up until recently, there was always some reason for hope,"" he said. ""They don't want Hong Kong people to have hope for a full implementation of one country, two systems,"" he said of the mainland leadership.
His apartment looks over the hills of Hong Kong, forested with a mix of trees and skyscrapers.
""Every time I look at the beautiful scenery I ask, why are they killing our city?"" he said.
Lee, a longtime pacifist embracing the activism and philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, is haunted by the Chinese military's massacre of students and other civilians in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. He thinks it was a mistake for Hong Kong's protesters to resort to violence last year, because ""you give an excuse to the other side to use violence, and how can you beat them with violence?""
Instead, he thinks, by resurrecting mass peaceful protests, and bringing back the pacifist middle classes and grass roots, the movement could find new impetus, as long as authorities don't begin to unilaterally bar public demonstrations, as in China.
But at the same time, he mused: ""How can I blame the young people when they saw how we had failed to get democracy in the past 30 years by not using force? These thoughts of course are conflicting.""
Wong, the young activist nearly 60 years Lee's junior who planned to run in the scuttled legislative elections, has no patience for the older generation of Hong Kong activists. She says they have clung to a political system increasingly rigged against them.
""They've completely failed to achieve anything over the past decades,"" she said. ""I could understand why they did what they did back then, as the time they were in was very different from us. But after all these passing years, if they keep using the same methods, I can't really accept it.""
She saw her candidacy as a way to go beyond the street unrest of last year. Recent tactics by her bloc have included advocacy campaigns for those arrested, and provoking greater international pressure on Beijing with their runs for public office – and the subsequent, and expected, disqualification of 12 of their bloc from running. After the Hong Kong government postponed the elections for a year, the United States imposed unprecedented sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials.
Activist Finn Lau, 27, who developed the ""if we burn, you burn with us"" theory, said in a recent interview: ""The situation is actually not that bad. It's the best of the worst situations. ... If we can continue to laam chau and weaken the economic power of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, it's not impossible to make them back down.""
But many of the resistance bloc are paying a high price. Lau fled Hong Kong for Britain in January after being arrested on charges of unlawful assembly. Prominent activist Joshua Wong, another leader of the bloc, has pleaded guilty to charges of organising and inciting an unlawful assembly and could be imprisoned for three years when sentenced this week.
Lee Cheuk-yan, a veteran democrat and labour unionist, has come to believe that the democracy movement must evolve even if the outcome could be uncertain.
""They've changed the game in unthinkable ways, the radicals,"" he said. ""The whole world, the younger generation looks at them with awe. What they've done is something that we could never do, the older generation.""
Martin Lee accepts that this new generation will lead the way forward.
""I know my role is over,"" Lee said. ""The young people will take over, as they should.""
Lee, who was arrested earlier this year and charged with organising an illegal assembly, is preparing for a trial slated for early next year. It's the first time he's faced criminal charges after more than 50 years as a barrister. He said at the time he was ""proud"" to stand alongside the thousands of other people arrested since the protests began last year.
But the scope of the national security law and current moves against protesters and professionals such as teachers, journalists and academics have made the future of activism bleak.
Article 63 of the national security law states that Chinese law will ""prevail"" over Hong Kong laws in the event of any dispute, and that some trials could be conducted in closed courts and bail denied defendants. Under the law, suspects in complex cases could be extradited to mainland China and tried under the laws there. Chinese security agents operating in Hong Kong will enjoy immunity from prosecution. Judges hearing national security cases will be appointed by the city's leader, breaking a longstanding separation-of-powers arrangement under which such appointments are overseen by the city's chief justice. The law also applies globally, unnerving even those who've fled abroad.
In response to the democrats' assertions, the Hong Kong government spokesman said it ""will continue to implement the 'one country, two systems' principle,"" maintaining that the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers are well protected and that the legislature remains a place of pluralistic views.
As for last year's protests, the spokesman said: ""From mid-2019 to early 2020, unprecedented violence, reckless and organised destruction plagued the city. These unlawful and violent acts must be condemned, curbed and ended if Hong Kong is to continue as a vibrant international financial, business and logistics hub.  As in any society that believes in the rule of law, it is incumbent on the Government to maintain public safety and order.""
Some Chinese officials with direct oversight of Hong Kong affairs say they're satisfied with the impact of the security law in tamping down unrest. Longer term, they don't rule out further measures to rein in the city's dissenting voices, including a proposed law to allow Hong Kongers to vote at balloting centers in mainland China. Democrats say this is a ploy by authorities to further stack the odds against the pro-democracy candidates in the next legislative council elections, with most of the voters casting ballots from mainland China likely to back pro-Beijing candidates.
""Old and cunning people like Martin Lee use younger guys in the democracy camp to try to overthrow and destabilise the Chinese Communist Party,"" said one Chinese official who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter. ""Beijing will only accept a loyal opposition.""
Lee shrugs off such a view, saying that even if his hope in the Chinese Communist Party living up to its promises on Hong Kong is gone, ""I can see another hope: hope that comes from the way Hong Kong people, including young people, fought to defend their core values and their way of life … by sacrificing so much, including many years in prison.""
Lee understands he may not live to see his democratic ideals take root in Hong Kong. But he has faith that it will happen nonetheless.
""I never say die; I never give up,"" Lee, a devout Catholic, said in a subsequent meeting at a church. ""I may not be there to see democracy coming to Hong Kong or coming to China, but it will come one day.  For democracy will reach every shore.""
THE RESCUER
Last year's protests reached a zenith during the two-week siege of Poly U, as Polytechnic University is known.
For months, police struggled to contain the protesters, who moved fluidly through Hong Kong's dense urban landscapes, deploying their ""be water"" strategy of staging flash protests mobilised on social media and encrypted apps. But at Poly U, all escape routes were sealed off by the police. The movement had no place to flow to, and thousands were trapped.
Clad in black with makeshift shields, helmets and gas masks, protesters remained defiant, chanting ""liberate Hong Kong."" They hurled petrol bombs, fired arrows and lobbed broken bricks from giant catapults for days on end, and were met with a hail of tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets. Giant fireballs occasionally ripped into the sky, and plumes of black smoke curled upward in columns visible across Victoria Harbour. In a Chinese military base next to Poly U, armed People's Liberation Army troops watched the situation unfold while conducting anti-riot drills in an open forecourt.
On the outskirts, thousands of regular Hong Kongers came to the rescue, including Dave, a skilled diver. He described his role on condition that his last name not be used. Participants in the Poly U occupation have been arrested on rioting-related charges, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
Dave, who is in his late 30s, watched the standoff with dread on his phone, glued to his private Telegram group of regular Hong Kongers providing logistical, financial and medical support to the protesters.
He thought he might be able to scout a way into the campus from a submerged tunnel in Victoria Harbour via a labyrinth of sewers, to find a path out for those trapped inside.
He messaged several of his diving buddies but wasn't 100% straight with them.
""I just told them, 'We're going diving tomorrow; I know a good place. We're going to catch crabs.' You always catch crabs at night.""
Dave and his fellow divers prepped their gear, then took a boat to the choppy waters near the Hong Kong Coliseum where Cantopop concerts are held. The group had obtained detailed subterranean maps drafted by the Drainage Services Department. They plunged in backward with their scuba gear and oxygen tanks. In the murk they made their way into the black hole.
The route that Dave and his diving buddies helped scout led roughly a kilometre underground from Poly U, below a crematorium, to manhole covers near the famous Kwun Yum Temple in the area of Kowloon known as Hung Hom, where subterranean waters can be heard gushing loudly after rainstorms.
The century-old temple, filled with coils of incense and hung with lanterns painted with tigers, is devoted to the goddess of mercy. Built in 1873 in the early decades of British rule, the temple survived Japanese bombardments during World War II. It is considered a place of miracles, as well as a preserve of Chinese traditions through a breathtaking century and a half of change.
""The way out is easy if you know where to go,"" Dave said. ""But without a map, it's a terrifying labyrinth.""
In photographs of the sewer system later published by netizens, the waters were neck-high as the protesters edged their way out, connected by their Ariadne's thread, a red climbing rope. Fluorescent sticks cast light on walls filled with cockroaches.
Dave estimates the mission saved hundreds of protesters through escape routes he helped scout with his team. Those emerging from the sewers jumped into waiting cars.
Some see the Poly U siege as a metaphor for what the entire city has now become under the security law: people trapped inside, with those on the outside, including the West, trying to come to the rescue.
Dave, a man with a big laugh and a penchant for Scottish single malts, represents a swathe of regular middle-class Hong Kong professionals who've increasingly aligned with the younger generation spearheading the movement. Though far less visible, these older people with wealth and skills risk arrest for assisting the protesters. Dave says he has spent large amounts of money on the movement, including for medical treatment for protesters.
Dave believes the movement is becoming increasingly radical, with many people now choosing to bide their time and go underground, preparing mentally and logistically for more mass protests or, potentially, a more violent path. He says he could leave Hong Kong anytime but won't despite the darkening mood. He wants to persevere with the democracy movement, though he thinks the reality is grim.
""Hong Kong has become a jail. No one can get out. We're all trapped,"" he said. ""Even those that get out are still trapped in their minds, for the city is trapped.
""We've become like a giant Poly U.""
THE EXILE
Eli, a 28-year-old who was arrested during the Poly U standoff, remembers the moment the protests changed her.
It was June 12 last year, and police were firing tear gas at peaceful protesters whose arms and sometimes necks were wrapped in cling film to protect themselves from getting burned. Something snapped inside her as she sent supplies of safety goggles, water, helmets and umbrellas to the front line.
At a protest a month later, she picked up a brick from a sidewalk, intending to hurl it at riot police. But she kept it in her hand for hours instead, eventually tossing it in a bin.
""When I held a brick with my hand, I felt so heavy. I wasn't sure whether or not I should throw it,"" she said. ""I only knew that since that night, I understood I could protect myself and others if I held a weapon in my hand.""
After the Poly U siege, Eli was charged with rioting, facing a maximum of 10 years in prison. In March, she fled Hong Kong for Canada, fearing she might be charged with other offences.
She kept her plans secret from her family, who she says are all pro-Beijing and thought she was traveling abroad to study. She was also leaving behind her boyfriend. At the airport, she says, her heart was pumping as she feared customs officials might discover the documents she had prepared seeking political asylum in Canada.
""I didn't have much feeling until the plane started flying. I began to cry. At first, I felt relieved. But I also realized that I wouldn't have a chance to go back to Hong Kong anymore,"" she told Reuters in a two-hour phone call on an encrypted app. ""I felt like I have abandoned my loved one.""
Eli, who suffers from a defective heart valve, remains plagued by guilt for leaving. One time, she said, her boyfriend woke up from a nightmare and called her. She tried to comfort him, but he lashed out.
""'What are you scared of? You have left already,'"" he told her. ""I was hurt by what he said… He later apologised and knew he said something wrong, but it's also a cruel fact.""
After arriving in Canada, Eli finally had the time to recover from the traumatic experience at the front line. Advised by her doctor, she tries to take a walk every day for stress relief.
But she's been buffeted by a stream of bad news on her iPhone. Other activists have gone into exile, some by plane, others by speedboat. Some have been caught fleeing, including 12 who were intercepted by the Chinese coast guard and kept incommunicado in a mainland jail, denied access to family, friends and family-appointed lawyers.
Still, Eli has plunged into advocacy work in her adopted country, helping organise rallies, designing protest art: little acts to sustain the West's attention on Hong Kong.
Fellow activists have done the same in other countries, including Taiwan, Britain, the United States and Australia, forging an international front of resistance that follows those from other restive parts of China, including Tibet and Xinjiang.
""To Hong Kongers, there's no resistance without paying a heavy cost,"" she said. ""I think Hong Kongers need to be like water, and try to find grey areas where they can continue to resist. ... I'm still resisting here in a foreign country.""
THE FUTURE
Prince Wong was a committed protester who went to almost every demonstration last year. Her time ran out at midnight on November 18, 2019, during the Poly U standoff.
She was in Yau Ma Tei, a district close to campus. There were desperate calls online for reinforcements to save those trapped inside. A police van, its siren blaring, suddenly screeched toward the protesters, causing a stampede. She tried running away, but was pressed down by the strong arms of a cop and arrested.
""My life planning was messed up and greatly affected by the rioting case. I could be put in jail at any time. I was pushed to the edge by the regime,"" she said.
She suffered from depression after her arrest. When some of her friends arrested in other protests learned that, they encouraged her to go hiking with them in the hills, valleys, islands and shores of Hong Kong's wilder places. She started to heal and reflect on what more she could do.
""I wanted to use my situation to do more, to speak out more, and so I started to think about running for the election.""
She decided to run in the now-cancelled legislative council elections, to become the face and voice for the anonymous protesters.
""Running for the election was never my final goal,"" said Wong, a final-year student at Lingnan University. ""I want to continue the momentum of the protests. It's a medium to continue my role, or to speak for those who might not be able to show their face.""
Reuters first interviewed Wong back in 2015, a year after she staged a hunger strike outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong during the so-called ""umbrella movement"" fighting for democratic rights. That movement, which saw protesters blocking major roads in the city for almost three months, failed to wrest any concessions from China, but sowed the seeds for the bigger battle last year.
""The elderly often say that my generation will be the ones to live long enough to see a democratic Hong Kong,"" she said at the time. ""But I am not so naive to fully believe that it will happen in our time, either.""
Five years later, she still feels the same, except there's more responsibility on her shoulders to pass on the light in the darkest hours of Hong Kong's democracy movement.

""I won't feel depressed because we can't achieve it now. You will influence the next generation, and maybe they will know the answer.""

76,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Indian PM Modi refuses to back down on farm reforms despite huge protests,"By Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday resisted calls for the repeal of farm reforms that have ignited the biggest protests by farmers in years around the national capital, saying they were being misled and that deregulation would benefit them.
Thousands of people from the big farming state of Punjab were camped out on the outskirts of Delhi for a fifth day demanding that they be allowed to stage protests in the city centre against the new laws that open up India's tightly regulated farm produce market.
Farmers who could earlier sell grains and other products only at neighbouring government-regulated wholesale markets can now sell them across the country, including to big food processing companies and retailers such as WalMart. 
But farm groups and opposition parties say the government will eventually abolish the wholesale markets, where growers were assured of a minimum support price for staples like wheat and rice, leaving small farmers at the mercy of corporate agri-businesses.
Speaking at a public rally during a visit to his political constituency of Varanasi in northern India, Modi dismissed the fears as misplaced. 
""The new agricultural laws have been brought in for benefit of the farmers. We will see and experience benefits of these new laws in the coming days,"" he said. He blamed the opposition for spreading rumours about the future of farmers.
The farm sector contributes nearly 15% of India’s $2.9 trillion economy and employs around half its 1.3 billion people.
The government says the deregulation of the sector will attract investment and fix the supply chains that lose a quarter of India’s produce to wastage.
But Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, said the new laws would benefit big business and accused Modi of crony capitalism. 

""Our farmers are standing up against the black laws, they have reached Delhi leaving their farms and families behind. Do you want to stand with them or with Modi's capitalist friends?"" he said in a tweet.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 06:57AM ET</span>","Iran opposition suspected alongside Israel in scientist's killing, Shamkani says","By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - A senior Iranian official said on Monday an opposition group was suspected alongside Israel in the killing of a prominent Iranian nuclear scientist, an attack that has raised the prospect of a new standoff between Tehran and its longtime enemy.
Iran's English-language Press TV reported the weapon used in Friday's killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was made in Israel.
""The weapons collected from the site of the terrorist act bear the logo and specifications of the Israeli military industry,"" an unnamed source told Press TV.
In Jerusalem, there was no immediate reply from Israeli officials contacted for comment on the report.
Speaking before the Press TV report, Israeli intelligence minister Eli Cohen told radio station 103 FM on Monday that he did not know who was responsible.
Fakhrizadeh, who had little public profile in Iran but had been named by Israel as a prime player in what it says is Iran’s nuclear weapons quest, was killed on Friday when he was ambushed on a highway near Tehran and his car sprayed with bullets. 
Ali Shamkhani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, told state TV: ""This was a very complicated assassination that was carried out remotely with electronic devices.""
""We have some clues but surely the 'Monafeghin' group was involved and the criminal element behind it is the Zionist regime (Israel) and Mossad,"" he added, referring to Israel's foreign intelligence service.
""Monafeghin"" is a term officials employ to refer to the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an umbrella bloc of opposition groups in exile that seek an end to Shi’ite Muslim clerical rule. 
CEMETERY
Iran began Fakhrizadeh's burial at a cemetery in northern Tehran on Monday, state TV reported, as the defence minister promised the Islamic Republic would retaliate for his killing. Iran’s clerical and military rulers have blamed Israel for Fakhrizadeh's killing.
Iran's semi-official Fars news agency said on Sunday that Fakhrizadeh had been killed by a machine gun operated by remote control, while the Arabic language Al Alam TV reported the weapons used in the attack were ""controlled by satellite"". 
When asked about potential Iranian reprisals, Cohen told radio station 103: ""We have regional intelligence supremacy, and on this matter we are prepared, we are increasing vigilance, in the places where that is required."" 
Iran's hardline Kayhan daily, whose editor-in-chief is named by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in an opinion piece on Sunday called for an attack on the Israeli port city of Haifa, if an Israeli role in Fakhrizadeh’s killing is proven.
However, Iran’s rulers are aware of daunting military and political difficulties in attacking Israel. Such an attack would also complicate any effort by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to revive detente with Tehran after he takes office on Jan. 20.
Tensions have increased between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when Trump exited Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.
In retaliation, Tehran gradually breached the deal’s curbs on its nuclear programme. Biden has said he will return the United States to the deal if Iran resumes compliance. 

Tehran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will begin discussions on Monday on how best to ""renew and reinvigorate"" transatlantic relations after the departure of U.S. President Donald Trump, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.
Ambassadors from the 27 EU countries will consider five broad policy areas on which they see greater opportunities for cooperation when Joe Biden takes over as president after four years of strained ties since Trump introduced his ""America First"" policy.
""The arrival of a new administration and congress ... is an opportunity for the EU to renew and reinvigorate its strategic partnership with the U.S. based on mutual interests,"" said the document prepared for envoys.
""The EU should agree a set of concrete priorities on which to engage the new US leadership,"" it said.
The document identified the main policy areas as: health including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, boosting economic recovery, combating climate change, promoting peace and security and upholding shared values including a belief in multilateral rules.
EU leaders are expected to debate transatlantic relations when they convene for a summit on Dec. 10-11.
The European Commission and the EU's foreign service, the EEAS, have prepared another document, first reported by the Financial Times, that would rebuild ties on common fronts including digital regulation.
The strategies by EU governments and the EU's executive Commission underline optimism in Europe that a Biden presidency will mark a new chapter reinforcing EU priorities on combating climate change, nuclear proliferation and human rights.
Many European leaders watched with shock as Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate change agreement and the deal between world powers and Iran limiting Tehran's nuclear activities, imposed tariffs on EU goods and spurned multilateral bodies that Washington has backed for decades.
However, one EU diplomat cautioned against any assumption that the EU and the United States would agree on all issues. 
""There will be a change of tone from Biden, but the tough U.S. stance on China, the insistence that Europeans spend more on defence - they will remain,"" the diplomat said.
Charles Michel, the former Belgian prime minister who heads the grouping of EU nations called the European Council, has invited Biden to an in-person summit in the first half of 2021, with a virtual summit perhaps soon after he takes office.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the EU is looking forward to the United States rejoining the Paris agreement, which Biden has said he will do.

79,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 06:56AM ET</span>","'Christmas will not be cancelled' says Bethlehem, amid little comfort or joy","By Rami Ayyub
BETHLEHEM, West Bank (Reuters) - Bethlehem is shaping up for a dismal Christmas: most of the inns are closed, the shepherds are likely to be under lockdown and there are few visitors from the east, or anywhere else.
Just 12 months ago, the Palestinian town was celebrating its busiest festive season for two decades, amid a sustained drop in violence and a corresponding surge in the number of pilgrims and tourists.
But hotels that were adding new wings in 2019 are now shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Nevertheless, town leaders say the traditional birthplace of Jesus will go ahead with its celebrations, aware that the world's eyes are upon it at this time of year.
""Bethlehem is going to celebrate Christmas. And Christmas will not be cancelled,"" said Mayor Anton Salman, as workers behind him erected a huge Christmas tree in Manger Square.
""This Christmas from Bethlehem there will be a message of hope to the whole world, that the world will recover from this pandemic.""
The newly-appointed Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, on Monday sought to rally the Holy Land faithful, saying that preparations had already started.
His fellow Franciscan friar Father Francesco Patton, the Custodian of the Holy Land, launched the seasonal celebrations on Saturday, presiding over a service in a near-deserted Church of the Nativity.
""This Christmas will be less festive than usual as there will be restrictions, I suppose like any other part of the world,"" Pizzaballa said in an interview with a Catholic news service.
""Maybe the civil law will forbid us to celebrate as we want; the pandemic will impose restrictions, but none will stop us from expressing the true meaning of Christmas which is to make an act of love.""
ROOM AT THE INN 
Rula Maayah, the Palestinian Authority's tourism minister, said this year was particularly challenging because it followed record tourism in 2018 and 2019, which then slumped to near-zero foreign tourism, and fewer Christian Palestinians coming as pilgrims.
A third factor, say tourist guides and souvenir shop owners, is that the pandemic's toll on the global economy has devastated sales over the Internet – which typically spike during the holiday season.
At noon in Manger Square in what would normally be a frenetic build-up to Christmas, the plaza was almost empty in November, with just a few people milling around. Shop after shop was closed and market stalls were selling just a few trinkets.
In Nativity Street, Michael Canawati's souvenir store is a popular stop for tourist coaches that would typically buy key chains engraved with images of Jesus or intricately carved Nativity scenes made from Palestinian olive wood.
But Canawati has not opened his shop in weeks, is struggling to pay employees' salaries and was forced to permanently close his second store in Jerusalem.
""We are at a dead end. The shop is full of merchandise,"" he told Reuters. ""The whole world is in the same problem that we are in. We put some promotions (online) for Christmas...and still nothing,"" Canawati said.
Elias al-Arja, chairman of the Arab Hotel Association, said the town and the world faced the same problem.

""I have worked in tourism for 30 years. We have had ups and downs because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but never anything like this.""

Somalia also recalled its ambassador from Nairobi.
""As a result of the Kenyan government's political interferences in the internal affairs of Somalia, the regional President of Jubbaland has reneged on the election agreement that was reached on the 17th September 2020 in Mogadishu,"" the Somali Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The statement did not elaborate on the interference or the agreement the Jubbaland president had reneged on. 
This is not the first time there has been tension between Mogadishu and Nairobi. 
Last year, Kenya recalled its ambassador after Mogadishu decided to auction oil and gas exploration blocks at the centre of a maritime territorial dispute. The two countries restored ties a few months later.
Kenya's government spokesman, Cyrus Oguna, did not immediately comment on the latest dispute. 
Kenya contributes troops to Somalia as part of an African Union-led peacekeeping force which, along with the Somali federal government and local states, is fighting an al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency. 
Early on Monday, the militants attacked an army base in central Somalia, Major Nur Mohamud, told Reuters, adding that five soldiers had been killed.

LAGOS(Reuters) - At 7 a.m. on a recent Saturday, Onomene Adene received a call from a man whose voice she did not recognise.
The man said he knew her from church and asked for help getting a package to their pastor. She agreed to meet him at a bank near her home in the Nigerian city of Lagos.
But shortly after she arrived, according to Adene, three trucks pulled up filled with police armed with rifles and tear gas demanding that she take them to her brother. Terrified, she complied.
""It was like they were coming for war,"" Adene, 34, recounted days after the Nov. 7 incident, her hands shaking and her eyes welling with tears.
Police detained 27-year old Eromosele Adene that morning at his home, according to his sister and a bail application. Adene said her brother took part in nationwide protests last month against police brutality in the West African nation but hadn’t committed a crime.
Eromosele Adene is one of hundreds of demonstrators who have been detained since the protests began in early October. A group of lawyers providing legal aid to protesters said it has logged more than 300 detentions nationwide of people they believe to be innocent but that they expect the total to be higher. It added that many of those individuals have been released. Lagos State - home to sub-Saharan Africa’s most populous city - said on Nov. 8 that it had released 253 people.
The roughly two weeks of demonstrations, which called for abolishing a controversial police unit that has long been accused of violent harassment, drew thousands into the streets across Nigeria and grabbed world headlines in one of the largest movements of popular resistance to face Africa’s most populous country in years.
The Nigerian government swiftly announced it would disband the police unit, known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad or SARS, and ordered each state to set up judicial panels to investigate police abuse accusations.
But interviews with 18 activists, lawyers representing protesters and human rights advocates depict a pattern of intimidation of those who took part in the protests. In addition to detentions and the freezing of assets by the Central Bank, those interviewed by Reuters said some protesters had received threats or been subject to other harassment. They said further that they suspect the authorities are responsible because they bear the hallmarks of tactics used by authorities in the past. Reuters was unable to confirm who was behind the threats.
The extent of the detentions of peaceful protesters and intimidation tactics used have not previously been reported.
President Muhammadu Buhari, a military ruler in the 1980s before being elected president in 2015, has appealed for patience as the government attempts to meet protestors' demands. Spokesmen for the president referred questions about the protests to the military and the police.
Army spokesman Sagir Musa dismissed activists’ fears that they were being investigated, tracked or blocked from leaving the country as ""fake news.""
A spokesman for Nigeria’s federal police did not return requests for comment. Police have said the protests resulted in violence such as looting, arson, attacks and killings of - including of policemen - and that they will deploy the “full weight of the law and legitimate force (if necessary) in preventing a reoccurrence.”
Police in early November said they had arrested more than 1,500 people. Protesters and government officials have said that the people doing the looting and vandalism are not for the most part the same people who mobilised against police brutality.
Lawyers for police said in court that Eromosele Adene would be charged with criminal incitement, cyber stalking and provoking a breach of public peace, but haven’t filed charges. Adene’s lawyer said his client is innocent. Adene was released on bail after more than 10 days of detention; he is due to appear in court on Dec. 7.
DETENTIONS
Some people who participated in the protests - a movement dominated by young people who came of age after the nation’s transition to democracy in 1999 - said they have been taken aback by what they considered to be the repressive tactics of the authorities. But some observers said the crackdown against people associated with the demonstrations is reminiscent of the violent repression and state surveillance that characterized the country’s decades of military rule.
""The government has basically served a notice that everyone and anyone is fair game,"" said Ikemesit Effiong of Lagos-based risk consultancy SBM Intelligence. ""It’s something Buhari did in the 80s when he was the military head of state, and we are just seeing that playbook being reprised in 2020.”
The protests - organized under the name #EndSARS - broke out in early October after a video circulated allegedly showing members of the SARS police unit shooting dead a man in Delta state. The protests evolved to encompass discontent with corruption, a floundering economy and double-digit inflation that has stretched the ability of some families to even feed themselves without taking on debt.
It began as a largely peaceful movement, drawing the backing of business leaders and celebrities including musicians Kanye West and Beyonce. But the protests turned violent. On Oct. 20 police and soldiers killed at least 12 people in two Lagos neighbourhoods, including in the upmarket district of Lekki, according to witnesses and rights group Amnesty International. The army and police deny shooting protesters.
In the following days, angry crowds set fire to police stations and government offices. Looters raided shopping malls and government food warehouses.
The lawyers providing legal aid and activists said some of the protesters who have been detained have been released without charge, while others face charges such as looting, arson or disturbing the peace - allegations the lawyers contest.
Oluwatosin Adeniji, a 28-year-old journalist, said she was documenting a protest on Nov. 6 in Abuja when police, firing tear gas and live rounds, detained her along with five protesters. Adeniji - who was released on bail and hasn’t been formally charged - had been engaged in journalism and did not do anything wrong, according to her and her lawyer.
The police didn’t respond to a request for comment on Adeniji’s detention.
A prominent lawyer who provided legal aid to protesters had her passport seized at the airport when she tried to leave the country on Nov. 1, but it was later returned. The lawyer said when her passport was taken she was told her she was under military investigation.
Spokesmen for the Nigerian Immigration Service, the Interior Ministry, the military, the president’s office and security services declined to comment about whether she was under investigation.
THREATENING MESSAGES
Ten activists Reuters interviewed said they were aware of protesters receiving threatening phone calls and messages or being followed. Seven of them said they had personally received threats, and one of those said they also believed they had been under surveillance.
One text message reviewed by Reuters said the recipient would “lose your life” if they did not post a message on social media that the Lekki shooting did not happen, but would get 10 million naira (or about $26,000) if they did. The message came from a number the recipient didn’t recognize.
Reuters was unable to verify the other individual accounts.
Amnesty International also said it had heard from protesters, activists and even their own staff of similar messages, typically threatening punishment for what people have said or done and visits by people believed to be working for security services.
“We are aware of these things happening,” said Isa Sanusi, spokesman for Amnesty International.
Amnesty’s Sanusi and activists said the efforts were having a chilling effect, forcing people into hiding or to leave the country. Four of the activists Reuters interviewed said they were in hiding and at least two others had left the country.
One of those who had left the country said he went to the United States after friends in government warned him on Oct. 20 that security agents were tracking him for his involvement in the protests.
“If you’re a witness in a case against the government, you cannot sleep in your house,” said the man, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Akin.
""WE ARE VERY AFRAID""
Nigeria’s Central Bank has said it froze the accounts of 20 people involved in the demonstrations. According to an Oct. 20 court filing, the central bank wanted the assets frozen while it investigated whether there were links to terrorism financing.
Five of those who have had their accounts frozen denied involvement in terrorism financing when contacted by Reuters.
Adewunmi Enoruwa, 30, who helped crowdfund journalists investigating police violence, said the account of his company - a public relations firm called Gatefield - was frozen on Oct. 15 – more than two weeks before the central bank obtained a court order to do so on Nov. 4. He showed Reuters a letter from Access Bank dated Oct. 26 citing a Central Bank directive as the reason his account was frozen.
He said he vets donations and has no links with people or organizations that could be considered terrorists.
The Central Bank and Access Bank did not respond to requests for comment. Access Bank has publicly apologized to some customers impacted by the freeze and said it was compelled to comply with regulatory directives.

""We are very afraid,"" said Enoruwa.

Relations between the two nations have deteriorated to their worst in decades during outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump's four-year term, with disputes simmering over issues from trade and technology to Hong Kong and the coronavirus.
China's foreign ministry identified the four as John Knaus, senior director of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED); Manpreet Anand, a regional director of the National Democratic Institute (NDI); Kelvin Sit, the NDI's program director for Hong Kong and Crystal Rosario, a specialist at the NDI. 
From Monday, they will be banned from entering China, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said in the Chinese capital.
""The U.S. behaviour blatantly interferes in Hong Kong affairs and grossly interferes in China's domestic affairs,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, told a regular news briefing.
""It violates basic norms governing international relations, and China firmly rejects and condemns this.""
She gave no further details of the four, but the National Democratic Institute is a U.S. non-profit with more than three decades of support for democratic institutions and practices across the world, it says on its website.
This month, the United States said it was imposing sanctions on four more Chinese individuals tied to actions over the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The move followed Hong Kong's expulsion of four opposition members from its legislature after Beijing gave city authorities new powers to curb dissent. It triggered mass resignations by Hong Kong's pro-democracy opposition lawmakers.

China denies limiting rights and freedoms in mainly autonomous Hong Kong but authorities there and in Beijing have moved swiftly to stifle dissent after anti-government protests flared in June last year and plunged the city into crisis.

WARRAP STATE, South Sudan (Reuters) - James Athian and his nine children have been living in a makeshift camp in South Sudan's Warrap state for two months since floods destroyed their house.
Athian and his family are among the 377,300 people displaced by floods and violence in Warrap since July, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Nationwide, more than one million people have been temporarily forced from their homes.
""I have nine children and every time they get sick of malaria. (There is) no food and no good place to sleep,"" Athian told Reuters, standing near submerged houses in his village of Mangar Ajak.
Before the flooding, oil-producing South Sudan had already gone through five years of civil war, which ended in 2018 with a fragile peace deal. 
The worst rains in living memory have meant that roughly half of South Sudan's 78 counties have large swathes of land under water, the U.N. says.
Aleu Akol, 59, who has been at Mangar Ajak for one-and-a-half months, said people received aid from humanitarian organisations, but he had to find other means to supplement that.
""We fish in this water to survive because I don't have work that can generate income. See, my legs are swelling from (being in) the water,"" he said.
Attacks by bandits and ethnic militias are still common, compounding the effects of the floods.
""People are being killed randomly and insecurity is so bad that people were not able to cultivate (their crops) in May,"" Moses Athian Paul, coordinator of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission of Warrap's Tonj County, said. 

""If people don't get food from the government of the World Food Programme by February, many will die of hunger.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong tightened restrictions aimed at containing a rise in coronavirus cases on Monday, limiting gatherings to no more than two people, closing karaoke lounges and games centres and telling most civil servants to work from home.
The measures come in addition to restrictions announced on Sunday that will see all schools close for in-person learning for the rest of the year, also from Dec. 2.
Games centres, karaoke lounges and swimming pools will close from Wednesday and civil servants, excluding those that provide emergency services, will stay at home, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told reporters.
The Ocean Park theme park and DisneyLand will also close, said secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan.
""It will be very critical in the coming two weeks,"" Lam said. ""I hope that Hong Kong people can remain tolerant.""
Gyms and sports centres will remain open but only to a maximum of two people at a time, while massage and beauty salons will stay in operation, the government said. 
Restaurant dine-in hours will be shortened to 10 p.m. from midnight, with no more than two people per table. A ban on gatherings will also be capped at two people, down from four.
Bars in Hong Kong are already shut, but some are trying to skirt the rules by placing plates and cutlery with customers under the pretence they are dining.
The global financial centre has so far managed to avoid the widespread outbreak of the disease seen in many major cities across the world, although the stop-start restrictions have caused frustration among some business owners and residents. 
While there had been a ban on gatherings of more than four people, larger groups of residents have been widely seen together across the territory, especially on weekends and public holidays, although it's rare to see anyone without a face mask. 
Lam said there were 76 new cases on Monday, bringing the total in the city of 7.4 million to more than 6,300 since the epidemic started, with 109 deaths. Forty of the latest tally were related to dance clubs. The overall figure was lower than Sunday's nearly four-month high of 115. 
Lam said fines for breaches of the new rules could be doubled to at least HK$4,000 ($516).
The latest rise in cases has also led to the postponement for at least two weeks of a travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore - which was due to be launched on Nov. 22. 

Having once had the highest COVID-19 rates in Southeast Asia, Singapore has all but eradicated the virus and has the world's lowest fatality rate with just 28 deaths.

Fakhrizadeh, long suspected by Western and Israeli government of masterminding a secret nuclear weapons program, was ambushed on a highway near Tehran on Friday and gunned down in his car.
Iran's clerical and military rulers have blamed the Islamic Republic's longtime enemy, Israel, for the killing. Iran has in the past accused Israel of killing several Iranian nuclear scientists since 2010.
State TV showed Fakhrizadeh's coffin, wrapped by an Iranian flag in a ceremony at the defence ministry, where only several dozen senior military commanders and his family attended due to coronavirus precautions. 
""The enemies know and I, as a soldier, tell them that no crime, no terror and no stupid act will go unanswered by the Iranian people,"" said Defence Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami in a televised speech at the ceremony.
His body was later transferred to the Emamzade Saleh cemetery in northern Tehran for burial. 
Iran's semi-official Fars news agency said on Sunday Fakhrizadeh was assassinated by an automatic machine gun operated with a remote control. Witnesses on Friday told state TV that there were gunmen on the ground. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has declined to comment on the killing. An Israeli cabinet minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, said on Saturday he did not know who carried it out.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Monday found former president Chun Doo-hwan guilty of defaming a former democracy activist who was involved in protests against his government in the 1980s and handed him an eight-month suspended jail sentence.
The sentence was suspended for two years, meaning the 89-year-old former president is unlikely to spend any time in prison, the court ruling seen by Reuters showed.
Jung Ju-gyo, an attorney for Chun, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment and it is unclear whether he plans to appeal.
The trial was held in the southwestern city of Gwangju, where hundreds, possibly thousands, were believed to have been killed when local citizens rose up against Chun's authoritarian government on May 18, 1980 and were crushed by police, paratroopers and tanks.
Chun committed the defamation against Catholic priest and activist Cho Chul-hyun, also known as Cho Bi-oh in his 2017 memoirs, when Chun called Cho a ""despicable liar"" for testifying that government helicopters had fired on civilians, the ruling said. 
Cho died in 2016, but South Korea's strict defamation laws meant Chun faced up to two years in prison and up to 5 million won ($4,500) in fines.
In its ruling on Monday, the court said it found the reports of government helicopters firing on civilians to be reliable.
Chun, a general who seized power in a 1979 coup, was president until mass demonstrations led him to step down in 1988.
In 1995, he was accused of mutiny, treason and bribery, but he refused to appear at the prosecutors' office and instead travelled to his hometown. Then President Kim Young-sam ordered his arrest and Chun was detained on Dec. 3, 1995.
He was found guilty of mutiny, treason and corruption in August 1996. He was originally sentenced to death but was released, having spent just over two years at the Anyang Correctional Institution, near Seoul, in 1997 in an effort by Kim to promote ""national harmony"".

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The most prominent leaders of Thai anti-government protests presented themselves at a police station on Monday to hear charges of insulting the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, but said they would not be deterred from their demonstrations.
It is the first time in more than two years that anyone has been charged with lese majeste, Article 112 in the Thai criminal code, which can mean a jail sentence of up to 15 years.
""112 is an unjust law. I don't give it any value,"" rights lawyer and protest leader Arnon Nampa told reporters as he arrived at the police station. ""I am ready to fight in the justice system.""
Arnon was joined by Panupong ""Mike Rayong"" Jadnok, Panusaya ""Rung"" Sithijirawattanakul and Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak.
They did not say whether they would plead guilty. A total of seven protest leaders face royal insult charges. They and dozens of other protesters face other charges relating to demonstrations since July. 
The protests have become the biggest challenge to the monarchy in decades as they have broken taboos by openly criticising a monarchy that must be revered according to the constitution.
The Royal Palace has not commented since protests began. When asked about the protesters recently, the king said they were loved ""all the same"".
Protesters have called for the king's powers to be curbed so that he is clearly accountable under the constitution. They also seek to reverse changes that gave him control of the royal fortune and some army units.
Critics of the monarchy say it has enabled decades of domination by the military, which has carried out 13 successful coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who overthrew an elected government in 2014, had said in July that the lese majeste charges were not currently being used at the request of the king.
""Using 112 against all of us shows the world and Thai society that the monarchy is now the political opposition,"" Parit said.

Protesters seek the removal of Prayuth, accusing him of engineering last year's election to keep hold of power. He says the vote was fair. Protesters also want to replace the constitution, which was drawn up by Prayuth's former junta and then modified by the king.

As the world focussed on COVID-19 this year, the United Nations in August declared an outbreak in Yemen of the virus that can cause permanent paralysis, with children most at risk. 
Wild polio today is found only in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But in populations with low vaccination rates - common in remote parts of war-torn countries like Yemen - the weakened polio virus used in vaccines can circulate and mutate, also causing paralysis. This is called a vaccine-derived polio outbreak. 
Sanad, a volunteer, is taking part in a three-day campaign finishing Monday run by the World Health Organisation and U.N. children's agency UNICEF to vaccinate children across Houthi-controlled north Yemen.
The rest of Yemen, under the control of the internationally-recognised government, will be vaccinated next week, WHO representative Abdel Nasser said in Sanaa. The aim is to reach 5.5 million children under five. 
""We sometimes face the difficulty of families rejecting us. They hesitate to vaccinate, fearing that it is something dangerous, coming from outside. We try to convince them that this is nothing to be feared,"" said Sanad.
Travelling the streets in a minivan with a loudspeaker announcing the campaign, the team marks house doors with chalk to show where vaccines have and have not been administered as they move through narrow alleys and stairwells. 
The August outbreak was detected in the country's remote north-west, in areas not reached by vaccines for a long time, UNICEF said in September. 
""Significant challenges and delays in the shipment of stool samples from Yemen during the last two years have resulted in delayed detection ... Local impediments, including security, limit the application of internationally recommended protocol of house-to-house vaccination campaigns,"" UNICEF said. 

WHO's Nasser said health teams face big problems in distributing supplies for immunisations, but said all were working hard to keep up routine vaccinations.

Turkey withdrew Oruc Reis from contested waters ahead of a previous EU summit in October to ""allow for diplomacy"", but later sent it back after what it called unsatisfactory outcomes from the summit. Earlier this month, Turkey said Oruc Reis would operate in the region until Nov. 29.
The energy ministry said on Monday the vessel had completed a mission which started on Aug. 10. ""Our ship, which has collected 10,995 km of 2D seismic data, has returned to the Antalya port,"" it said in a tweet.
Refinitiv ship tracking data confirmed Oruc Reis was back in port in Antalya on Monday morning. The data also showed drill ship Yavuz in waters near Turkey's southern coast, while seismic survey vessel Barbaros Hayreddin Pasa was still out at sea south of Cyprus.
After weeks of tension, Ankara and Athens agreed to resume talks over their contested maritime claims in September, ending a 4-year hiatus. But Greece has since said it would not begin talks as long as Turkish vessels were in contested waters.
Last week, the EU's Parliament called for sanctions against Ankara over President Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Northern Cyprus and Turkish operations in the eastern Mediterranean, which it called illegal. Turkey said it fully rejected this.

EU leaders will meet on Dec. 11-12 to discuss the sanctions, with France leading a push in the bloc to sanction Turkey. Paris has yet to draw up sanctions, but diplomats say any measures would likely target areas of Turkey's economy linked to hydrocarbon exploration.

Debretsion Gebremichael, who heads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), also told Reuters in a text message that some Eritrean soldiers fighting alongside the Ethiopian federal forces had been taken prisoner by his side.
Billene Seyoum, the spokeswoman for the Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, told Reuters that responding to ""delusions of a criminal clique"" was not the government's focus.
There was no immediate comment from the Eritrean government, though at the start of the more than three-week conflict it had denied involvement.

Claims from all sides are difficult to verify since phone and internet links to Tigray region have been largely down and access tightly controlled since the war began on Nov. 4.

LONDON/MADRID (Reuters) - Want a cheap used car to nip around town without running the gauntlet of coronavirus on public transport? Welcome to Pandemic Motors, we have just what you need.
Across Europe, people are snapping up old bangers, clunkers, Klapperkasten, tacots and catorci, desperate to avoid buses and trains but wary of splashing out on a shiny new motor in uncertain economic times.
""Public transportation is terrific here, but with the COVID and all that, it's better to avoid it,"" said Robert Perez, who recently moved to Spain's capital Madrid from Argentina.
On the hunt for work, Perez, a 33-year-old automotive engineer, bought a red 2001 Seat Toledo for 2,000 euros ($2,370) from OcasionPlus, a Spanish used car firm that has opened four new dealerships since the lockdown due to soaring demand.
Data provided to Reuters by research firm IHS Markit and online car market AutoScout24 showed there has been a marked upward shift in registrations of older cars across Europe, as well as a spike in internet searches for ageing vehicles.
The surge in interest in used cars is neither good news for struggling mass transit networks nor the environment as dirty old cars appear to be more in demand than new electric vehicles.
In the longer term, however, the shift away from public transport towards ""individual mobility"" in the pandemic era is expected to help carmakers, hit by a 27% slump in new vehicle sales across Europe in the first 10 months of 2020.
At Nawaie Motoring's crammed lot in the west London suburb of Hayes, general manager Ameen Sultani points out the older cars selling for under 3,000 pounds ($3,985) that are in demand.
He said prices for the cars, mostly over a decade old, have jumped by 25% as buyers who used to take trains and buses look for affordable alternatives.
""Anything under 3,000 pounds has sold very quickly and is very hard to replace in our inventory because everyone is chasing the same vehicles,"" Sultani told Reuters. ""Most of them have bought because they wanted to avoid public transport.""

CHEAP CARS
Stronger than expected demand for new cars in the United States, Europe and especially China in recent months has helped major automakers recover to some extent from the financial blows pandemic lockdowns delivered in the spring.
But an analysis of car registration data in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom conducted for Reuters by IHS Markit also shows there's a significant shift toward older, used vehicles.
In France, for example, the IHS analysis showed used car registrations rose nearly 16% in the third quarter while new vehicle sales fell more than 5%. It also showed that in 2020 so far, vehicles over 15 years old made up a higher proportion of used car registrations than in 2019.
""It's fair to say in the time of corona that the amount of vehicles older than 15 years has increased versus prior years,"" said Bjoern Huetter, an associate product director at IHS.
There was an even bigger jump in Spain, with used car registrations up nearly 25%, according to the IHS analysis Cristian Lopez, 34, is another buyer in Spain who went for the cheaper second-hand option, partly thanks to having saved some money during the country's strict lockdown.
""Enough to buy a cheap car in cash!"" Lopez said.
Furloughed from his job at a catering company, he went back to school to study tourism management. This month, he bought a gray 2005  Renault  (PA:RENA) Clio for 3,600 euros to get to classes from his home in the Madrid suburb of Vicalvaro.
Vehicle sales portal Sumauto, part of Spanish media company Vocento SA, told Reuters that sales of cars over 20 years old jumped 25% in Spain from June to October, while those over 15 years old rose 16%.

'INDIVIDUAL MOBILITY'
In an analysis for Reuters, online car market AutoScout24, which serves Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, said internet searches for older cars had spiked since the summer.
The data showed, for instance, that in July through September, online searches for vehicles over 20 years old jumped 80% in France, 77% in the Netherlands and 59% in Belgium. 
AutoScout24 Chief Executive Edgar Berger said that while ""individual mobility"" had become more important to consumers in these markets because of the pandemic, they had also become more cautious because of economic uncertainty.
But buyers are still shying away from second-hand electric vehicles, according to used car dealer OcasionPlus. Of the 2,800 vehicles it currently has on sale, only six are electric.
""People are wary about batteries' performance in the long run and are reluctant to invest in the charging cabling for a second-hand car,"" marketing chief Fernando Rodriguez said.
Besides the potential setback to ambitious European targets for cutting carbon emissions, there are other, longer-term ramifications from keeping very old cars on the road longer.
Older vehicles with fewer safety features might cause more accidents and lead to higher premiums, insurers said, though that will take time to show up in statistics.
And the shift to cars is already hitting public transport. 
The number of people using public transport in Spain fell 92% in April from the same month in 2019 and was still 44% lower in September, several months after national lockdown restrictions were eased.
For a graphic on Britain's pandemic car use versus rail:
https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-EUROPE/USED/nmopadogjva/chart.png
In Britain, before the country's latest lockdown began at the beginning of November, rail usage was about a third of 2019 levels, while personal car usage was close to 90%. 
In September, London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for a 5.7 billion pound bailout package for the city's transport operator as passenger numbers continued to plunge.
Germany and France have also bailed out their state-owned railways.
Greenpeace political campaigner Sam Chetan-Welsh said the shift away from public transport was a greater environmental concern than having older cars on the road because higher sales of new, larger sports-utility vehicles have left vehicle emissions relatively flat anyway.

""Governments need to do everything they can to reduce traffic on the road,"" Chetan-Welsh said. ""That includes giving people the confidence to get back on public transport safely.""

Two officers would stay in custody, while the other two were placed under judicial control, the news providers added.
Charges against the officers would include the use of racist language and intentional violence with weapons, Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz had said on Sunday.
Violent clashes broke out in the French capital on Saturday during a demonstration against police violence, following President Emmanuel Macron's comments the previous day that the images of the alleged beating brought shame to France.
The alleged victim, music producer Michel Zecler, said police jumped on him at his music studio in Paris' 17th arrondissement on Nov. 21.
He said he had been walking nearby without a mask, a violation of French health protocols regarding the coronavirus, and upon seeing a police car, went into his music studio to avoid being fined.
However, the police followed him inside and started to physically attack him and racially abuse him, he added.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prime minister said a fake image of an Australian soldier posted on a Chinese official's Twitter account was ""truly repugnant"" and Canberra was demanding it be taken down, amid deteriorating relations between the two countries.
Scott Morrison called a media briefing to condemn the posting of the image, which depicted an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child, and said Canberra was seeking an apology from Beijing.
The Australian government has asked Twitter to remove the tweet, posted on Monday by China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, Morrison said. 
""It is utterly outrageous and cannot be justified on any basis,"" Morrison said. ""The Chinese government should be utterly ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes."" 
Australia's relationship with China has deteriorated since Canberra called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Earlier this month, China outlined a list of grievances about Australia's foreign investment, national security and human rights policy, saying Canberra needed to correct its actions to restore the bilateral relationship with its largest trading partner.
Morrison said countries around the world were watching how Beijing responded to tensions in Australia's relationship with China.
In the latest in a series of trade sanctions, China announced on Friday it will impose temporary anti-dumping tariffs of up to 212.1% on wine imported from Australia, a move Canberra has labelled unjustified and linked to diplomatic grievances.
Australia has told 13 special forces soldiers they face dismissal in relation to an independent report on alleged unlawful killings in Afghanistan, the head of the country’s army said on Friday.
Zhao wrote on Twitter: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.""
His Twitter account had posted the same message, but without the fake image of the soldier and child, on Friday.
Morrison said Australia had established a ""transparent and honest"" process for investigating the allegations against the accused soldiers and this ""is what a free, democratic, liberal country does"".

Australia had ""patiently sought"" to address tensions in the relationship with China and wanted direct discussion between ministers, he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Prime Minister Scott Morrison became Australia's first leader on Monday to make an appearance before parliament by video link, as he spends time in quarantine following a recent trip to Japan.
While not the first such session by a world leader, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson having addressed parliament online, Morrison spoke to Australian lawmakers on a big screen television placed at the back of the House of Representatives.
Morrison, who last week became the first world leader to meet Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, spoke on the coronavirus, which Australia has largely contained, and aspects of the country's economic recovery.
""Our relative success here in Australia sometimes shields us from the sheer scale of the devastation that has occurred elsewhere,"" he said in comments that had been delayed a few minutes by technical issues.
Monday marked 24 hours with no new locally acquired infections for Australia, though its death toll rose to 908 after disease complications killed one person in southeastern Victoria state who had earlier been cleared of infection.
Australia's tally of more than 27,800 infections is far fewer than many other developed countries.
With infections curtailed, authorities in Victoria said they would resume a system of hotel quarantine for locals returning from overseas.
The state had barred entry to Australians returning home following an outbreak of more than 20,000 cases sparked by infections among hotel workers caught from those in mandatory 14-day quarantine. 
Many of the workers, who had second jobs, then carried the virus further in the community. 
The outbreak was only contained after a stringent lockdown for more than 100 days in the state capital of Melbourne, home to about 5 million people.

99,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2020 10:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Twitter suspends Thai royalist account linked to influence campaign,"By Matthew Tostevin and Patpicha Tanakasempipat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Twitter has suspended a Thai pro-royalist account linked to the palace that a Reuters analysis found was connected to thousands of others created in recent weeks spreading posts in favour of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and the monarchy.
The Reuters review found tens of thousands of tweets that an expert said appeared to be from accounts amplifying royalist messaging in a push to counter a months-long protest movement that has swelled from opposing the government to breaking a longstanding taboo by challenging the monarchy.
Internal army training documents reviewed by Reuters showed evidence of a coordinated information campaign designed to spread favourable information and discredit opponents.
The pro-monarchy @jitarsa_school account was suspended after Reuters sought comment on Wednesday from Twitter on the recent royalist campaign on the social media platform, where protesters have long had a strong presence.
Protesters and royalists have cited the importance of social media in propelling the protest movement, which has become the biggest challenge in decades to the monarchy as well as the government of former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha.
Created in September, the @jitarsa_school account had more than 48,000 followers before its suspension.
""The account in question was suspended for violating our rules on spam and platform manipulation,"" a Twitter representative said on Sunday. She said the suspension was in line with the company's policies and not a result of the Reuters request for comment.
The account's profile had said that it trained people for the Royal Volunteers programme, which is run by the Royal Office. A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page for the Royal Volunteers School, which posts pro-monarchy videos and news of the programme, also identifies the Twitter account as its own.
Neither the school nor the Royal Volunteers headquarters responded to requests for comment on the suspension. The ""Volunteer Spirit 904"" programme was established during the current king's reign, which began in 2016, to build loyalty to the monarchy.
The palace did not respond to a request for comment. It has a policy of not speaking to media and has not commented since the start of protests in July that initially targeted the government before breaking taboos by calling for curbs to the king's powers.
ROYALIST FIGHTBACK
In recent weeks, royalist hashtags have begun trending on Twitter, an important platform for opponents of the government even before protests began in July.
The Reuters analysis found that more than 80% of the accounts following @jitarsa_school had also been created since the start of September. A sample of 4,600 of the recently created accounts showed that all they did was promote the royalist hashtags - an indication of the kind of activity that would not be associated with regular Twitter users.
For a graphic on Thai royalist Twitter account's new followers:
https://graphics.reuters.com/THAILAND-PROTESTS/ROYALISTS/dgkvlaekqpb/chart.png
A sample of 559 retweets of the account's tweets were virtually all from accounts with bot-like characteristics, according to research by social media consultancy Drone Emprit for Reuters.
""Government forces have been trying to counter the protesters,"" said Saijai Liangpunsakul of the independent Social Media Monitoring for Peace group. ""Twitter has taken down some accounts, but there are many more.""
Hashtags promoted by the suspended account, usually alongside pictures of the king and other royals, included those that translate as: #StopViolatingTheMonarchy, #ProtectTheMonarchy, #WeLoveTheMotherOfTheLand, #WeLoveTheMonarchy and #MinionsLoveTheMonarchy.
Royalist group leader Warong Dechgitvigrom declined to comment on the account's suspension, saying he was unaware of it.
He told Reuters there were more pro-monarchy messages on Twitter because royalists increasingly recognised the need to counter protesters' messages and had encouraged each another to join the platform. 
""Pro-monarchy hashtags are authentic, born out of true feelings,"" he said.
PROTESTERS ACCUSED BY ROYALISTS
Royalists have accused protesters of inauthentic activity on Twitter, with coordinated campaigns around hashtags.
But Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak, one of the protest leaders, said protesters using the platform were genuine and he welcomed the suspension of the pro-royalist account.
""They're not recruited to trend hashtags like the army and they don't use taxpayers' money,"" he said.
Although not directly linked to the @jitarsa_school account, a 28-page army document reviewed by Reuters showed an organised information operation to target ""opponents"" and spread pro-monarchy messages on Twitter. 
The document says 17,562 Twitter accounts run by 9,743 army officers are split into a ""White Team"" and a ""Grey/Black Team"" that were instructed to tweet with coordinated hashtags, as well as to like, retweet and follow one another.
The document suggests measures to appear more like authentic accounts.
The army on Saturday acknowledged the document is genuine, saying in a Facebook post it was used in a training session to strengthen the army's public relations efforts. 
In early October, Twitter announced it had taken down 926 accounts linked to the Thai army for violating its platform-manipulation policies by amplifying pro-government content and targeting political opposition figures. 

The army at the time denied that the accounts belonged to army officials.

The dip in ratings follows criticism over his hesitation to suspend a domestic travel campaign as new coronavirus infections rise, and potentially threatens the chances of his premiership extending beyond next autumn, when his current term ends.
Suga's approval ratings were at 63% in the previous poll conducted in October. 
Respondents who disapproved of the government's coronavirus countermeasures rose 13 percentage points to 48%, topping the 44% who thought the government was doing well, according to the same poll.
In the survey of 993 people, 61% agreed with the government's decision to partially halt the domestic 'Go To' travel campaign, while 25% said the government needed to do more.
Although Japan has been spared the high incidence of the disease seen in Europe and the United State, infections rates are rising as the cold season approaches, with the nation reaching record numbers of daily cases in recent weeks.
New daily infections surged to an all-time high of 2,684 people on Saturday, according to public broadcaster NHK. The number of deaths stands at over 2,100. 
The government has been attempting to keep the coronavirus under control while boosting Japan's hard-hit economy with a national travel campaign that subsidises tourism. 

With new cases rising, the government scaled back on the tourism campaign last week by excluding the two cities of Osaka and Sapporo, but has not suspended the programme in Tokyo, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's workplace regulator has filed charges against 13 parties following an investigation into a volcanic eruption on White Island in 2019 which killed 22 people.
A surprise eruption on the White Island, also known by its Maori name of Whakaari, on Dec 9 last year, killed 22 people and injured dozens. 
Majority of them were tourists from countries like Australia, the United States and Malaysia who were part of a cruise ship that was travelling around New Zealand. There were 47 people on the island when the volcano erupted.
Worksafe, New Zealand's primary regulator for workplace related incidents, said in a news conference its investigations found 13 parties had not met their health and safety obligations in taking the tourists to the White island. 
""This was an unexpected event, but that does not mean it was unforeseeable and there is a duty on operators to protect those in their care.” said WorkSafe Chief Executive Phil Parkes.
Worksafe has charged 10 organisations under the Health and Safety at Work Act with each charge carrying a maximum fine of NZ$1.5 million ($1.06 million).
Three individuals were charged as directors or individuals who were required to exercise due diligence to ensure the company meets its health and safety obligations. These charges each carry a maximum fine of $300,000.
WorkSafe did not name those charged as they may seek suppression orders in their first appearance in court on Dec 15.
The agency said it had not investigated the rescue and recovery following the eruption, as that is the subject of a coronial inquest which is underway. 
At the time of the eruption questions were raised why people were allowed on the island, a popular destination for day-trippers, given there was reportedly a heightened risk of an eruption.

102,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>","U.S. to Add China’s SMIC, CNOOC to Blacklist, Reuters Says","(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is poised to add chipmaker SMIC and offshore oil-and-gas explorer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) to a list of firms blocked from American investment due to military ties, Reuters reported, in the latest U.S. swipe at Beijing before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. are among four Chinese companies to be added to a list of firms owned or controlled by the military, Reuters reported, citing a document seen and three unidentified people familiar with the matter. Their addition -- along with China Construction Technology Co. Ltd. and China International Engineering Consulting Corp. -- would bring the total number of firms on the blacklist to 35.
It wasn’t clear when the new list would be published in the Federal Register, Reuters said. The Defense Department didn’t respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
CNOOC didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment. Cnooc Ltd., the company’s listed unit, fell as much as 9.3% in Hong Kong. China Oilfield Services Ltd., its drilling subsidiary, fell as much as 11%.
“There will be huge impact on the company because the oil-and-gas value chain involves a lot of U.S. companies from upstream, mid-stream all the way to the gas side,” said Sengyick Tee, an analyst with SIA Energy. “This also means they cannot procure parts and software from U.S. companies.”
President Donald Trump, a Republican, has continued to roll out punitive measures against China despite losing the U.S. presidential election earlier this month to Biden, a Democrat. The actions will make it harder for the incoming administration to de-escalate tensions with Beijing, although they will also arguably give the U.S. side more leverage in future negotiations.
In a related executive order earlier this month, the U.S. said China was “increasingly exploiting” American capital for “the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses,” posing a threat to the U.S. That order prohibits investment firms and pension funds from buying and selling shares of 31 Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon since June as having military ties.
In response to the previous order, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of “viciously slandering” its military-civilian integration policies and vowed to protect the country’s companies. “This not only severely harms the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, but also the interests of foreign investors including U.S. ones,” ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at the time, urging the order’s withdrawal.
Exxon, Shell (LON:RDSa)
State-owned CNOOC, the country’s main deepwater oil and gas explorer, has ties to key global energy producers and projects. The firm is among  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).’s partners in its Guyana project, owns a stake in a Royal Dutch Shell Plc LNG export terminal in Australia, and has a share in the U.K. North Sea’s Buzzard oil field.
CNOOC’s main base of operations are the coastal waters surrounding China, which account for more than 60% of its listed company’s production, with the majority coming from the Bohai Sea near Beijing.
Operations in the South China Sea, which account for about 29% of output, have at times run into controversy because China claims drilling rights in waters far from its borders, and within 200 miles of countries like Vietnam and the Philippines. The firm also owns interests in shale and deepwater projects in the U.S., accounting for production of about 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, according to its website.
SMIC was little changed after falling as much as 0.9% earlier. A company representative referred request for comment to a prior statement denying military connections.
SMIC Restrictions
In September, the U.S. Commerce Department separately imposed export restrictions on SMIC, requiring American firms to apply for a license to send certain products to China’s largest chipmaker. SMIC and its subsidiaries present “an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end use,” the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security wrote.
SMIC represents a cornerstone in China’s vision of creating its own, world-class semiconductor industry, which the Communist Party sees as an essential foundation for a self-sufficient technology sector. The company is the country’s biggest contract manufacturer of chipsets and raised more than $7 billion to expand in a Shanghai stock offering in July.
SMIC still has far to go to catch up to rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s most advanced smartphones. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, is commercializing 5 nanometer technology, at least two generations ahead of SMIC’s capabilities.
A Trump administration blacklisting would make that effort more difficult -- if not impossible -- because SMIC could be barred from American suppliers, which tend to make the most advanced chip-making equipment.

KABUL (Reuters) - Soraya Shahidy carefully lays a stencil on Nargis Merzayi's arm before inking the latest tattoo in her salon in Afghanistan's capital Kabul.
A normal routine in studios around the world, Shahidy's artwork in the conservative country breaks a tattoo taboo: she believes she is the first female tattoo artist in a country where some religious scholars say tattoos are forbidden under Islam.
""I could have performed this profession abroad but I wanted to do it in Afghanistan because there are no female tattoo artists in the country,"" she told Reuters. ""I believe it's not only men who can apply tattoos. Women can do it too.""
Shahidy, 27, who trained in Turkey and Iran, insists her artwork is legitimate in Islam.
""Some mullahs say tattoos are forbidden, but there are other mullahs who say the opposite,"" she said, adding that Kabul is seeing a small but growing demand from young people for tattoos.
""Most clients want tattoos on their wrists, arms, neck and legs... Girls are more interested in delicate tattoo designs such as flowers, butterflies and dragonflies, or the names of people they love. But some boys choose designs that are extravagant to me.""
One client, she said, wanted a tattoo of a tombstone inscribed ""volunteer of death"".
Shahidy's current client, Merzayi, was long interested in getting a tattoo and finally decided to go ahead with a design on the inside of her forearm.
""My tattoo is in Hindi handwriting and it means courage,"" she said. 
Like many in the country, Shahidy thinks about the possibility of a return to power by the Taliban, who are in peace talks with the Afghan government to end two decades of war. But she expressed confidence the country has changed dramatically since the hardline Islamists were ousted in 2001.
""We are not the people who can easily lose the achievements we have gained over the recent years,"" she said.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Communist-run Cuba over the weekend launched an all-out rhetorical assault through state-run media on a rare protest that took place Friday for freedom of expression, branding it part of an ongoing effort by the United States to create an uprising.
The Friday stakeout around the culture ministry of around 300 creatives was sparked by authorities' crackdown on the San Isidro Movement of dissident artists and activists that formed two years ago to protest curbs on freedom of expression.
The protest ended before dawn on Saturday only after officials met with 30 of the demonstrators and agreed to continue talking and to urgently review the case of a detained member of the San Isidro crew and a rapper sentenced this month to eight months in jail on charges of contempt. It also agreed to ensure independent artists in the future were not harassed. 
But just hours later the government called in the top U.S. diplomat on the island, charge de affairs Timothy Zúñiga-Brown, for a scolding over ""grave interference in Cuba's internal affairs"" as state television ran a 90-minute special attacking the rapper and other dissident artists and broadcasting visuals of their interactions with U.S. diplomats and Miami exiles.
""Sovereign Cuba accepts no interference ... The revolutionary ones will fight back,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in one of a series of Twitter posts accusing the San Isidro movement of being a ""reality show"" on social media created by ""U.S. imperialists.""
Diaz-Canel said much the same at a pro-government rally Sunday of a few thousand young people.
""In less than 24 hours the Culture Ministry has broken three of the five accords,"" performance artists Tania Bruguera said at a Sunday news conference held by some of those who participated in the talks with the government.
Most present at the press conference denounced continued harassment of dissent and the branding of their efforts as a CIA plot, though they also expressed hope the dialogue would continue as promised.
Friday's protest came after authorities besieged the movement's headquarters in Old Havana's San Isidro district on Thursday, breaking up a hunger strike there that had started to gain international attention.
Security forces forcibly removed and briefly detained the five members on hunger strike and nine other people in the house, citing violations of coronavirus protocols.
""We support the Cuban people in their struggle for liberty,"" Jake Sullivan, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's national security adviser wrote on Twitter.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine justice officials on Sunday seized medical files from the doctor of Diego Maradona as part of their investigation into the recent death of the soccer star.
Maradona died at age 60 on Wednesday after a heart attack.
The search was requested by prosecutors in the rich Buenos Aires suburb of San Isidro. The prosecutor's office said in a statement that no charges had been brought against the doctor, Leopoldo Luque, or anyone else, but the probe would continue.
""We have started to analyze the material that was taken"" from Luque's home and office, the statement said. It did not provide information on what prompted the probe. 
""They took the clinical files,"" Luque told reporters.
""There was no medical error,"" Luque said, adding that he was not responsible for the death of the soccer player who catapulted to international fame and semi-divine status at home after leading the Argentine team that won the 1986 World Cup.
In later years, Maradona struggled with substance abuse issues. ""Diego was tired, tired of being 'Maradona'"", Luque said.
The player's lawyer, Matias Moria, on Thursday said he would ask for a full investigation of the circumstances of the soccer legend's death, criticizing what he said was a slow response by emergency service. 
""The ambulance took more than half an hour to arrive, which was criminal idiocy,"" Matias said on Thursday in a Twitter post. 
Luque said faster ambulance service would not have saved Maradona's life. ""You would have needed medical equipment at his house, including a respirator,"" he told reporters.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stressed the need to carry out economic policies with responsibility, as he presided over a meeting of the politburo of the ruling Workers Party, state news agency KCNA reported on Monday.
The meeting comes during a tough year for North Korea as the coronavirus pandemic has put more pressure on an economy already battered by international sanctions aimed at stopping its nuclear program.
The politburo harshly criticized the economic guidance organs for failing to provide scientific guidance for economic tasks ahead of a congress next year, KCNA reported. 
""It stressed the need to put the operation and command for carrying out the Party's economic policies on a scientific basis and display great dedication and responsibility,"" said KCNA.
In August, Kim said the ruling party would hold a congress in January to decide on a new five-year plan, with a party meeting noting serious delays in improving the national economy.
North Korea embarked on an 80-day campaign in October to attain its goals in every sector before next year's congress.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah on Sunday met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and both leaders set high hopes that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden will revive peace talks over a two-state solution to the decades-old Arab-Israeli conflict, officials said.
In a palace statement after meeting with Abbas in the Red Sea port of Aqaba, the monarch, who in recent months said Israeli policies and Trump's Middle East peace plan would lead to conflict, said he fully backed Palestinian statehood. 
""His Majesty stressed Jordan stood with all its resources alongside Palestinians in achieving their legitimate rights to set up an independent state,"" the monarch was quoted as saying in the statement. 
In his first conversation with an Arab leader since his election earlier this month, Biden spoke with King Abdullah last week, telling the monarch that he hopes to cooperate on “supporting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""
The Trump administration has reversed decades of U.S. policy on the conflict, refraining from endorsing the two-state solution, the longtime international formula which envisages a Palestinian state co-existing with Israel.
Diplomats say the monarch, a staunch U.S. ally who was among the first Arab leaders to congratulate Biden, saw Trump's policies sidelining the kingdom's once pivotal role in Arab-Israeli peacemaking by full backing of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing policies.
Trump's peace plan was also seen as posing an existentialist threat to Jordan with the demise of a Palestinian state through the annexation of large parts of the West Bank pushing the kingdom to become an alternative state for Palestinians.
Jordan, which lost the West Bank including East Jerusalem to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, lies at the heart of the conflict with many of its more than 7 million citizens of Palestinian origin.
In another joint communique with Abbas, both leaders said Israel ""attempts to impose new realities"" by annexing and accelerating settlement building in occupied Palestinian territory.
The Trump administration had also enraged Jordan and Arabs when it said it no longer viewed Israel’s settlements in the West Bank as “inconsistent with international law.""

Abbas, who three years ago cut off contact with the Trump administration, accusing it of pro-Israel bias, on Monday will head to Cairo to seek its support for a revival of peace talks based on a two-state solution, diplomats said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and his team are headed to Saudi Arabia and Qatar this week for talks in a region simmering with tension after the killing of an Iranian nuclear scientist.
A senior administration official said on Sunday that Kushner is to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Saudi city of Neom, and the emir of Qatar in that country in the coming days. Kushner will be joined by Middle East envoys Avi Berkowitz and Brian Hook and Adam Boehler, chief executive of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.
Kushner and his team helped negotiate normalization deals between Israel and Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Sudan since August. The official said they would like to advance more such agreements before President Donald Trump hands power to President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20. 
U.S. officials believe enticing Saudi Arabia into a deal with Israel would prompt other Arab nations to follow suit. But the Saudis do not appear to be on the brink of reaching such a landmark deal and officials in recent weeks have been focusing on other countries, with concern about Iran's regional influence a uniting factor.
Kushner's trip comes after the killing on Friday of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in Tehran by unidentified assailants. Western and Israeli governments believe Fakhrizadeh was the architect of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program.
Days before the killing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Saudi Arabia and met with bin Salman, an Israeli official said, in what was the first publicly confirmed visit by an Israeli leader. Israeli media said they were joined by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The historic meeting underlined how opposition to Tehran is bringing about a strategic realignment of countries in the Middle East. Bin Salman and Netanyahu fear Biden will adopt policies on Iran similar to those adopted during Barack Obama's U.S. presidency which strained Washington's ties with its traditional regional allies. Biden has said he will rejoin the international nuclear pact with Iran that Trump quit in 2018 - and work with allies to strengthen its terms - if Tehran first resumes strict compliance.
The senior administration official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, declined to give more details of Kushner's trip for security reasons.
The official said Kushner met at the White House last week with the Kuwaiti foreign minister, Sheikh Ahmad Nasser Al-Mohammad Al-Sabah. Kuwait is seen as critical in any effort to resolve a three-year rift between Qatar and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, which comprise the GCC, cut diplomatic ties with Qatar in 2017 and imposed a boycott over allegations that Qatar supported terrorism, a charge it denies.

TIKRIT, Iraq (Reuters) - A rocket hit a small oil refinery in northern Iraq on Sunday, causing a fire at a fuel storage tank and forcing a complete shutdown of operations after the blaze spread to a nearby pipeline network, two refinery officials said.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for attacking the Siniya refinery, in a statement posted on the group's official channel.
It said two Katyusha rockets were used in the attack. It gave no further details on any casualties.
A spokesman for the state-run Northern Refineries Co, which manages a number of Iraqi refineries, earlier told Iraq's state news agency that two rockets had hit the Siniya refinery, causing a fire that it said had been controlled.
Officials said halting operations at the Siniya refinery, which has refining capacity of 30,000 barrels per day, was a safety measure to prevent further damage. 
""We completely shut down production units to avoid extensive damage that could result,"" a chief engineer at the refinery said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
An oil ministry statement said firefighters managed to put out the fire at a fuel tank and cited Deputy Oil Minister Hamid Younis as saying that operations are expected to be resumed in ""the next few hours after assessing the damage"".
Sunday's attack signals that Islamic State militants are still capable of launching attacks against security forces and vital energy sites, despite being defeated during a 2014-2017 U.S.-backed military campaign.
There were no reports of casualties at the facility, which is near Iraq's largest oil refinery of Baiji in the Northern Salahuddin province.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has issued an arrest warrant for a former security minister wanted on corruption charges and may request his extradition from the United States where he is being held awaiting trial, an official told Reuters.
Ex-Security Minister Genaro Garcia Luna pled not guilty last month to U.S. charges involving a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme allegedly designed to boost the Sinaloa cartel once headed by jailed drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
The new arrest warrant was issued on Friday and resulted from a charge of illegal enrichment in Mexico, according to an official with the attorney general's office. 
The charge stems from Garcia Luna's inability to show that more than $1 million in property acquisitions in Mexico were made lawfully, the official said. 
""We already have an arrest warrant against Garcia Luna and we're studying the viability of requesting and starting his extradition process,"" the official said.
Milenio newspaper reported earlier on Sunday that an extradition request would follow the conclusion of the former minister's trial in the United States. Reuters was not able to confirm that.
Mexico's foreign ministry, responsible for making extradition requests, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Garcia Luna is accused of taking suitcases of cash from the Sinaloa cartel to ensure safe passage for its drugs as well as passing on information about its rivals.
He was arrested in late 2019 in Dallas and is currently being held in New York awaiting trial.

His indictment has roiled Mexico's political establishment, marking the first time such a senior security figure had been charged with aiding one of the country's most powerful criminal organizations.

PARIS (Reuters) - Three Paris police officers being held over the beating of a Black music producer during an arrest a week ago will remain in custody for now, Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said on Sunday.
Heitz told a press briefing that judicial authorities wanted to make sure that the three did not have any contact with one another and that they could not exert any pressure on witnesses. 
The minutes-long beating of producer Michel Zecler was recorded on CCTV and has been widely circulated on social media, sparking an outcry in the national and foreign press and demonstrations against police violence across the country on Friday and Saturday.
President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that the images were shameful for France.
Prosecutor Heitz said the officers would be charged with intentional violence with weapons, the use of racist language, falsifying police records, violation of a private home and intentional damage to a private home.
A fourth police officer, who is not accused of taking part in the beating but of throwing a tear gas grenade into Zecler's music studio, would be suspended from active service and placed under judicial control, Heitz said.
Heitz said that during a hearing by investigators, the three police officers admitted to having beaten Zecler but said they did so because they could not subdue him as he was resisting arrest and because they were panicking. 
Heitz added that the officers denied using racist language against Zecler, but said that one of several young people who was in the basement studio - and who have also been heard by investigators - confirmed having heard the racist insults.
Laurent-Franck Lienard, a lawyer for the three police officers, said on BFM television that he too had been shocked by the images of the beating and said he was thinking ""have they gone crazy?"".
But he said that the three officers believed the arrest had been handled correctly and that force had to be used when unavoidable. 
He said his clients should not remain in custody. ""Preventive detention is totally hysterical,"" he said.
Zecler's lawyer Hafida El-Ali said on BFM ""They (the police officers) are lying at every level.""

After voting in local elections in Rio de Janeiro, Bolsonaro, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, said he had heard the U.S. vote was rigged, but presented no evidence. 
""I have sources and they said there was a lot of fraud,"" Bolsonaro said of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3. ""Whether it was enough to change the result, I don't know.""
Bolsonaro also questioned the legitimacy of Brazil's electoral process, decrying its electronic voting system and calling for a return to paper voting.
""You need to have a more reliable way to vote and the count has to be public,"" he said. ""You cannot have half a dozen people count the vote nationwide,"" he said of protocols currently in place for consolidating the ballots. 
Despite Democrat Joe Biden winning the U.S. presidential race with 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232, Bolsonaro and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador are two rare heads of state who have not recognized Biden's victory. 

On Sunday, Trump's chances of overturning the election result appeared to dwindle as he questioned whether the U.S. Supreme Court would ever hear a case airing his unproven claims of widespread voter fraud, and senior U.S. Republicans said a transition to a Biden presidency looked inevitable.

115,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",Turkey's COVID curfew fails to contain surging second wave,"By Irem Koca
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Coronavirus deaths in Turkey rose to a record for the seventh consecutive day on Sunday and the number of new cases remained high despite efforts by President Tayyip Erdogan's government to contain a second wave of infections.
Turkey is expected to report this week that its economy bounced back from a sharp coronavirus-induced slump earlier this year. But that recovery, key to Erdogan's sustained political support, could be threatened by the new outbreak.
The government introduced tighter measures a week ago including nightly curfews at weekends, restrictions on movements of people of non-working age, a move to online schooling and limiting restaurants and cafes to takeaway services. 
However the moves have done little to halt a remorseless rise in cases and fatalities, with Sunday's toll of 185 dead 45% above the peak of the first wave in April, and the number of new cases behind only the United States, India and Brazil - all countries with far larger populations than Turkey.
More than 29,000 cases were reported in the last 24 hours. Saturday's figure of 30,103 was the highest recorded, but authorities have only been including asymptomatic cases - as most other countries have regularly done - since Wednesday.
Doctors and opposition politicians have called for stricter measures, but with shops, restaurants and hotels already hit by the new clampdown, the government is anxious to avoid further economic pain and said people had a personal duty to cooperate. 
""Our health army is under a heavy burden,"" Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Twitter. ""Each of us is responsible for following the measures.""
(Graphic: Turkey's COVID-19 death toll hits new records, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/TURKEY-DEATHS/jznvnnlwmvl/chart.png)
Speaking after midday prayers on Friday, Erdogan attributed the resurgent pandemic to people flouting regulations. 
""Masks and (social) distance are very important, hygiene is very important. As long as these are not heeded, especially in big cities, the increasing continuation of (the virus) becomes inevitable,"" he told reporters.
Opponents say the government needs to take tougher action.
""The lives lost are our lives. But we see that the government is still trying to manage the situation with band-aid measures,"" Meral Aksener, leader of the opposition IYI Party, said in parliament last week. 
""I am calling out to Mr Erdogan from here once again - come, impose a quarantine of at least 14 days.""
Celallettin Koruturk, a specialist chest surgeon at an Istanbul hospital, echoed the call for stricter measures, saying that if the steps taken last weekend were going to be effective, they would have made a difference by now.

""Based on current data, we look to be at the top of the worldwide list of cases per population,"" he told Reuters. ""We need to act very dynamically without waiting further.""

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said hospitals in Mekelle are running low on supplies such as gloves to care for the wounded, and one hospital is lacking body bags for the dead. An ICRC statement did not give any numbers for the dead and wounded, but said the situation was ""quiet"" on Sunday.
The government has not said if there were casualties in its offensive to take the city. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been trying to quell a rebellion by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a powerful ethnically-based party that dominated the central government for nearly three decades before Abiy came to power in 2018. 
He said on Saturday evening federal troops had taken control of Mekelle within hours of launching an offensive there, allaying fears of protracted fighting in the city of 500,000 people. 
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael later told Reuters in a series of text messages that his forces were withdrawing from around the city but would fight on, raising the spectre of a drawn-out guerrilla war.
Thousands of people are believed to have been killed and nearly 44,000 have fled to neighbouring Sudan since fighting began on Nov. 4. 
The conflict has been another test for Abiy, who is trying to hold together a patchwork of ethnic groups that make up Ethiopia's 115 million people. The flow of refugees and attacks by the TPLF on neighbouring Eritrea have also threatened to destabilize the wider Horn of Africa region. 
Claims from all sides are difficult to verify since phone and internet links to Tigray have been down and access tightly controlled since fighting erupted this month.
The prime minister, who refers to the three-week-old conflict as an internal law and order matter, has rebuffed international offers of mediation. He said federal police would try to arrest TPLF ""criminals"" and bring them to court.
Late on Saturday, police issued arrest warrants for 17 more military officers charged with crimes including treason and embezzlement of public properties, state-affiliated Fana TV reported. Arrest warrants have already been issued for 117 senior officers with alleged ties to the TPLF since the conflict began. 
'STABILIZATION'
Lieutenant General Bacha Debele told Fana TV on Sunday that the military was engaged in “stabilization activities"", including assisting people displaced by the fighting to return to their villages.
It was not clear if any TPLF leaders had surrendered or been apprehended since Saturday. Their whereabouts and plans were also unknown. 
Asked by Reuters on Saturday if the TPLF would continue fighting, Debretsion replied in a text message: “Certainly. This is about defending our right to self determination.”
Ethiopian state TV broadcast footage on Sunday of federal troops in a location it did not specify clapping and cheering. Residents in five towns in Amhara region, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, took to the streets to show support for the military, state-run Amhara Mass Media Agency reported.
Regional diplomats and experts have said a rapid military victory in Mekelle might not signal the end of the conflict.
“Tigray’s leadership has vowed to fight on and, although it’s not clear how depleted Tigrayan security forces are by the conflict, armed resistance to federal rule may well be backed by much of the regional government and party apparatus, including local militia, as well as by other Tigrayan nationalist elements,” Will Davison, a senior analyst on Ethiopia at the International Crisis Group think tank, told Reuters on Sunday.
The TPLF has a history of guerrilla resistance. Tigray's mountainous terrain and borders with Sudan and Eritrea helped the group during its long struggle against Marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, whom it eventually toppled in 1991. 
The TPLF and Eritrean forces fought together against Mengistu and Eritrea secured its independence with his departure but relations soured soon after. The two nations went to war over a border dispute in 1998-2000.
Abiy won a Nobel Peace Prize last year for making peace with Eritrea, but the TPLF continues to regard the country as a mortal enemy. 
The head of the United Nations refugee agency said on Sunday that he hoped the government's promise to open humanitarian access to Tigray would happen as soon as possible.
EXPLOSIONS IN ERITREA'S CAPITAL
Six explosions were reported in the Eritrean capital Asmara on Saturday night, the U.S. State Department said in a statement, although it was not immediately clear if they were related to the Tigray conflict. The statement did not mention the cause or location of the explosions.
The TPLF has accused Eritrea of sending troops into Tigray in support of the Ethiopian government and fired rockets at its capital Asmara on Nov. 14..
Government officials in Asmara and Addis Ababa did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the latest explosions. Tigrayan forces also could not be reached. 
Abiy's government launched the offensive in Tigray after what it described as an attack by local forces on federal troops stationed there. 
The TPLF accuses Abiy of wanting to centralise control at the expense of Ethiopia's 10 regions, which exercise wide-ranging powers over matters like taxation and security. Abiy denies this.

Tensions escalated after Tigray held a regional election in September in defiance of the federal government, which had postponed voting nationwide in August because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which called the Tigray vote illegal

Thousands of protesters met at various locations, mostly in remote residential areas of the capital, and marched through the streets demanding the resignation of President Alexander Lukashenko, a witness said.
Police did not immediately answer calls seeking comment. 
Belarus has been in crisis since a presidential election in August that the opposition says was rigged, something Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years, denies.
""Get out, you and your OMON!"" chanted some of the protesters, using a short name for anti-riot police who have been accused of brutality against demonstrators.
Some cars honked when they passed a crowd of protesters in the north-western part of Minsk and slowed down to block traffic at a narrow street to prevent a police bus from reaching demonstrators, the witness told Reuters.
Tens of thousands of protesters take to the streets in Belarus weekly to demand Lukashenko quits.
""We shouldn't stop it, because if we stop, we will get back to 1937 and I don't want this to happen,"" said one of protesters Andrei, 32, referring to the worst year of mass repression under Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of protesting Indian farmers refused to comply with a government appeal to stop blockading major highways into New Delhi on Sunday and vowed to intensify their action against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's liberalising reforms.
Farmers from states around the capital have been demonstrating for three straight days against reforms that deregulate the sector and allow farmers to sell produce to buyers beyond government-regulated wholesale markets, where growers are assured of a minimum price.
Small growers fear the changes will make them vulnerable to competition from big business, and that they could eventually lose price supports for staples such as wheat and rice.
In a statement on Sunday, an umbrella group representing different farmers' unions slammed the government for saying it would engage in talks with the farmers if they moved their protest off the roads into a designated stadium site.
""The government, if serious about addressing the demands of farmers, should stop laying down any conditions and should come straight out with the solution it is offering,"" the statement said.
Modi sought to allay farmer concerns during his monthly radio address, saying ""farmers will get new rights and opportunities"" through these laws.
Union and opposition leaders, however, were unmoved by Modi's comments, and criticised the government's use of tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters on Friday. 
""Farmers are not fools who would not understand what is in their interest,"" said Yogendra Yadav, president of Swaraj India - an opposition party. 
With key roads blocked, prices of fresh produce at wholesale markets in Delhi have already begun to tick up, and the protests also disrupted commuter travel into the city.

The farmers' unions called on farmers in other states to expand the protests from Tuesday, while urging farmers in neighbouring states and others to join demonstrations in Delhi.

""Undoubtedly, Iran will give a calculated and decisive answer to the criminals who took Martyr Mohsen Fakhrizadeh from the Iranian nation,"" Kamal Kharrazi, who is also head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, said in a statement. 
Fakhrizadeh, long suspected by Western and Israeli government of masterminding a secret nuclear weapons program, was ambushed on a highway near Tehran on Friday and gunned down in his car.
Iran's clerical and military rulers have blamed the Islamic Republic's longtime enemy, Israel, for the killing. Iran has in the past accused Israel of killing several Iranian nuclear scientists since 2010.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has declined to comment on the killing. An Israeli cabinet minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, said on Saturday he did not know who carried it out.
Iranian hardline media called on Sunday for a tough revenge. 
The hardline Kayhan daily, whose editor-in-chief is appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for an attack on the Israeli port city of Haifa, if an Israeli role in Fakhrizadeh's killing is proven.
""The attack should be carried out in such a way that in addition to destroying the facilities, it should also cause heavy human casualties,"" wrote Saadollah Zarei in an opinion piece. 
However, Iran's rulers are aware of daunting military and political difficulties of attacking Israel. Such an attack would also complicate any effort by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to revive detente with Tehran after he takes office on Jan. 20.
Tensions have been high between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when President Donald Trump exited Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers and reimposed sanctions that have hit Iran's economy hard. In retaliation, Tehran has gradually breached the deal's curbs on its nuclear programme. 

Biden has said he will return the United States to the deal if Iran resumes compliance. Iran has always denied pursuing nuclear weapons.

GAZA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization delivered 15 ventilators to Gaza hospitals on Sunday amid a spike in COVID-19 infections that has tested the Palestinian territory's under-developed health system.
The donation of the intensive care devices, funded by Kuwait, came a week after local and international public health advisers said hospitals in the enclave could soon become overwhelmed.
""These devices will help medical teams provide better service to patients, but it is not enough,"" said Abdullatif Alhaj of Gaza's health ministry.
Alhaj said hospitals had suffered acute shortages in oxygen essential in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
Gaza has logged nearly 20,000 coronavirus cases and 97 deaths, mostly since August, amid concern of a wider outbreak in the densely populated enclave of 2 million people, many of whom live in poverty. 
The Gaza Health Ministry said 342 COVID-19 patients, of whom 108 are in critical condition, are being treated in the territory's hospitals, which have been able to expand their intensive care units to 150 beds over the past week.
It said more than half of the territory's 150 ventilators are in use.
""The health system right now can hold on for a few weeks after the expansion of beds,"" said Abdelnaser Soboh, emergency health lead in the World Health Organization's Gaza sub-office.
Soboh said Gaza is also experiencing severe shortages of medications and disposable equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients.
Palestinians in Hamas Islamist-run Gaza say 13 years of economic sanctions by Israel and its border blockade have crippled their economy and undermined the development of medical facilities, weakening their ability to tackle a pandemic.
Israel, which cites security concerns for the border restrictions it imposes along with neighbouring Egypt, says it has not limited the transfer of medical supplies to Gaza to fight the pandemic.

MADRID (Reuters) - Dancing and banging drums in the street, doctors and nurses protested in Madrid on Sunday against cuts which they say have left them struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Singing ""less flags and more nurses"", about 4,000 protesters marched through the Spanish capital, the region hit hardest by the coronavirus. 
""They are segregating (health). In the private health companies it is a business. In the public, everyone comes. If you don't have money, you don't get,"" said Lucia Tielvez, 65, an auxiliary health worker. 
Madrid's conservative regional government has denied cutting health services. 
Photographs published in Spanish media on Sunday showing cities packed with Christmas shoppers sparked fears of a spike in infections. 
""In Madrid we are very aware of COVID,"" tweeted Antonio R. Ajeno ironically, above a picture of crowds in Madrid. 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urged Spaniards to avoid large family gatherings this Christmas to avoid a rise in COVID-19 cases. 
""The next few months will be decisive. Experts predict that we will attend a critical stage of the pandemic, coinciding with the first mass vaccines,"" he told party supporters on Saturday.
Spain's left-wing government is considering limiting Christmas gatherings to six people. 
Spain added 10,853 new cases of COVID-19 to its tally on Friday, according to health ministry data, down from more than 12,000 new cases the day before.

The number of people who died from coronavirus in Spain rose by 294 on Friday, bringing the total death toll from the pandemic to 44,668, while the cumulative total of cases reached 1,628,208.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A team of animal experts began the task on Sunday of airlifting Pakistan's lonely elephant Kaavan on the long journey to his new home at a sanctuary in northwestern Cambodia, marking the culmination of years of campaigning by American singer Cher.
Cher, who has written songs calling for Kaavan to be rescued from his grim and lonely conditions at Islamabad Zoo, is due to meet the elephant upon its arrival in Cambodia after she spent the last few days with him in Islamabad.
On Sunday morning, dozens of wildlife workers and experts led by animal rescue organisation Four Paws used a winch and rope to pull the sedated elephant into a custom-designed crate in which he will be transported to the Cambodian city of Siem Reap.
""It is an emotional day for all of us,"" said Four Paws vet Amir Khalil. ""But we also call it 'D-day'."" 
Weighing more than 10 tons, the crate was then lifted by crane out of the enclosure and onto a truck. Later a military convoy will escort Kaavan to Islamabad's airport from where he will embark on a roughly 10-hour flight to Cambodia in the early hours of Monday morning on a former Russian cargo plane. 
Kaavan's handlers are taking more than 200 kilograms of food including bananas and melons for him to munch on during the journey, according to Four Paws.
Cher has been filming a documentary with the Smithsonian Channel covering the rescue, which is being facilitated by her animal welfare organisation Free the Wild. 

""I found out about Kaavan from the people on my Twitter,” said Cher, according to a statement from the Smithsonian Channel. ""I thought how can I fix this? How can I save an elephant who's been shackled to a shed for 17 years and who is a thousand miles away? This is Free The Wild’s first big rescue and I am so proud.""

Baz Mohammad Hemat, director of the provincial hospital in Ghazni, said 30 bodies and 24 injured people had been transported there. ""All of the victims are security personnel,"" he said.
The blast targeted a compound of the public protection force, a wing of the Afghan security forces, local officials said. It damaged civilian residences around the compound, and there could be more casualties from there, they said.
Interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian confirmed that there had been a car bomb blast but did not provide further information on the target or possible casualties.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, when contacted by Reuters, did not confirm or deny responsibility. 
Afghanistan has seen a spate of car bombings over the last few months, despite peace talks being under way between negotiation teams of the insurgent Taliban and the government in the Qatari capital of Doha.
Violence in the country, at war for two decades, remains unacceptably high, foreign governments and institutions say, calling for an immediate ceasefire between the Afghan government and Taliban.
Another bombing on Sunday, in the eastern province of Zabul, targeting a top provincial official, killed at least one person and injured 23, said Gul Islam Syaal, the spokesman for the province's governor.
Haji Ata Jan Haqbayan, head of the provincial council of Zabul, suffered minor injuries in the attack on his convoy.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on Haqbayan, an outspoken critic of the Taliban.

Nationalist Orban has long vilified Soros, a Hungarian Jew who emigrated after World War Two, as part of a general campaign against immigration. Orban accuses Brussels of trying to force Hungary to accept migrants under the influence of Soros.
In an op-ed published on Saturday, Szilard Demeter, who heads the Petofi Literary Museum and serves as a government cultural commissioner, called Soros ""the liberal Fuhrer"" and wrote that Europe was Soros' ""gas chamber"" with ""poisonous gas"" flowing from the capsule of multicultural open society.
Demeter issued a statement on Sunday that he would withdraw the article, saying his critics were right that ""the Nazi parallel could unintentionally hurt the memory of the victims.""
Earlier Hungarian Jewish groups including the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities called his op-ed ""unforgivable"" and ""an ugly provocation"".
The main leftist opposition party the Democratic Coalition called for Demeter's immediate dismissal. 
""The Democratic Coalition expects from the government that Szilard Demeter should be unemployed by the end of today. A man like him has no place in public life, not just in a European country but anywhere in the world,"" it said.
The government has not replied to emailed Reuters questions on whether they shared Demeter's views.
Referring to a budget row between Poland and Hungary and the European Union, Demeter said Poles and Hungarians were the ""new Jews"" who were targeted by liberals who tried to expel them from the bloc.
Poland and Hungary have said they would block a new European Union budget and coronavirus recovery fund if rule-of-law conditions are attached.
Israel's embassy tweeted that it utterly rejected ""the use and abuse of the memory of the Holocaust for any purpose... There is no place for connecting the worst crime in human history, or its perpetrators, to any contemporary debate, no matter how essential.""

Soros has been at odds with Orban's government for years for pouring funds into liberal organisations and institutions in Hungary. In 2019 the Central European University he founded said it was being forced out of the country by the nationalist government and moved most of its operations to Vienna.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>","Colombia must restart aerial fumigation to fight drug trafficking, defense minister says","By Luis Jaime Acosta
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia must restart aerial fumigation of coca with the herbicide glyphosate as soon as possible to reduce cocaine production, income for illegal armed groups, massacres and the killings of human rights activists, the defense minister said.
The Andean country, a top producer of cocaine, suspended aerial fumigation with glyphosate in 2015 on concerns by the World Health Organization (WHO) it may cause cancer. 
Cultivation of coca, the base ingredient in cocaine, subsequently shot up to its highest levels in nearly two decades in 2017, according to United Nations figures.
""There is no doubt at all. Colombia needs to reestablish aspersion, aerial fumigation with glyphosate for national security reasons,"" Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo told Reuters in an interview on Friday. ""Logically it needs to be reestablished with assurances for health and the environment.""
President Ivan Duque's government is in the process of complying with standards set by the Constitutional Court to resume the fumigation. 
It will also need environmental regulators' permission, recently delayed by legal actions from communities who oppose aerial fumigation.
The WHO's cancer arm classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagrees, saying the chemical is not a carcinogen.
Spraying with glyphosate will cut off resources ""for those who commit massacres and kill social leaders,"" Trujillo said, referring to the murders of human rights activists, many of whom oppose illegal mining and coca cultivation, and recent mass killings the government attributes to groups funded by drug trafficking.
There were 154,000 hectares (380,550 acres) planted with coca in Colombia at the close of 2019, according to the UN, with cocaine production potential at 1,137 metric tonnes. 
That figure is more than triple the 48,000 hectares recorded in 2013, when aerial fumigation was in use, Trujillo said.
Trujillo would not give an estimated date for a restart in spraying from airplanes, but said the practice is more efficient and safer than the manual eradication currently in use.
Between 400 and 600 hectares of coca could be destroyed daily with aerial fumigation, he said, compared with just 170 hectares with manual eradication.
Aerial fumigation also protects eradication teams from attacks by armed groups and landmines, Trujillo said. Sixteen members of the security forces have died so far in 2020 during eradication efforts and more than 100 have been injured.
The uptick in mass killings and murders of activists has sparked criticism from the international community and rights groups, which accuse Duque's government of not doing enough to protect vulnerable communities.
Research group Indepaz says 259 activists have been killed so far in 2020, while official statistics count 23 massacres with a total of 111 victims.
Despite the lack of aerial fumigation, Colombia will eradicate a record 130,000 hectares during 2020, the minister added.
Manual eradication and voluntary crop substitution will continue even once aerial fumigation is re-approved, Trujillo said.

""We need to create conditions for investment, large investment, investment in sustainable and profitable projects for Colombian farmers,"" Trujillo said.

ZABARMARI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Villagers in northeast Nigeria's Borno state on Sunday buried 43 farmers killed in an attack by suspected Islamist militants while security forces searched for dozens of people who are still missing. 
Roughly 30 of the men killed were also beheaded in the attack, which began on Saturday morning in Zabarmari village in northeast Borno state. Residents said a total of 70 people are feared dead.
While no group claimed responsibility, such massacres have been carried out in the past by Boko Haram or the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). They are both active in the region, where Islamic militants have killed at least 30,000 people in the past decade. 
President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the killings and said ""the entire country is hurt."" 
In Zabarmari, dozens of mourners surrounded the bodies, which were wrapped in white burial shrouds and placed on wooden pallets, as clerics led prayers for the deceased. 
One resident and Amnesty International said 10 women were among those missing. 
Borno state governor Babagana Zulum, speaking at the burials, called on the federal government to recruit more soldiers, Civilian Joint Task Force members and civil defence fighters to protect farmers in the region.
He described desperate choices facing people.
""In one side, they stay at home they may be killed by hunger and starvation, on the other, they go out to their farmlands and risk getting killed by the insurgents,"" he said.

Food prices in Nigeria have risen dramatically over the past year, driven by flooding, border closures and insecurity in some food-producing areas.

Beijing circumvented Hong Kong's legislature and imposed a national security law on the former British colony on June 30, a move condemned by some foreign governments, business groups and rights groups.
Hong Kong and authorities in Beijing said the law was necessary to restore stability after more than a year of anti-government protests.
""Sitting in front of you is a chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) who has no banking services made available to her,"" Lam told HKIBC, an English-language news channel in the city, on a preview clip shown late on Friday.
""I'm using cash for all the things,"" she said. ""I have piles of cash at home, the government is paying me cash for my salary because I don’t have a bank account.""
In August, the United States imposed sanctions on Lam and other top officials for what Washington says is their role in curtailing political freedoms in the territory.
""I don't want to... deter people from serving in a public position because it is very honourable in this set of circumstances to be so unjustifiably sanctioned by the U.S. government,"" Lam said.
Lam is paid about HK$5.21 million ($672,232) a year, according to local media reports, making her among the highest paid public officials in the world.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai anti-government protesters challenged on Sunday King Maha Vajiralongkorn's personal control over some army units to condemn the military's role in politics.
It was the latest open defiance of the king by protesters, who have broken taboos by criticising the monarchy in a country where it is officially revered under the constitution and laws ban insulting it.
Hundreds of protesters gathered to march to the 11th Infantry Regiment, one of two units that were moved under the king's command in 2019.
""An army should belong to the people, not the king,"" Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak told reporters. ""In a democratic system, the king is not responsible for directing command of the military.""
Protesters accuse the monarchy of enabling decades of military domination.
Parit is among several protest leaders who already face charges under lese majeste laws against insulting the monarchy after his speeches at previous rallies.
Protests which began in July initially demanded the departure of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and a new constitution, but now also seek to curb the powers of the king.
At the barracks, an advance guard of protesters set about removing razor wire barricades.
The foreign ministry said in a statement that the country adhered to the rule of law, but that the right to freedom of speech must keep within it.
""In every case where the law is violated, officials take action with strict adherence to the appropriate legal processes without discrimination,"" the ministry said.
Prayuth has rejected protesters' demands that he quit along with their accusations that he engineered last year's election to keep power that he first took from an elected government in 2014.

The Royal Palace has made no comment since the protests began, but the king has said that despite their actions the protesters are loved ""all the same"".

Austria's nationwide lockdown is due to be lifted on Dec. 7, but it is not yet clear what that will mean for the ski industry - cornerstone of a tourism sector which accounts for some 15% of economic output - or overall life in Austria. 
Speaking to Kleine Zeitung, Kurz said Austrians would need to contend with further restrictions for weeks and months, adding new measures to be announced on Wednesday depended on COVID-19 case developments.
""The higher the infection numbers, the harder it will be to introduce steps for reopening,"" Kurz said in the interview published on Sunday. ""We will have to live with further massive restrictions after December 7.""
The government aims to begin reopening with trade and schools, he said, while establishing cautious steps towards easing.
Asked about the potential for a ski season, Kurz told the paper sports and leisure facilities would not be part of the first easing measures, but the government intended to enable more outdoor and individual sports in the foreseeable future.
""Separate from that is the question of tourism,"" he said. 
""What's already clear, apres-ski will happen at the earliest in one year,"" he said, referring to the tradition of a post-ski drink in mountain bars and restaurants.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Hundreds of handcuffed Salvadoran gang members were displayed before assembled reporters on Saturday, a vivid show of President Nayib Bukele's policy of confronting them and the violent crime they are accused of committing.
Some 600 members of El Salvador's Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang and its rival Barrio 18 made up the bulk of the detentions that were announced on Friday, following a one-week U.S.-backed round-up of Central American gangs that also netted arrests in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras.
The detainees paraded before the press on Saturday, a common tactic that predates Bukele, have been charged with murder, kidnapping and human trafficking, among other crimes, according to officials.
In April, Bukele provoked the ire of rights groups when he published on social media jarring pictures of hundreds of semi-naked jailed gang members, pressed tightly together in rows, despite the raging pandemic.
At the time, the inmates were being punished for an outbreak of violence.
Security Minister Rogelio Rivas called the majority of the newly-detained ""terrorists"" in remarks after they were assembled in an open-air plaza by heavily-armed soldiers, nearly all the detainees wearing masks and with their faces, many tattooed, looking down.
Government figures show that the murder rate has fallen by nearly half so far this year compared to the same period last year, which Bukele argues is due to a larger military and police presence on streets as well as in jails believed to be controlled by the gangs.
In September, online news site El Faro published an investigation revealing an alleged negotiation between the government and MS-13 over reducing homicides in exchange for other benefits, including electoral support for Bukele, an accusation the president has denied.
The latest round-up could be meant to refute the idea that the government is negotiating with the gangs, security analyst Jeannette Aguilar said in an interview.

The 94-year-old, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, is due to mark her Platinum Jubilee in February 2022.
The government is planning a four-day celebration that summer, featuring an extra day's public holiday, with tree planting to be a feature of the milestone, according to an announcement on Sunday.
Named ""The Queen's Green Canopy,"" the charity-backed project will encourage communities, schools, councils and landowners to plant native trees to help the environment and make local areas greener. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the health crisis and pandemic had reminded people of the importance of nature and green spaces and that trees could transform communities as well as tackling climate change. 
""As we celebrate Her Majesty’s incredible 70 years of service, I encourage everyone to get behind this scheme and go ‘Plant a Tree for the Jubilee,'"" Johnson said. 
Charities Cool Earth and The Woodland Trust said the planting of trees would create a special gift for the monarch, who has planted more than 1,500 trees around the world during her reign.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2020 06:05PM ET</span>","Ethiopian military operation in Tigray is complete, prime minister says","ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Saturday that military operations in the restive region of Tigray are complete and federal troops control the regional capital, a major development in a three-week-old war that has shaken the Horn of Africa. 
Abiy's government has been trying to quell a rebellion by a powerful ethnic faction that dominated the central government for decades before he came to power in 2018. Thousands of people are believed to have been killed, and nearly 44,000 have fled to Sudan, in a conflict that has called into question whether Abiy can hold together fractious ethnic groups in Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country.
""I am pleased to share that we have completed and ceased the military operations in the Tigray region,"" the prime minister said in a tweet. Less than an hour earlier, he said in a statement, ""The federal government is now fully in control of the city of Mekelle"".
However the leader of Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), whose forces have been fighting Ethiopian troops, said the group was not giving up.
""Their brutality can only add (to) our resolve to fight these invaders to the last,"" TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters in a text message. Asked by Reuters if that meant his forces would continue fighting, he replied: “Certainly. This is about defending our right to self determination.”
There was no immediate response from the government.
In his statement, Abiy said federal police would continue searching for and detaining TPLF ""criminals"" and would bring them to court. The prime minister has called the offensive a law and order operation.
It was not clear if any TPLF leaders had surrendered. Debretsion said in another text message that their forces were withdrawing from around Mekelle.
Claims from all sides are difficult to verify since phone and internet links to Tigray have been down and access tightly controlled since the fighting began on Nov. 4.
Authorities had said earlier on Saturday that government forces were in the final stages of an offensive in the region and would take care to protect civilians in Mekelle, a city of 500,000 people.
Abiy said the army had secured the release of thousands of troops from the army's Northern Command, which is based in Tigray, who he said had been held hostage by the TPLF.
Federal troops had also taken control of the airport, the regional administration office and other key facilities, Abiy said. 
The government had given the TPLF an ultimatum that expired on Wednesday to lay down arms or face an assault on the city.
It was not clear if federal forces had seized weapons stocks on Saturday. The government said in the first week of the conflict that a target of its airstrikes was military hardware seized by Tigrayan forces. 
Regional diplomats and experts have said that a rapid military victory might not signal the end of the conflict. 
Two diplomats told Reuters it was likely that Tigrayan forces had withdrawn from Mekelle before the government's push into the city, raising the prospect of a protracted guerrilla war.
The TPLF has a history of guerrilla resistance and used Tigray's highland terrain and foreign borders to its advantage through years of armed struggle in the 1980s against a Marxist government.
The prime minister has so far rebuffed attempts at mediation. Abiy accuses Tigrayan leaders of starting the war by attacking federal troops at a base in Tigray. The TPLF says the attack was a pre-emptive strike.
NO WORD ON CASUALTIES
Abiy did not mention in his statements whether there had been casualties in the offensive to capture Mekelle.
Rights groups have been concerned that an assault on the city could lead to significant civilian casualties.
The prime minister's spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, had said earlier on Saturday: ""The safety of Ethiopians in Mekelle and Tigray region continues as priority for the federal government"". 
TPLF leader Debretsion told Reuters in text messages earlier on Saturday that Mekelle was under ""heavy bombardment"".
Billene said: ""The Ethiopian National Defense Forces do not have a mission to bombard its own city and people. Mekelle remains one of Ethiopia's key cities and the efforts to bring to justice the criminal clique will not entail discriminatory 'bombardment' as alluded by TPLF and their propagandists.""
Debretsion also accused the military from the neighbouring country of Eritrea of crossing the border and raiding refugee camps in Tigray to capture refugees who have fled Eritrea in the past. 
The Eritrean government has not responded to calls from Reuters for more than two weeks. 
United Nations refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi said on Saturday that he was deeply concerned about the 100,000 Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia, and what he called unconfirmed reports of violence against them. 
The TPLF and Eritrea are archenemies: the TPLF was in charge in Addis Ababa when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a war from 1998-2000. But Eritrea and Abiy have warm relations. The Ethiopian government has denied TPLF accusations that Eritrean troops are operating on Ethiopian soil. 
Eritrea is one of the world's most repressive nations and around 10% of the population has fled. 
Tigrayans, who make up about 6% of the Ethiopian population of 115 million, dominated the government until Abiy took power two years ago. He pledged to unite Ethiopians and introduce freedoms after years of state repression that filled jails with tens of thousands of political prisoners. 

His government also put senior Tigrayan officials on trial for crimes such as corruption, torture and murder. The Tigrayan region saw those trials as discrimination.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Among the new cardinals formally installed by Pope Francis on Saturday is an outspoken Mexican cleric who has spent decades ministering to the mostly poor, indigenous communities near the country's southern border with Guatemala.
Felipe Arizmendi, known for progressive views on indigenous rights and migrants as well as a staunchly conservative stance on sexuality, was presented with the ring and scarlet red biretta of the so-called princes of the Catholic church at a scaled-down ceremony at the Vatican due to pandemic precautions.
One of 13 prelates to receive the honorific on Saturday, Arizmendi has served as a bishop in the southern state of Chiapas since the early 1990s, just before the launch of the indigenous uprising led by the Zapatista National Liberation Army, which had issued a declaration of war against the government citing a long history of oppression.
In the years since, Arizmendi has lauded the Zapatista movement's demands for justice, in addition to his embrace of Central American migrants who have for years traveled through southern Mexico on their way to the United States.
The 80-year-old Arizmendi, author of more than 30 books and a regular newspaper columnist, is just past the cut-off age to be able to vote in future papal conclaves, where new popes are elected.
Over the past decade, he has also railed against what he described as the spread of ""homosexualism"" from cities to rural areas. While earlier this year he bemoaned ""too much debauchery"" in a column otherwise dedicated to arguing that it is wrong to see the coronavirus pandemic as divine punishment.
Several of the new set of cardinals announced last month but installed on Saturday come from the developing world, including Rwanda and Brunei, as Pope Francis continues to remake a more inclusive Church leadership with more prelates from outside Europe.

(This story corrects last paragraph to note that several, but not most, of new cardinals come from developing world)

Following the announcement, Serbia declared persona non grata the Montenegrin ambassador to Serbia and gave him 72 hours to leave the country.
In the statement, Montenegro's ministry said that despite written and verbal warning not to interfere into internal affairs, the Serbian ambassador said that the 1918 session of the parliament in which Montenegro's sovereignty was abolished was ""liberating.""
The tiny Adriatic state of 600,000 was a kingdom until 1918 when it abolished its sovereignty to join Yugoslavia. It stayed in a union with Serbia after Yugoslavia fell apart in the early 1990's, and declared independence in 2006. 
The outgoing government that expelled Vladimir Bozovic will be succeeded by a new pro-Serb cabinet of the parties that won elections in August. 
The pro-Western Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) led by President Milo Djukanovic, which steered Montenegro through the violent collapse of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, lost the parliamentary election last week.
It will not be able to form a government for the first time since 1990, when a multi-party system was introduced.

The police said the arrests had been made for different offences including assaulting a police officer, possession of drugs and breaching coronavirus restrictions. England's current lockdown ends on Dec. 2. 
Earlier police lined up in a number of streets in central London's West End shopping district and confronted crowds of protesters in St James's Park, near Westminster. The anti-lockdown protesters were joined by groups who oppose a COVID-19 vaccine. 
One police officer estimated the protesters, who held up signs saying ""Defend Freedom, Defend Humanity"", ""No more lies, no more masks, no more lockdowns"", numbered between 300 and 400. 
London's Metropolitan Police said they had intercepted and turned back coaches full of people wanting to join the demonstrations.

PARIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of black-clad protesters clashed with police at the end of a demonstration against police violence in Paris on Saturday after masked protesters launched fireworks at police lines, put up barricades and threw stones. 
The majority of the thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully, but small groups of masked protesters dressed in black smashed shop windows and set two cars, a motorcycle and a cafe on fire. The fires were put out quickly.
Police fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the crowds and in early evening water cannon sprayed remaining groups of protesters on Place de la Bastille. 
The interior ministry said it had counted 46,000 protesters in Paris. Police said they had made nine arrests.
Thousands of people also marched in Lille, Rennes, Strasbourg and other cities.
The protests follow the publication this week of CCTV footage of the minutes-long beating of Black music producer Michel Zecler by three police officers in Paris on Nov. 21. 
The incident has also fanned anger about a draft law that is seen as curbing the right of journalists to report on police brutality.
The bill would make it a crime to circulate images of police officers in certain circumstances, which opponents say would limit press freedom. 
Many protesters carried placards with slogans like ""Who will protect us from the police"", ""Stop police violence"" and ""Democracy bludgeoned"".
The images of Zecler being beaten have circulated widely on social media and in the French and foreign press. President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday the images were shameful for France.
Four police officers are being held for questioning as part of an investigation into the beating. 
""What is happening in Paris is extremely worrying and we cannot let this pass. I have spent two years with the yellow vests and I have seen all the violence,"" demonstrator Caroline Schatz told Reuters at the Paris march. 

The journalists' organisations and civil liberty groups who organised the marches were joined by far-left militants, environmental activists and yellow vest protesters. The yellow vests have been protesting against government policies for two years.

HAVANA (Reuters) - A rare public protest in Cuba of more than 300 artists, activists and members of the public outside the culture ministry to denounce repression and censorship ended early on Saturday after demonstrators said they agreed with officials to open an unprecedented dialogue.
Thirty of the protesters including performance artist Tania Bruguera and film director Fernando Perez met for more than four hours with Deputy Minister Fernando Rojas and said they had agreed to start a series of meetings to resolves differences. 
The group said Rojas also agreed to review the cases of a rapper sentenced this month to eight months in jail on charges of contempt and a dissident artist detained since Thursday.
Cuba's Communist government had previously dismissed both as mercenaries directed by its arch enemy the United States, as it generally does with dissidents.
Not all of the protesters outside the ministry were convinced by the non-binding reassurances, and were disappointed no officials came out to give a briefing on the meeting.
But most said it was already an historic achievement to have forced the government to talk with those who think differently and for some, broken the fear of speaking out in public in the one party state.
""It's a special flame that ignited here today,"" said activist and music promoter Michel Matos, who took part in the meeting with Rojas.
""We talked about freedom of expression, freedom of association, censorship and physical repression,"" Matos said. ""I don't think there has been a dialogue like this in a ministerial space in 60 years.""
The government made no statement and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting. 
The protesters included citizens who usually shy away from talking publicly about politics but felt emboldened to join after seeing images of the crowd on social media, underscoring how internet expansion in Cuba is making it harder for the government to contain dissent. 
As their representatives met with officials inside, protesters outside the ministry sang and clapped every 10 minutes to show their solidarity.
""Without the pressure that you exerted outside, without your applause while we talked, without your shouts we would not have been able to arrive at these agreements,"" Bruguera said.
Trucks carrying police and security forces surrounded the area. Other than at one point firing tear gas to try to prevent some protesters from reaching the ministry, they did not intervene. 
The protest was sparked by authorities' crackdown on the San Isidro Movement of dissident artists and activists to which Matos belongs that formed two years ago to protest curbs on freedom of expression, often through irreverent performances.
The situation came to a head after authorities besieged the movement's headquarters in Old Havana's San Isidro district then on Thursday broke up a hunger strike there that had started to gain international attention. 
Security forces forcibly removed and briefly detained the five members on hunger strike and nine other people in the house, citing violations of coronavirus protocols. 
Those detained said their phones were seized so they could not transmit any footage of the raid.

Some Cubans reported that social media platforms in the country, where the state has a monopoly on telecommunications, were briefly shut down to prevent news of the raid from being shared online.

UK interior minister Priti Patel said that under the deal, the number of officers patrolling French beaches would double, and new equipment including drones and radar would be employed. 
This year, hundreds of people, including some children, have been caught crossing to southern England from makeshift camps in northern France - navigating one of the world's busiest shipping routes in overloaded rubber dinghies. Some migrants have drowned. 
Patel said in statement that the agreement represented a step forward in the pair's mission to make channel crossings unviable. 
""Thanks to more police patrols on French beaches and enhanced intelligence sharing between our security and law enforcement agencies, we are already seeing fewer migrants leaving French beaches,"" she said. 
The UK and France plan to continue a close dialogue to reduce migratory pressures at the shared border over the next year, she added. 
Patel told UK media that French authorities had stopped 5,000 migrants from travelling to the UK so far this year. She said over the last ten years, the UK had given France 150 million pounds to tackle immigration. 
She said the recent focus by authorities on stopping small boats meant they were now seeing more migrants trying to cross the Channel via lorries, and that border security was being tightened in France to try to stop that. 

Britain is also planning to introduce a new asylum system through legislation next year, Patel said.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Iran's leader promises retaliation for nuclear scientist's killing,"By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's supreme leader promised on Saturday to retaliate for the killing of the Islamic Republic's top nuclear scientist, raising the threat of a new confrontation with the West and Israel in the remaining weeks of Donald Trump's presidency.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pledged to continue the work of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who Western and Israeli governments believe was the architect of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme.
Friday's killing, which Iran's president was swift to blame on Israel, could complicate any efforts by President-elect Joe Biden to revive a detente with Tehran that was forged when he was in Barack Obama's administration.
Trump pulled Washington out of the 2015 international nuclear pact agreed between Tehran and major powers. 
Khamenei, who is Iran's top authority and who says the country has never sought nuclear arms, said on Twitter that Iranian officials must take up the task of ""pursuing this crime and punishing its perpetrators and those who commanded it"".
Fakhrizadeh, who had little public profile in Iran but who Israel named as a prime player in what it says is Iran's nuclear weapons quest, was killed on Friday when he was ambushed near Tehran and his car sprayed with bullets. He was rushed to hospital where he died.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told a televised meeting on Saturday Iran would respond ""at the proper time"".
""Once again, the evil hands of Global Arrogance and the Zionist mercenaries were stained with the blood of an Iranian son,"" he said, using terms officials employ to refer to Israel.
Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi, a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said he did not know who carried out the killing. ""I have no clue who did it. It's not that my lips are sealed because I'm being responsible, I simply really have no clue,"" he told N12's Meet the Press.
CHALLENGE FOR BIDEN
Israel's Army Radio said some Israeli embassies had been put on high alert after the Iranian threats of retaliation, though there were no reports of concrete threats. The radio's military affairs correspondent said the army was on routine footing.
Netanyahu's office has declined to comment on the killing of Fakhrizadeh and an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said the ministry did not comment on security regarding missions abroad.
The White House, Pentagon, U.S. State Department and CIA have also declined to comment on the killing, as has Biden's transition team. Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
""Whether Iran is tempted to take revenge or whether it restrains itself, it will make it difficult for Biden to return to the nuclear agreement,"" Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli military intelligence chief and director of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, wrote on Twitter.
Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions. Once Trump withdrew in 2018, U.S. sanctions were ramped up, driving down Iran's vital oil exports and crippling the economy. Tehran, meanwhile, sped up its nuclear work.
Germany, a party to the nuclear pact, and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for restraint from all sides.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that it was ""shameful that some refuse to stand against terrorism and hide behind calls for restraint"".
ACCELERATING NUCLEAR WORK
A senior official told Reuters: ""Definitely Iran will retaliate. When and how depends on our national interests. It might happen in the coming days or weeks, but it will happen.""
He pointed to Iran's retaliatory missile attacks in January on an Iraqi base where U.S. forces were stationed, days after a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. No U.S. troops were killed in the action.
""The martyrdom of Fakhrizadeh will accelerate our nuclear work,"" said Fereydoon Abbasi, the former head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, who survived an assassination attempt in 2010.
At least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what Tehran said was a programme of assassinations aimed at sabotaging its nuclear energy programme. Iran has always denied pursuing nuclear weapons, saying its aims are only peaceful.
Fakhrizadeh was thought to have headed what the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.S. intelligence services believe was Iran's nuclear arms programme.
He was the only Iranian scientist named in the IAEA's 2015 ""final assessment"" of open questions about Iran's nuclear programme. It said he oversaw activities ""in support of a possible military dimension to (Iran's) nuclear programme"".
Fakhrizadeh was also a central figure in a presentation by the Israeli prime minister in 2018 accusing Iran of continuing to seek nuclear weapons. ""Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh,"" Netanyahu said at the time. 
U.S. intelligence services and the IAEA believe Iran halted its coordinated weapons programme in 2003. The IAEA has said it had no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009.

The United States deployed U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz with accompanying ships to the Gulf on Wednesday, shortly before the killing, but a U.S. Navy spokeswoman said the deployment was not related to any specific threats.

149,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2020 12:21PM ET</span>","Pope installs new cardinals, including first African-American","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Saturday installed 13 new cardinals, including the first African-American to hold the high rank, further expanding the pontiff's impact on the group that will one day elect his successor. 
The cardinals were installed in a ceremony, known as a consistory, that was markedly slimmed down because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Instead of the usual thousands, only 10 guests per cardinal were allowed in St. Peter's Basilica as the pope gave the men their ring and traditional red hat, known as a biretta.
Nine of the 13 are under 80 and eligible under Church law to enter a secret conclave to choose the next pope from among themselves after Francis dies or resigns.
It was Francis' seventh consistory since his election in 2013. He has now appointed 57% of the 128 cardinal electors, most of whom share his vision of a more inclusive and outward-looking Church.
Thus far, he has appointed 18 cardinals from mostly far-flung countries that never had one, nearly all of them from the developing world. In Saturday's consistory, Brunei and Rwanda got their first cardinals.
While Europe still has the largest share of cardinal electors, with 41%, it is down from 52% in 2013 when Francis became the first Latin-American pope.
With each consistory, Francis has increased the chances that his successor will be another non-European, having beefed up the Church in places where it is either a tiny minority or where it is growing faster than in the stagnant West.
The nine new electors come from Italy, Malta, Rwanda, the United States, the Philippines, Chile, Brunei and Mexico.
In his homily, Francis told the men to keep their eyes on God, avoid all forms of corruption, and not succumb to a ""worldly spirit"" that can accompany the prestige and power of their new rank.
Wilton Gregory, the 72-year-old archbishop of Washington, D.C, becomes the first African-American cardinal at a time the United States is examining race relations after a spate of police killings of unarmed Black people.
Everyone in the basilica except the pope wore a mask. Each new cardinal removed theirs when they knelt before him to be invested, except Gregory, who kept it on. 
Gregory made headlines in June when he blasted President Donald Trump's visit to a Catholic shrine in Washington, after police and soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear protesters so Trump could be photographed in front of a historic Washington church holding a Bible.
Gregory said he found it ""baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated"".
Catholic conservatives condemned Gregory and sided with Trump.
In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Gregory said he wanted to find common ground with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden despite disagreements on issues such as abortion.
Gregory was one of a handful of new cardinals who were quarantined for about 10 days in their rooms in the Vatican guest house where the pope also lives. Cardinals from Brunei and the Philippines could not travel and will receive their ring and hat from a papal delegate.
Four non-electors over 80 were given the honour after a long service to the Church. The most prominent is Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, an Italian-American who has worked around the world and is one of the Church's top experts on immigration.

The new cardinals later paid a courtesy visit to 93-year-old former Pope Benedict XVI, who lives on the Vatican grounds.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government on Saturday invited leaders of protesting farmers' unions for talks next week to address concerns about new laws which seek to deregulate the country's large agriculture sector.
Farmers arrived in trucks, buses and tractors on Saturday at Delhi's Singhu border with Haryana state and blocked the main northern highway into the capital. They chanted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and waved the red, yellow and green flags of farmer's unions.
The government has deployed hundreds of police and paramilitary forces in response.
""I appeal to the protesting farmers that the government of India is ready to hold talks regarding your problems. Representatives of farmers have been invited on Dec. 3 for a discussion,"" Home Minister Amit Shah said in a statement on Saturday.
The offer came a day after clashes ended with an agreement that the farmers could demonstrate in the capital, amid protests over laws that farmers fear could rob them of minimum guaranteed prices for their produce.
Shah appealed to the farmers, who appeared ready for a long sit-in, to hold their protest at an allocated site in north Delhi, where toilet facilities, drinking water and ambulances have been arranged.
He said farmers' unions wanted to hold discussions before Dec. 3. ""I want to assure you all that as soon as you shift your protest to structured place, the government will hold talks to address your concerns the very next day"".
On Friday, police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse the protesters before letting them march into the capital. [L1N2ID09V]
Both security forces and farmers have installed barricades to prevent a repeat of Friday's clashes.
Harbhajan Singh, 75, from Amritsar in the major northern farming state of Punjab, said he and others were carrying provisions and were prepared to camp out. 
""We have been harassed by the government. We want a special parliament session for withdrawal of the new farm laws,"" Singh said, adding he hopes farmers from other states will join the protests to pressure the government.
Opposition Congress Party leader Rahul Gandhi also slammed the government.
""Our slogan was, 'Hail the Soldier, Hail the Farmer,' but today PM Modi's arrogance made the soldier stand against the farmer. This is very dangerous,"" Gandhi tweeted in reaction to a photo of a policeman attempting to hit a farmer with a baton.
Modi's laws, enacted in September, let farmers sell their produce anywhere, including to big corporate buyers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, not just at government-regulated wholesale markets where growers are assured of a minimum procurement price.

But many small growers worry they will be left vulnerable to big business and could eventually lose the price supports for key staples such as wheat and rice.

Speaking to the news channel Metro TV, Awi did not explain the alleged attackers' motivation. He did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, has grappled with intermittent militant attacks recently.
""This attack is another serious escalation against the Christian minority in Indonesia,"" Human Rights Watch researcher Andreas Harsono told Reuters.
Gomar Gultom, the head of the Communion of Churches in Indonesia, told Reuters the victims were Christian and urged the authorities to resolve the case.
International Christian Concern, a Washington-based advocacy group, posted on its website on Friday that ""an alleged terrorist"" killed four Christians in the Sulawesi village, burning down a Salvation Army post and Christian homes.
Awi said, ""We're on the ground now, there's about 100 people who will start chasing.""
The investigation, led by the Indonesian police and the military, may run into hurdles as the incident took place in a hilly, remote village near the region of Sigi in Central Sulawesi province, he said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - In the Rotundo household in Buenos Aires, the spirit of Diego Maradona has a living tribute: twin nine-year-old girls, Mara and Dona, named after the soccer legend who died this week.
The diminutive playmaker, one of the world's best ever who led Argentina to World Cup glory, inspired avid support through his magic on the pitch and his charisma off it, despite a turbulent personal life dogged by addiction.
Maradona died of heart failure on Wednesday and was laid to rest on Thursday amid huge fanfare and high emotion, with thousands of people crowding the streets around the capital as his body was taken to be buried.
The naming of the twins was never in doubt, said their dad, Walter Rotundo, who has a tattoo of Maradona on his back and proudly shows a photograph of the soccer star holding a picture of the two girls as infants.
Walter said the decision over the names went back to the 1990 World Cup when he saw Maradona cry inconsolably after losing the final 1-0 to West Germany. He told his wife, Stella Maris Prez, the first time they met that they would one day have two daughters - named after the star.
Maradona has almost cult status in Argentina, where his nickname ""D10S"" is a play of the Spanish word for ""God"" and his famed number 10 shirt. Mara and Dona have their own Argentina shirts with the number and their names.
Mara, older than her sister by a minute, said she loved her name and the story behind it.
""It seems very beautiful to me to have this name and what I like the most about this name is knowing why he called me that. I feel that this name is wonderful,"" she said.
Dona said Maradona's death had come as a shock.

""I can't believe that he died or why he died,"" she said. ""He is a very good person, he did not deserve that.""

""The U.S. Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners in Central America are committed to continued collaboration in locating and arresting gang members and associates engaged in transnational crimes,"" said U.S. Attorney General William Barr, according to the statement.
The charges resulted from a one-week coordinated law enforcement action under Operation Regional Shield (ORS), a DOJ-led initiative to combat transnational organized crime that brings together authorities from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and the United States.
Tackling transnational human smuggling networks and gangs, including MS-13, is a top priority for U.S. President Donald Trump.
Prosecutors in El Salvador this week filed criminal charges against 1,152 members of organized crime groups in the country, primarily MS-13 and 18th Street gangs, the statement said.
The national civil police captured 572 of the defendants on charges involving terrorism, murder, extortion, kidnapping, money laundering, human trafficking and human smuggling, among others.
In Guatemala, authorities executed 80 search warrants, arrested 40 individuals and served 29 arrest warrants against people already in custody, all of whom are members of the 18th Street gang and MS-13, the DOJ said.
Guatemalan authorities seized drugs and a firearm, and filed charges for extortion, illicit association, conspiracy to commit murder and extortive obstruction.

In Honduras, the one-week joint operation resulted in the arrest of over 75 MS-13 and 18th Street gang members and five police officers and the execution of over 10 search warrants.

(Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
Certain blood groups less likely to get COVID-19
A large study adds to evidence that people with type O or Rh−negative blood may be at slightly lower risk from the new coronavirus. Among 225,556 Canadians who were tested for the virus, the risk for a COVID-19 diagnosis was 12% lower and the risk for severe COVID-19 or death was 13% lower in people with blood group O versus those with A, AB, or B, researchers reported on Tuesday in Annals of Internal Medicine. People in any blood group who were Rh-negative were also somewhat protected, especially if they had O-negative blood. People in these blood type groups may have developed antibodies that can recognize some aspect of the new virus, coauthor Dr. Joel Ray of St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto told Reuters. ""Our next study will specifically look at such antibodies, and whether they explain the protective effect,"" Ray said. Whether or how this information might influence COVID-19 prevention or treatment is still unclear. (https:// Vitamin D fails to help in severe COVID-19 cases Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to higher risk for severe COVID-19, but high vitamin D levels do not fix the problem. Increasing vitamin D levels in critically ill patients did not shorten their hospital stay or lower their odds of being moved to intensive care, needing mechanical ventilation, or dying, doctors in Brazil found. They randomly gave 240 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 either a single high dose of vitamin D3 or a placebo. Only 6.7% of patients in the vitamin D group had ""deficient"" levels of the nutrient, compared to 51.5% of patients in the placebo group, but there was no difference in the outcomes, according to a paper posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The same was true when the researchers focused on the 116 patients with vitamin D deficiency before the treatment. The authors say theirs is the first randomized trial of its kind to show that vitamin D supplementation ""is ineffective to improve hospital length of stay or any other clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19."" (https:// Triggers of COVID-19 ""cytokine storm"" identified A form of inflammatory cell death called panoptosis triggers the storm of cytokines, or inflammatory proteins, that causes critical illness in COVID-19, researchers say. During panoptosis, ""cells spew out their contents instead of neatly packaging them away"" as happens during routine cell death, Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital told Reuters. Neighboring cells see the debris, including cytokines, as a sign of danger, and respond by secreting more cytokines, allowing the cytokine storm to build, said Kanneganti. Her team identified a synergy between two cytokines, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, as the cause of panoptosis in COVID-19. Mice given TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma developed the symptoms and organ damage of COVID-19 and died rapidly, Kanneganti said. Treatment with antibodies that neutralize these two cytokines protected the mice from death, not just from COVID-19 but also from other life-threatening illnesses involving cytokine storms, such as sepsis, her team reported in Cell.

Many of the 26 soldiers belong to a logistics unit in Neustadt am Ruebenberge in northern Germany, the ministry said in a report to parliament dated Friday and first reported by public ARD television. 
Civilian and military prosecutors started investigations immediately after the accusations became known in October, it added. So far, three of the soldiers have been banned from wearing a uniform and working for the military, the document said, without elaborating.
The case is the latest in a series of far-right scandals to surface in the German military.
In June, Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer disbanded a company of the army's elite KSK special forces after recurring incidents involving far-right extremism.
""The deeper you dig into the forces, the more right-wing activities you find,"" Alexander Neu, a lawmaker with the opposition far-left Linke, told Reuters.
""This shows that the fondly nourished hypothesis that we are talking of isolated cases is just a fairy tale.""

At least 20 others were wounded in the bombing and shooting assault on the Jo Goldenberg restaurant in the Marais quarter in August 1982.
In 2015, arrest warrants were issued against three former members of the Abu Nidal Organization, a splinter group of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), a source told Reuters at the time.
The suspects were identified long after the attacks because of statements from other former members of the Abu Nidal group under a French judicial process that maintained their anonymity, the source said.
One of the men, named as Walid Abdulrahman Abu Zayed, lives in Norway, where he moved in the 1990s. Norwegian authorities rejected an original 2015 extradition request for him on grounds that, in most cases, it would not extradite its own citizens.
Norway recently adopted new pan-European regulations on arrests, leading French prosecutors to seek extradition of the suspect for a second time, and he was arrested in September.
The Ministry of Justice cleared Abu Zayed for extradition to France on Nov. 12 but the decision was later appealed to the full Norwegian cabinet.
""The appeal was unsuccessful and today the decision was final,"" a spokeswoman for the justice ministry said in an email to Reuters.
Now in his early 60s, Abu Zayed has denied any involvement in the case. In 2015, he told the Norwegian daily VG he had never been to Paris.

The Jo Goldenberg bloodshed, at the time, marked the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in France since World War Two and came amid a wave of violence involving Palestinian militants.

Followers of Sadr carrying pictures of the cleric marched to the central al-Haboubi square, where anti-government protesters have held a sit-in since 2019, after Friday prayers. 
They fired gunshots and threw petrol bombs at the protesters' tents, leading the protesters to fight back, the Reuters witness said.
A hospital source said the protesters died from bullet wounds. The clashes were still going on on Friday evening.
Haboubi square, where one of the worst killings of demonstrators took place last year and the last major protest site, had been cleared on Friday night by Sadr supporters, Reuters witness said, another major blow to anti-government protests that have largely lost steam in recent months.
""Another massacre took place today... against the peaceful protesters using live ammunition. We ask the Sadrist movement and Sayyed Moqtada (al-Sadr) to stop this strife and stop their assaults against peaceful protesters,"" anti-government protester Mohannad al-Mansour said.
Last month Iraqi security forces cleared out sit-in tents in Baghdad's Tahrir square, which became a symbol of anti-government protests during months-long mass unrest last year.
Iraq’s biggest anti-government protests in decades broke out in October 2019 and continued for several months, with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis demanding jobs, services and the removal of the ruling elite, which they said was corrupt. Nearly 500 people were killed. The protests caused the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who took office in May, has pledged to hold a parliamentary election, in line with a demand of many pro-democracy activists.
Earlier on Friday, thousands of Sadrists gathered in Tahrir Square in Baghdad and in other southern provinces to show support for the influential cleric ahead of the election scheduled for June next year.
Sadr, who leads the largest bloc in Iraq's parliament, said he expects his movement to win a majority of seats.
Sadr, a long-time adversary of the United States, also opposes Iranian influence in Iraq.

Federal forces have captured Wikro ""and will control Mekelle in a few days"", Lieutenant-General Hassan Ibrahim said in a statement. Government troops had also taken control of several other towns, he added.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for comment, or to verify the statement.
Claims by all sides in the three-week-old conflict between government and TPLF forces have been impossible to verify because phone and internet connections to the region are down and access to the area is tightly controlled.
On Sunday, the government gave the TPLF until Wednesday to lay down arms or face an assault on Mekelle, a city of 500,000 people, raising fears among aid groups of extensive civilian casualties.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed accuses Tigrayan leaders of starting the war by attacking federal troops at a base in Tigray on Nov. 4. The TPLF says the attack was a pre-emptive strike. 
Abiy, who announced on Thursday that the military was beginning the ""final phase"" of its offensive, told African peace envoys earlier on Friday that his government will protect civilians in Tigray. 
But a statement issued by the prime minister's office after their meeting made no mention of talks with the TPLF to end fighting.
The statement issued after Abiy met the African Union envoys - former presidents Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and Kgalema Motlanthe of South Africa - said the government was committed to the ""protection and security of civilians"".
The statement thanked the envoys for imparting their ""wisdom, insights, and readiness to support in any way they are needed"" and did not mention any plans for further discussions with them.
The envoys had been sent to Addis Ababa to help mediate in the conflict, something that Abiy had already made clear he did not want.
The prime minister, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade standoff with Eritrea, has said he will not talk to TPLF leaders until they are defeated or give up.
Thousands of people are already believed to have been killed following air strikes and ground fighting. The United Nations estimates 1.1 million Ethiopians will need aid as a result of the conflict.
The bloodshed has sent shockwaves through the Horn of Africa. More than 43,000 refugees have fled to Sudan. TPLF rockets have hit the capital of neighbouring Eritrea.
Reuters was unable to reach the TPLF for comment on Friday morning, but two diplomats said fighting raged in several areas outside Mekelle. A resident said the city itself was quiet on Thursday night. The United Nations says 200 aid workers are in the city. 
PAMPHLETS
Finance Minister Ahmed Shide said on Thursday the government was trying to make people in the city aware of the military operation.
""We have made the people of Mekelle to be aware of the operation by deploying military helicopters and dropping pamphlets in Tigrinya and also in Amharic so that they protect themselves against this,"" he told France24.
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said such efforts were not akin to protecting civilians from harm.
He also said on Twitter that ""with evidence mounting of atrocities committed by both sides in Ethiopia's Tigray province, it's essential to send in international investigators now"". 
Rights investigators and civilians fleeing the conflict say fighters from both sides, including civilian militias supporting more formal security forces, have carried out mass killings. Both the government and the TPLF deny their forces were involved. 
Pope Francis renewed a call for an end to the conflict on Friday and for political dialogue to resolve it. A Vatican statement said the pope was praying for the country and appealed to both sides for the protection of civilians.
Abiy's office said on Thursday that authorities were opening a humanitarian access route, but the United Nations said it had no information on that and the region was blocked to aid groups. 
Tigrayans, who make up about 6% of Ethiopia's 115 million population, dominated the government until Abiy took power two years ago. 
Abiy pledged to unite Ethiopians and introduce freedoms after years of state repression that filled jails with tens of thousands of political prisoners. His government also put senior Tigrayan officials on trial for crimes such as corruption, torture and murder. The region saw those trials as discrimination. 

Abiy’s reforms created more political space but also lifted the lid on long-repressed tensions over land and resources.

The effect of the cyclone could also be to let the swarms to move south east to Ogaden region and lay eggs there too, the FAO said.

A government delegation from Tashkent has visited the Al-Hol and Roj camps in the Kurdish-controlled part of Syria and met over 100 Uzbeks staying there to discuss their return home, the source said.
Most of those people are women and children under three years of age who ""live in deplorable conditions and have difficulties with access to drinking water, food and medical care"", according to the source.
Kurdish fighters have seized much of northern and eastern Syria from Islamic State and have since held thousands of militants in prisons, while their wives and children - numbering tens of thousands - are living in camps.
Al-Hol camp alone houses nearly 65,000 people, including about 28,000 Syrians, 30,000 Iraqis and some 10,000 other foreigners of many nationalities, according to U.N. estimates.
UNICEF said in August eight children had died in al-Hol, where it said children from 60 countries were languishing and COVID-19 infections among camp workers had worsened conditions.
Thousands of people from the predominantly Muslim region of Central Asia, where Uzbekistan is the most populous nation, are believed to have joined Islamic State, with men often bringing their families along.

Uzbekistan repatriated 220 women and children from Syria last year who then enrolled in a programme aimed at their rehabilitation, the government has said.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 01:31PM ET</span>",Suspected Iranian nuclear mastermind Fakhrizadeh assassinated near Tehran,"By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) -An Iranian scientist long suspected by the West of masterminding a secret nuclear bomb programme was killed in an ambush near Tehran on Friday that could provoke confrontation between Iran and its foes in the last weeks of Donald Trump's presidency.
The death of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who Iranian state media said died in hospital after armed assassins gunned him down in his car, will also complicate any effort by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to revive the detente of Barack Obama's presidency.
Iran pointed the finger at Israel, with the implication that the killing would have the blessing of the departing Trump.
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted of ""serious indications of Israeli role"" and called on Western countries to ""end their shameful double standards & condemn this act of state terror"".
The military adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to ""strike as thunder at the killers of this oppressed martyr"".
""In the last days of the political life of their ... ally (Trump), the Zionists seek to intensify pressure on Iran and create a full-blown war,"" Hossein Dehghan tweeted.
There was silence from foreign capitals. Israel declined to comment. In the United States, the White House, Pentagon, State Department and CIA all declined to comment. Biden's transition team also declined to comment.
Fakhrizadeh has been described by Western and Israeli intelligence services for years as the leader of a covert atomic bomb programme halted in 2003, which Israel and the United States accuse Tehran of trying to restore in secret. Iran has long denied seeking to weaponise nuclear energy. 
""Unfortunately, the medical team did not succeed in reviving (Fakhrizadeh), and a few minutes ago, this manager and scientist achieved the high status of martyrdom after years of effort and struggle,"" Iran's armed forces said in a statement.
The semi-official news agency Tasnim said ""terrorists blew up another car"" before firing on a vehicle carrying Fakhrizadeh and his bodyguards in an ambush outside the capital.
Regardless of who was responsible for the attack, it is certain to escalate tension between Iran and the United States in the final weeks of Trump's presidency.
Trump, who lost his re-election bid to Biden on Nov. 3 and leaves office on Jan. 20, pulled the United States from a deal reached under Obama, his predecessor, by which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
Biden has said he will aim to restore that agreement, although many analysts say this would not happen overnight, with both sides likely to demand more reassurances.
A U.S. official confirmed earlier this month that Trump had asked military aides for a plan for a possible strike on Iran. Trump decided against it at the time because of the risk it could provoke a wider Middle East conflict.
Last January, Trump ordered a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad that killed Qassem Soleimani, Iran's most powerful military commander. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at a U.S. base in Iraq, the closest the two foes have come to war in decades.
'REMEMBER THAT NAME'
Fakhrizadeh is thought to have headed what the U.N. nuclear watchdog and U.S. intelligence services believe was a coordinated nuclear weapons programme in Iran, shelved in 2003.
He was the only Iranian scientist named in the International Atomic Energy Agency's 2015 ""final assessment"" of open questions about Iran's nuclear programme. The IAEA's report said he oversaw activities ""in support of a possible military dimension to (Iran's) nuclear programme"".
He was a central figure in a presentation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2018 accusing Iran of continuing to seek nuclear weapons. 
""Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh,"" Netanyahu said at the time.
During the final months of Trump's presidency, Israel has been making peace with Gulf Arab states that share its hostility towards Iran.
Earlier this week, Netanyahu travelled to Saudi Arabia and met its crown prince, an Israeli official said, in what would be the first publicly confirmed visit by an Israeli leader. Israeli media said they were joined by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
On Friday, before the news of the attack on Fakhrizadeh emerged, an Israeli official said Israel was discussing with Gulf Arab states how to tackle Iran.
""The story is not Trump, nor even Israel. The story is Iran - the growing dread that a new U.S. administration will go back to the nuclear deal which threatens the very existence of the Gulf countries,"" Tzachi Hanegbi, who sits in Netanyahu's security cabinet, told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM.

""We will know how to handle the issue of the Iranian threat, even if through our own means.""

French prosecutors are investigating the violent arrest of Michel Zecler, who said he was also racially abused by the officers, after CCTV footage of the incident was released. The police watchdog is also investigating.
Four police officers were being held for questioning as part of the investigation, the Paris Prosecutor's office said.
The beating inside the entrance of a building was captured on closed circuit television and mobile phone footage which circulated online.
The alleged attack on Zecler risks inflaming racial tension with allegations of repeated police brutality against Black and ethnic communities at the forefront of many people's minds after the death of Black American George Floyd in Minneapolis in May sparked the ""BlackLivesMatter"" movement.
The arrest of Zecler came amid fierce debate in France over draft legislation that would limit journalists' ability to document French police officers at work. 
Dominique Sopo, President of anti-racism group ""SOS Racisme"" told Reuters Zecler had been the target of a ""racist attack"".
""For police officers to act that way they must have a tremendous feeling of impunity. This situation is a symptom of an impunity that has been going on for too long,"" he added.
Paris police already faced criticism this week after social media photos and videos showed officers hitting protesters as they cleared out an illegal migrants campsite in a central Paris square.
The music producer told reporters he was set upon by police at his studio in Paris's 17th arrondissement on Saturday.
He said he had been walking in the street without a face mask - against French COVID-19 health protocols - and, upon seeing a police car, went into his nearby studio to avoid being fined. However, he said, the police followed him inside and began to assault and racially abuse him.
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told France 2 television on Thursday that the officers would be punished if the alleged wrongdoing was confirmed.
The prime minister's office said on Thursday it would set up an independent commission tasked with proposing a new version of the draft legislation in response to protests and complaints from free expression advocates.
""BlackLivesMatter"" protests broke out in Paris in June following the killing of George Floyd, who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck in the street for nearly nine minutes in the course of arresting him. 
The outrage generated by Floyd's death has resonated in France, in particular in deprived city suburbs where police often clash with youths from ethnic minority backgrounds. 

The protests in Paris in June focused on unsolved cases of people dying during police operations, such as Adama Traore, who died in police detention near Paris in 2016.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilians return to the polls in 57 cities on Sunday for the runoffs of municipal elections that have seen surging violence involving assassinations and physical attacks on candidates.
In two months of campaigning leading up to the first round of voting on Nov. 15, there were 200 murders, attempted murders or otherwise injured candidates, according to Brazilian electoral authority TSE.
That compares to 63 cases of political violence in the first eight months of this election year, and just 46 such cases in the previous municipal elections in 2016, the report by the TSE's security and intelligence unit found.
Violence has always been present in Brazilian politics, especially in the ""wild west"" of poorer northern and northeastern states where powerful landowners occasionally have called on hired guns to settle political disputes.
The violence even reached the national Congress in Brasilia. In 1963, Senator Arnon de Mello from the state of Alagoas pulled out a gun in the chamber to settle a quarrel with an adversary, missing his shot and killing another senator.
In 1993, the Paraiba Governor Ronaldo Cunha Lima shot dead his predecessor for alleging his son was corrupt.
In recent years, experts say violence has become more widespread in a polarized Brazil where more guns are available and new criminal organizations are consolidating power in cities such as Rio de Janeiro. The risks are greater in local politics where crimes often go unpunished, said Felipe Borba, who tracks electoral violence at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
""In smaller districts there is direct confrontation between local rivals. The winner takes all and losing office means you have nothing,"" he said in an interview.
He pointed to two murders in one day. On Sept. 24, three days before campaigning began, a town council candidate in the state of Minas Gerais, Cassio Remis of the centrist Brazilian Social Democratic Party, was assassinated with five shots in a public killing caught on security cameras. The same day in Pernambuco state, another candidate Valter do Conselho from the center-right Democrats (DEM) party also was shot dead.
The violence is hurting all parties, including the right and left.
Four days before the Nov. 15 vote, in the Rio suburb of Nova Iguaçu, local DEM candidate Domingo Cabral, was shot dead by hooded men in a bar. The day before, Mauro da Rocha, of the Christian Workers Party, was murdered in the same town.
The violence continued even after the polls closed. Edmar Santana of the right-wing Patriota party, who had just been elected substitute councilman in Sumaré, a city in Sao Paulo state, died riddled with bullets fired by a man passing on a motor bike. 
""In Rio, there is a pattern. Political violence mainly involves organized crime, drug trafficking or paramilitary militia groups,"" Borba said. 
Many political killings remain unresolved, particularly in the interior of the country where near impunity reigns, he said.
Even high-profile cases do not get fully resolved, such as the 2018 assassination of Rio de Janeiro councilwoman Marielle Franco, a rising politician of the left-wing PSOL party, and her driver.

Despite domestic and international pressure, police to this day have only caught the gunman, former military policeman Ronnie Lessa, but not the mastermind behind Brazil's most high-profile recent political killing.

Central Mali has emerged over the past few years as an epicentre of Islamist and inter-ethnic violence, part of a wider deterioration of security across West Africa's semi-arid Sahel region.
The Malian army said on Oct. 22 that it had regained control of the village after parachuting in troops and air-dropping supplies. But the fighters surrounding the village have not been dislodged, two mayors of nearby towns said.
In recent weeks, militants have carried out attacks and burned crops.
""The farmers who went to their fields to harvest rice were attacked by jihadists. Six were killed, another was wounded, and one is missing,"" Dramane Sympara, mayor of the nearby town of Sokolo, said on Friday.
A spokesman for the Malian army declined to comment.

Lukashenko, who has faced mass protests calling for him to step down since a presidential election on Aug. 9, made the comment a day after Russia's foreign minister told him to press ahead with constitutional reforms to defuse the crisis.
""I will not work as president with you under the new constitution,"" Lukashenko was quoted as saying by the Belta news agency. 
He said the current constitution needed reforming as too much power was concentrated in the hands of the president and that there would be ""trouble"" if he handed over the reins now. 
He made the comments at a hospital treating coronavirus patients, where he donned a white hazmat suit and spoke to patients wearing a face mask, but no gloves. 
Russia, a key ally, has publicly backed Lukashenko's stated intention to reform the constitution, but no proposals have materialised as the political standoff between Lukashenko and his opponents has rumbled on.
Protesters dismiss the reform promises as a stalling tactic. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Lukashenko on Thursday to honour the reform promise as well as other, unspecified agreements made with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in September. 

Lukashenko's actions are being closed watched for clues to what Russia, whose political support is vital for him to stay in power, is pushing him to do.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia formally suspended imports of meat, eggs and other products from Turkey earlier this month, the Turkish exporters' union said, after a months-long informal boycott of Turkish goods over political tensions between the two regional rivals.
Turkish exporters have reported increasing obstacles to trade in Saudi Arabia, as businessmen in the Gulf Arab state have led calls for bans on Turkish imports and as ties between the two countries deteriorated.
Already strained by competing ambitions for regional influence, those relations plunged into crisis two years ago when Saudi agents killed prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Ankara says it has been told by Riyadh that there is no formal boycott, but the exporters' union said it had been informed by Turkey's trade ministry that imports of some Turkish goods had been suspended earlier this month.
""Imports from our country of red meat and products, white meat and products, water products, eggs and honey and their products, as well as milk and... alternatives to breast milk, have been suspended as of November 15,"" the union told its members in an email obtained by Reuters.
No one could be contacted at the Saudi embassy in Ankara on Friday. Turkey's trade ministry was not available for immediate comment. 
Turkey's Exporters Assembly says exports to Saudi Arabia fell 16% in the first 10 months of this year to $2.23 billion.
Turkey's Trade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan said this week that Riyadh insisted there was no official boycott of Turkish goods - something Ankara could formally challenge through the World Trade Organisation.
""... we expect concrete steps to solve problems in our trade and economic relations,"" Pekcan was quoted as saying by Sabah newspaper. ""Our counterparts told us there was no formal decision, that there were some exceptional issues.""
FEELING PAIN
President Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi Arabia's King Salman agreed in a phone call last week to ""keep channels of dialogue open to improve bilateral ties and overcome issues"", the Turkish presidency said.
Both countries have reason to calm tensions as they brace for change under a new U.S. administration. President-elect Joe Biden, who has sharply criticised Erdogan, will face pressure from Congress to sanction Turkey for buying Russian defence equipment and has pledged to reassess ties with Saudi Arabia.
But there has been no immediate sign of Saudi-Turkish rapprochement, and some Turkish businesses say they have been feeling the pain for some months.
""Even though there was no official ban, we were unable to send many products to Saudi Arabia anyway, including chicken products,"" said Sait Koca, general manager of a poultry company.

Weeks of delays on arrival meant that sales of goods such as hatching eggs, which need to be moved quickly, had already collapsed, he said.

ANTWERP, Belgium (Reuters) - An Iranian diplomat and three other Iranians went on trial in Belgium on Friday accused of planning to bomb a meeting of an exiled opposition group in France in 2018, the first time an EU country has put an Iranian official on trial for terrorism.
Belgian prosecutors charged Vienna-based diplomat Assadolah Assadi and the three others with plotting an attack on a rally of the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). The rally's keynote address was given by U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
Assadi, who was arrested while on holiday in Germany and handed over to Belgium, is refusing to appear in court and did not attend the first day of the trial in Antwerp; he has not commented on the charges.
""My client asked me to represent him today, he let me know he has the fullest respect for these judges but as he considers that he should benefit from immunity, they are not allowed to judge him,"" his lawyer Dimitri de Beco told Reuters.
Assadi was the third counsellor at Iran's embassy in Vienna. French officials have said he was in charge of intelligence in southern Europe and was acting on orders from Tehran.
The Islamic Republic has repeatedly dismissed the charges, calling the attack allegations a ""false flag"" stunt by the NCRI, which it considers a terrorist group.
The trial is expected to continue next week, with a possible verdict later this month or in early January, lawyers said. 
Assadi warned authorities in March of possible retaliation by unidentified groups if he is found guilty, according to a police document obtained by Reuters.
Authorities say the attack was thwarted by a coordinated operation between French, German and Belgian security services.
Two of Assadi's suspected accomplices were arrested in Belgium with the explosive TATP and a detonator. Their lawyers said on Friday that neither had any intention to kill.
Lawyers representing participants of the 2018 rally, who are a civil party to the Belgian prosecution, have argued that diplomatic immunity cannot be used as a cover to carry out a terrorist attack, which carries a maximum 20-year prison term.
""I think the words 'brave little Belgium' are entirely appropriate today,"" said Rik Vanreusel, a lawyer for the civil party. ""We are one of the only countries that has dared to put such rather politically sensitive matters in a proper perspective.""
Following a 2015 accord between Iran and world powers to curb Tehran's nuclear programme, the European Union has sought closer diplomatic and economic relations with Tehran, but says it cannot turn a blind eye to human rights abuses or terrorism. 
France has said Iran's intelligence ministry was behind the 2018 plot and it expelled an Iranian diplomat. 

European countries have blamed Iran for other suspected moves against dissidents, including two killings in the Netherlands in 2015 and 2017 and a foiled assassination in Denmark. The Islamic Republic has denied involvement.

GEMBLOUX, Belgium (Reuters) - The exotic animals are confined to small paddocks, the acrobats have been grounded, and the clowns aren't able to make an audience laugh anymore.
The coronavirus has brought the curtain down on the Zavatelli Circus, at least for the time being.
Unable to travel or perform across Europe, the French family-run operation is waiting out the pandemic in a car park in the southern Belgium town of Gembloux - and quickly running out of funds to feed its animals. 
""For us, the confinement is very difficult because we are not working. We have no cash flow,"" said circus director Kevin Dubois.
The Zavatelli Circus typically pitches its 600-seater Big Top in 30 cities each year. But since March, when COVID-19 cases began rising in Europe, it has only been able to perform with a reduced capacity, or not at all during Belgium's spring and autumn lockdowns.
The show features jugglers and acrobats, a conjuror, clowns and a tightrope-walker, and a menagerie including camels, llamas, buffaloes and ponies.
Now the staff are living in trailers in the car park, stopping their skills from going rusty with outdoor pratice sessions in the crisp Autumn air. 
The animals are kept in enclosures under red-and white striped awnings, with straw strewn over the car park's ground.
""Frankly, it is becoming an issue because we have 60 animals to feed,"" Dubois said.
The cost of food for the animals runs to about 500 euros ($600) per week. There are also 23 circus staff to support.
""We don't know how to make ends meet,"" he said. 
The Zavatelli Circus is one of three family operations that date back to 1800 and was once known as the Cirque de Paris. 
The two others, Armanzo and Anderland, owned by the same family, are also on the rented site in Gembloux, about 50 km (30 miles) south of Brussels. 
While the circus could return home to France, it would not be permitted to perform there either.
Belgium, like France, is under its second lockdown since the coronavirus epidemic hit Europe in February. Although shops are expected to reopen soon, cultural operations such as circuses in Belgium must remain closed until further notice. 
Dubois lamented the lack of state financial support. 

""We have not received any financial assistance (from the authorities). A lot of people gave us bread, carrots, they bring us seeds, hay. But in terms of money, we did not get anything,"" Dubois said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of Thai anti-government protesters called for an end to coups in the Southeast Asian country on Friday as months of street protests fuel rumours of another military takeover.
The protesters demand the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader who seized power in the last coup in 2014, but say they do not want him replaced by another general.
Organisers called Friday's protest ""Rehearsal to Oppose a Coup"".
Prayuth's putsch was the 13th successful coup since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932.
""The 14th coup will not happen because the people will come out and resist,"" one of the protest leaders, Panupong “Mike Rayong” Jadnok, told the crowd.
Some protesters burned pictures of Prayuth.
He stayed on as prime minister after an election last year and protesters say the ballot was organised to keep him in power with a constitution drawn up by his former government that gave parliament's entire upper house to junta appointees.
Prayuth says the vote was fair.
""I’m only 18 but have seen two coups already. That’s not right,"" said Tan, a high school student at the protest who gave only one name. ""We don’t want history to repeat itself.""
Both Prayuth and Thailand's army chief, General Narongpan Jittkaewtae, this week dismissed the possibility that another coup was imminent - but that has only increased speculation that one could be on the cards.
""The government has no intention of using martial law or talk about a coup,"" said government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri.
Protesters also accuse the monarchy of enabling decades of military domination and have demanded curbs to the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn - including his power to approve any future coups.
The Royal Palace has made no comments on the protesters although the king said recently that they were loved ""all the same"".

At least seven of the most prominent protest leaders face charges of insulting the monarchy, which could carry jail terms of up to 15 years, for comments they have made at different protests.

The 12, who had all faced charges in Hong Kong linked to anti-government protests, have been held virtually incommunicado in a mainland prison since they were detained at sea, apparently while trying to reach the democratic island of Taiwan. 
A relative of one of the detainees told Reuters on Friday she doubted the fairness of the legal process for the 12. They face charges of illegal border crossing and organising an illicit border crossing, which could carry a sentence of up to seven years in jail, mainland authorities said.
""The investigation of 12 Hong Kong people who were found unlawfully crossing the border has ended,"" authorities in Yantian district of the southern mainland city of Shenzhen said.
The 11 men and one woman were captured by the Chinese coastguard on Aug. 23. The youngest is 16.
In a joint statement, families of seven of the detainees said this month their lawyers, chosen from a list provided by Chinese authorities, passed on letters similar in content, all describing good conditions in prison and urging their families and neighbors back home not to worry.
The families said they were suspicious of the praise in the letters describing how well they had been treated in prison.
Beatrice Li, sister of Andy Li, one of the detained, told Reuters on Friday: ""It is not a fair legal process that they are undergoing.""
The father of detainee Cheng Tsz-ho said: ""The faster the trial, the faster we can know how long they will be detained ... I hope we can ... have a fair and just judicial trial.”
Their case has attracted a lot of interest in the former British colony as a rare instance of Chinese authorities arresting people trying to leave at a time of growing fears about prospects for the city's high degree of autonomy.
All of the 12 had faced charges in Hong Kong linked to an anti-government protest movement, including rioting and violation of a contentious national security law that China imposed in June.

Authorities have denied family and lawyers access to the 12, insisting they be represented by officially appointed lawyers.

Rusesabagina, a political dissident who has lived in exile in Belgium and the United States, was arrested in August after returning to the country.
At the time it was not immediately clear whether he had returned voluntarily or had been coerced. 
""I was kidnapped to come here,"" Rusesabagina said in court in the capital, Kigali, as he applied for bail. 
""...They tied my legs and my arms and I was blindfolded.""
Prosecutors denied he had been kidnapped and said due process had been followed.
""No one kidnapped Paul Rusesabagina...he was detained at a legally recognised place after being notified of charges against him,"" prosecutor Jean Cabin Habimana said.
The Oscar-nominated 2004 film ""Hotel Rwanda"" depicted Rusesabagina, played by Don Cheadle, using his connections as a hotel manager to protect ethnic Tutsis fleeing slaughter by Hutus in the country's 1994 genocide. 
An estimated 800,000 people were killed. 
Rusesabagina later acquired Belgian citizenship and became a U.S. resident. 
He became a vocal critic of President Paul Kagame and once called for armed resistance to the government in a YouTube video.
In court, his lawyer, Gatera Gashabana, said Rusesabagina had been held incommunicado and his rights violated. 
Rusesabagina has already been denied bail twice. [L8N2GT3U7]

The judge said he would deliver his ruling on the most recent application on Dec. 2.

Belarus has been rocked by months of anti-government protests after veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in an Aug. 9 presidential election that his opponents say was rigged, a charge he denies.
Western countries have accused Belarusian security forces of using excessive force in their crackdown on the protesters and have imposed sanctions targeting specific officials.
Tsikhanouskaya's supporters now want European prosecutors to issue international arrest warrants for officials named in their petitions.
""It's terrible in Belarus, and I don't think anything similar is happening anywhere in Europe. We need outside help"", Maksim Kharoshyn told a news conference in Vilnius, saying he had been beaten by Belarusian police while in detention.
A petition filed with Lithuanian prosecutors on Kharoshyn's behalf asks them to investigate several officials including Belarusian Deputy Interior Minister Nikolai Karpenkov in the case, said Alexander Dobrovolski, an adviser to Tsikhanouskaya.
Dobrovolski said similar requests would be sent to prosecutors in Poland, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, where other alleged victims of Belarusian police beatings now reside.
Belarus denies torturing prisoners and says its police show restraint in dealing with protesters it has said are in league with hostile foreign powers.
Lithuania's criminal code punishes state-sanctioned torture by up to five years in jail. It allows for the prosecution of foreigners for crimes allegedly committed outside the country.
Tsikhanouskaya, who says she won the August presidential election, is now based in the Lithuanian capital but was not at Friday's news conference.

Mourners in traditional white garments, mostly wearing masks, wept and waved national flags ahead of prayers for the two-time prime minister, who was a central figure in Sudan's political and spiritual life for more than half a century.
""Today the icon of tolerance in Sudan has passed away, a symbol of civilian jihad in Sudan, a warrior knight,"" one mourner, Abd al-Rahman al-Zein, told Sudanese TV through tears.
Stewards moved through the crowds gathered before the domed shrine where he was to be buried offering hand sanitiser to mourners as a precaution against COVID-19, but there was little sign of social distancing. Mahdi's Umma Party had urged mourners on Thursday to follow all health procedures.
Oxford-educated Mahdi, great-grandson of the messianic figure who fought the British in the 19th century, contracted COVID-19 last month and had been receiving treatment in the United Arab Emirates.
""The scenes broadcast on television of the funeral despite the health conditions... indicate the extent of the popularity and political weight that the late Imam enjoyed,"" said Rasha Awad, editor of Al Taghyeer online newspaper.
""Mahdi was known for his moderation and realistic reading of the Sudanese political arena... His absence will inevitably weaken the democratic transition process,"" she added.
NATIONAL MOURNING
Some mourners said they had come from various regions of the vast north African country to bid farewell to Mahdi. The government has declared three days of national mourning.
Mahdi's body arrived at Khartoum airport on Friday morning, where the head of the ruling sovereign council, the prime minister and other top officials attended an official reception.
The coffin then moved to Omdurman, the capital's twin city across the river Nile, for the funeral, state TV reported.
His body was buried alongside his great-grandfather, the Mahdi, or messiah, who had led an insurgency against British colonial rule in the late 1800s.
Sudan is run by a transitional government formed under a fragile three-year power sharing agreement between the military and civilian groups since the ousting of Omar Hassan al-Bashir in 2019. 
Mahdi had been trying to bridge the gap between the military and civilian leaders, Awad said.
He was last voted into office in 1986, then overthrown three years later in a military coup led by Bashir, then an obscure army brigadier.
Mahdi was imprisoned and forced into exile often during his long career but staged just as many come-backs and remained influential. His Umma Party was one of the largest opposition groups during Bashir's 30-year rule.

He returned from exile a final time as protests over worsening economic conditions gathered steam in December 2018. Those demonstrations eventually led to Bashir's overthrow in April 2019.

187,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Analysis: Covert Israeli-Saudi meeting sends Biden a strong message on Iran,"RIYADH/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A historic meeting between Israel's prime minister and Saudi Arabia's crown prince has sent a strong signal to allies and enemies alike that the two countries remain deeply committed to containing their common foe Iran.
Last Sunday's covert meeting in the Saudi city of Neom, confirmed by Israeli officials but publicly denied by Riyadh, conveyed a coordinated message to U.S. President-elect Joe Biden that Washington's main allies in the region are closing ranks.
It was the first publicly confirmed visit to Saudi Arabia by an Israeli leader and a meeting that was unthinkable until recently as the two countries do not have formal diplomatic relations. But it underlines the depth of the two countries' concerns about Iran, and shows how opposition to Tehran is bringing about a strategic realignment of countries in the Middle East.
""It's Iran, Iran, Iran,"" Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israel's Army Radio when asked about the visit. ""It is very, very important to create the axis which isolates Iran.""
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu both enjoyed strong support from U.S. President Donald Trump and championed his ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Iran. 
They fear Biden will adopt policies on Iran similar to those adopted during Barak Obama's U.S. presidency which strained Washington's ties with its traditional regional allies. 
Biden has said he will rejoin the international nuclear pact with Iran that Trump quit in 2018 - and work with allies to strengthen its terms - if Tehran first resumes strict compliance.
Both Israel and Saudi Arabia have recently ramped up rhetoric against Iran, which is locked in several proxy wars with Riyadh in the region.
Iran has built a network of armed Shi'ite militias across the Arab world, from Iraq to Syria and Lebanon and down into the Gulf and Yemen. Tehran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked Saudi oil installations last week, the latest in a string of attacks on Saudi targets.
Israel is waging a shadow war against Iranian forces, mostly through regular air raids in Syria on Lebanese Shi'ite paramilitary group Hezbollah, on Iran's Revolutionary Guard, and on supplies of weapons as they are moved across the country.
SAUDI KING NOT INFORMED
Sunday's meeting was held in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Israel's spy chief, Israeli media said.
Pompeo, who has been trying to coax Saudi Arabia to follow the lead of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan in normalising ties with Israel, declined to confirm the meeting. But diplomats in the region said U.S. envoys had privately confirmed the meeting took place.
Netanyahu declined comment on the meeting. He has yet to visit the UAE and Bahrain since formal ties were established, with tacit approval from Gulf powerhouse Saudi Arabia. 
On Thursday, he said he expected more countries to normalise ties with Israel in the next few months. 
There was limited talk of the meeting on Saudi social media, but some opposition figures denounced the visit. Political analysts said the Saudi denial of the meeting could have been a way to test the waters at home.
Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, has softened its stance on Israel in recent years, but signalled it is not yet ready to officially normalise ties, which analysts say would be a difficult move for King Salman in the absence of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.
""(The meeting with Netanyahu) aimed to highlight that MbS (Mohammed bin Salman) is more willing than his father to take steps towards normalisation without first reaching a two-state solution,"" said Neil Quilliam, Associate Fellow at Chatham House think tank.
Despite this, normalisation is not expected to happen while King Salman is alive, said a well-connected Saudi source and a foreign diplomat in Riyadh. 
""Normalisation ... is a carrot to get (Biden's) focus away from other issues, especially (Saudi) human rights,"" the diplomat said.
The Saudi source and the diplomat said the Saudi king was kept in the dark about Netanyahu's visit. 
Although the king chaired last weekend's virtual G20 leaders' summit, rumours of his declining health have swirled since he was admitted to hospital this summer.
A video was leaked during the G20 summit which showed MbS correcting the confused king's recollection, a leak which sources said was intentional.
The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ISRAELI LEAK
The leak of Prince Mohammed's meeting with Netanyahu may have been intentional from Israel: an executive jet was used for the direct flight from Tel Aviv, which was quickly spotted on open-source flight trackers, and Israeli censors made no efforts to quash reporting on the trip.
The leak gave Netanyahu an opportunity to embarrass his political rival, Defence Minister Benny Gantz, who is due to take over as prime minister a year from now under a power-sharing agreement.
    It included news that Netanyahu had not informed Gantz about the flight, in effect implying to Israeli voters that the centrist politician cannot be trusted to keep a secret, following speculation that an early election is on the cards.
    Gantz called the leak ""irresponsible"".

    Netanyahu has acknowledged he also kept Gantz in the dark about secret negotiations with the UAE that led to normalisation.

There was no immediate word on possible casualties.
The reported air strikes came after a Houthi missile attack on Saudi oil facilities in the Red Sea city of Jeddah.
Saudi-led coalition forces intervened in Yemen's war in March 2015 to restore the Yemeni government ousted from power in Sanaa by the Houthis in late 2014. 
Houthi forces have staged many missile and drone strikes on civilian airports and oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, including on the capital Riyadh.

Abiy, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade standoff with Eritrea, has said he will not talk with TPLF leaders until they are defeated or give up.
Thousands of people are already believed to have died amid air strikes and ground fighting since the war began on Nov. 4. The U.N. estimates 1.1 million Ethiopians will need aid as a result of the conflict.
The conflict has sent shockwaves through the Horn of Africa. More than 43,000 refugees have fled to Sudan. TPLF rockets have hit the capital of neighbouring Eritrea.
Reuters was unable to reach the TPLF for comment on Friday morning, but two diplomats said fighting raged in several areas outside Mekelle. 
With phone and internet connections shut off to the region and access to the area tightly controlled, verifying claims by all sides has been impossible.
TRENCHES
There was no indication that the Ethiopian military had entered the city of Mekelle. The TPLF has previously said it was digging trenches around the city. Reuters was unable to verify those claims. 
Finance Minister Ahmed Shide said on Thursday that the government was trying to make people in the city aware of the military operation.
""We have made the people of Mekelle to be aware of the operation by deploying military helicopters and dropping pamphlets in Tigrinya and also in Amharic so that they protect themselves against this,"" he told France24.
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said such efforts were not akin to protecting civilians from harm.
""Warnings don't absolve the Ethiopian military of the duty to protect civilians during military operations in urban areas,"" Roth tweeted on Thursday. Urging the TPLF not to deploy its forces among civilian populations in the city of Mekelle, he added: ""Violations by one side don't justify violations by the other."" 
Abiy's office said on Thursday that authorities were opening a humanitarian access route, but the U.N. said it had no information on the route and the region was blocked to aid groups. 
Tigrayans, who make up about 6% of Ethiopia's 115 million-strong population, dominated the government until Abiy took power two years ago. 
Pledging to unite Ethiopians and introduce freedoms after years of state repression, Abiy jailed senior Tigrayan officials. The region saw that as discrimination. 
Abiy accuses Tigrayan leaders of starting the war by attacking federal troops at a base in Tigray three weeks ago. The TPLF have described the attack as a pre-emptive strike. 
Tigrayan forces have large stocks of military hardware and number up to 250,000 men, experts say, while the region has a history of guerrilla resistance.

Even before war broke out, as resentment in Tigray against the federal government grew, Tigrayans adopted a slogan from the TPLF: ""nobody will kneel down"".

Authorities said they had to intervene due to violations of hygiene protocols to prevent coronavirus spread. The group said this was an ""absurd"" pretext for ending a protest that shone a spotlight on rights abuses in the one-party state.
""They entered by force, breaking the door,"" said independent journalist Iliana Hernandez in a video livestreamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""Many military people as if they were doctors wearing gowns.""
Hernandez said police had detained her and others before taking them to their homes. Around an hour after midnight, the group said three of the 14 detained were still out of contact.
The San Isidro Movement had been little known before it publicized the protest on social media, uniting Cuba's normally fractious opposition groups in sympathy and drawing criticism of authorities by human rights group such as Amnesty International.
The movement was founded in 2018 to oppose a new decree limiting freedom of speech, often through irreverent artistic performances, and it has had numerous run-ins with Cuba's Communist authorities that frown on public dissent.
After group members protested against an eight-month jail sentence for rapper Denis Solis on charges of contempt, security forces besieged its headquarters earlier this month.
Eight members and supporters of the movement then declared a hunger strike and said some were not drinking water either. Reuters could not independently verify this as security forces blocked access to the premises.
Coming amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, the events have galvanized some Cubans who usually shy away from talking politics to criticize the government's handling of the situation.
Prominent Cuban artists like musicians Carlos Varela and Haydee Milanes and filmmakers Carlos Lechuga and Claudia Calvino called for the government to show tolerance.
""We called for dialogue,"" Milanes wrote on Facebook on Thursday night. ""We have not been listened to.""
The activists who had already been freed on Thursday night vowed to keep on fighting. ""Denis Solis remains imprisoned,"" critically acclaimed writer Carlos Manuel Alvarez wrote on Facebook. ""We cannot leave him alone.""
The government said it was the fact Alvarez joined the strikers without notifying authorities of his change of address shortly after arriving in the country from the United States that prompted it to take action on Thursday.
A member of the San Isidro Movement, Michel Matos, said if it were truly worried about coronavirus, it would not have simply allowed him and most the others to go home.
The government says dissidents are mercenaries seeking to destabilize Cuba and earlier this week state-run media published articles calling the strike a show orchestrated from Miami and Washington.

On Thursday, the European Union's parliament agreed a non-binding resolution in support of EU member Cyprus urging EU leaders to ""take action and impose tough sanctions"" against Turkey, a move likely to bolster support for France's push for sanctions on Ankara at an EU summit next month.
Turkey is at odds with EU members Greece and Cyprus over hydrocarbon exploration in disputed east Mediterranean waters. 
Erdogan incensed Cyprus, whose territory covers the southern half of the partitioned Mediterranean island, on Nov. 15 by visiting Varosha, a resort on the island that has been fenced-off and abandoned in no-man's land since 1974. 
Ankara supported the partial reopening of Varosha last month in a move criticised by the United States, Greece and Greek Cypriots.
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy denounced the resolution and accused the European Parliament of being ""prejudiced and disconnected from the realities"" on Cyprus.
""If this approach and mentality are maintained, it would not be possible for EU bodies to make a constructive contribution to the settlement of the Cyprus issue,"" Aksoy said.
Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Only Ankara recognises northern Cyprus as an independent state, but not the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government to the south. 

France has not yet drawn up sanctions against Turkey, but diplomats say any measures would probably target areas of Turkey's economy linked to natural gas exploration in seas off the coast of Cyprus.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>","Analysis: How attempts to unify Ethiopia may be deepening its divides, say analysts","By Katharine Houreld and Maggie Fick
NAIROBI/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's political slogan is ""medemer"" - or ""coming together"". But some analysts say reforms meant to unify Ethiopia have inflamed simmering ethnic and political divisions and risk unravelling Africa's second most populous nation.
Now Ethiopian unity faces its severest test yet: since Nov. 4, the military has been battling a group that once dominated the national government - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) in the northern Tigray region.
The TPLF frames the conflict as a battle for the rights of Ethiopia's 10 regions against a premier bent on centralising power. They say Abiy has discriminated against Tigrayans since he came to power and have referred to his rule as an ""illegal, unitarist and personalistic dictatorship"".
The government denies trying to centralise control. 
Three major decisions infuriated the TPLF, which dominated the governing coalition for nearly three decades until Abiy came to power in 2018: Abiy's rapprochement with their arch-enemy, the nation of Eritrea; his replacement of an ethnically based coalition with a new national party; and the postponement of national elections.Each sparked bitter recriminations from the TPLF. The ensuing conflict has sent ripples through the region.
Ethiopia, a regional heavyweight, is home to the African Union; its security forces serve in peacekeeping missions in Somalia and South Sudan and work alongside Western allies against Islamist militants.Leenco Lata, a veteran opposition leader, said the federal system is under pressure from both sides as debate polarises between supporters of closer unity or separation. Abiy says he's tried to work with the TPLF, but has been repeatedly rebuffed; his office published a timeline of such attempts this week. 
The government says Tigrayan forces started the conflict by attacking federal troops stationed there. The TPLF have described the attack as a pre-emptive strike. 
Underlying the political struggle are long-standing rivalries between Ethiopia's 80-plus ethnic groups. Many regional leaders see Abiy's democratic reforms as a chance to grab more power for their own group. Zemelak Ayele, a professor at Addis Ababa University, said even though citizens resented the previous repression, the TPLF might have grudging support from some regional leaders who consider it a bulwark against a more centralised government.""Even those who are ardent detractors of TPLF are not necessarily ardent supporters of the war (in Tigray),"" he said. ""Some might feel the federal system might be in danger if the TPLF is out of the picture.""
AN OLD ENMITY AND A NEW PEACE
The secretive, highly militarised nation of Eritrea - often nicknamed ""Africa's North Korea"" - lies along Ethiopia's northern border. Eritrea won independence from Ethiopia in 1991 following three decades of war. Conflict over a border dispute broke out again from 1998-2000; tens of thousands died.
The TPLF spearheaded that war. They regard Eritrea as an arch-enemy.
Months after Abiy came to power, he signed a peace deal with Eritrea in 2018 and was subsequently awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. Regular visits began between Abiy and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, drawing accusations from the TPLF that Abiy was ""serving as a vehicle for Isaias’s desire to extract a pound of flesh for perceived wrongs"".
Billene Seyoum, Abiy's spokeswoman, said the TPLF was trying to ""internationalise the conflict"" and that intelligence reports suggested the TPLF had been manufacturing Eritrean and Ethiopian army uniforms. 
The TPLF has fired missiles at its capital Asmara and says Eritrea is now fighting alongside Ethiopian troops in Tigray, which Ethiopia denies.
Reuters has not been able to reach the Eritrean government for comment for two weeks.
THE PROSPERITY PARTY
After the Eritrea treaty, Abiy consolidated domestically. Last year he replaced Ethiopia's old ruling coalition, made up of four ethnically based parties, with a single pan-Ethiopian party. Out of the four, only the TPLF refused to join.
Abiy underestimated the TPLF's bitterness at losing power, said one Ethiopian academic.
""It is a bitter divorce and Abiy did not have a plan for a peaceful exit for TPLF,"" the academic said, speaking anonymously to avoid angering the government.
Inflammatory rhetoric on both sides made Tigrayan people feel under siege, boosting support for the TPLF, he said.
Alex de Waal, a professor at Tufts University, said launching the new party so quickly may have been a miscalculation: the old coalition had become a rare forum for negotiation in a nation where political dissent often meant prison.
But Abiy was in a hurry. National elections were due in August 2020 and his new party needed to compete against a plethora of new ethnically based groups.
Then the pandemic arrived.
DELAYED ELECTIONS
The government postponed elections. Many opposition groups reluctantly agreed, but not the TPLF. They held their regional elections in September anyway. Both sides accused each other of ignoring the constitution. 
The TPLF won by a landslide. The House of Federation, a legislative body dealing with constitutional matters, voted to cut Tigray's budget.
On Oct. 29, Tigrayan forces refused to let an Ethiopian general who flew into the regional airport leave to take up his command in the capital Mekelle. 
On Nov. 4, the government reported Tigrayan soldiers attacked a base in Dansha.

The conflict had begun.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of Indian farmers scuffled with police on Friday as they tried to march to the capital, Delhi, in protest against new laws liberalising procurement that they say will leave them vulnerable to big companies.
Police fired tear gas at some places on the outskirts of Delhi and used water cannons at entry points to stop people coming into the city centre from the big farming state of Punjab. 
Television showed plumes of smoke and some people throwing stones at police as thousands pressed against barricades, waving flags and sticks. Some rode tractors near the barriers. 
""Although the police have tried to stop us with force, barricades and water cannons, we've decided to stay the course to make sure the government listens to the voice of millions of farmers,"" said protesting farmer Sukrampal Dhayana.
Under the laws enacted in September that Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a watershed for agriculture, farmers are free to sell their produce anywhere, including to big corporate buyers, instead of at government-regulated wholesale markets where farmers are assured of a minimum procurement price.
Many farmer organisations oppose the new law, saying it would leave small growers with little bargaining power. They also say they fear the government will eventually withdraw price support for wheat and rice.
The government says there is no plan to eliminate the wholesale markets.
ACTING TOUGH
As tensions rose, the Delhi police said it had urged the farmers to pull back in line with coronavirus restrictions in the capital under which large gatherings are not allowed.
At the Sindhu checkpoint on the highway leading to Delhi, hundreds of farmers sat down for a long wait. 
Kulwant Singh, a 70-year-old farmer from Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, said his group had brought rations for six months and even cooking gas cylinders and were prepared to camp there until farmers were allowed in to Delhi. 
""We are not going back,"" he said. 
Farmers make up a powerful voting block across India and some leaders urged the Modi government not to crush the protests with an iron hand. 
Senior cabinet ministers should talk to farmers' organisations to understand their apprehensions over the new rules passed by the government, the leaders of the United Farmers Forum said in a letter to Modi.
The government says the new law is aimed at making the vast agriculture sector more efficient by freeing up farmers who want to sell directly to big retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
Farm Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told ANI, a Reuters affiliate that he had already invited farm leaders for talks next week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon said an independence referendum that could wrench apart the United Kingdom after Brexit should take place in the earlier part of the devolved parliament's next term, which begins next year.
If there was another referendum and if Scots voted out, it would mark the biggest shock to the United Kingdom since Irish independence a century ago - just as London grapples with the impact of Brexit.
The pro-independence Scottish National Party leader said she anticipates that a vote will take place ""in the earlier part"" of the next Scottish parliament, which begins next year.
""The referendum for a whole variety of reasons should be in the earlier part of the next parliament,"" Scottish First Minister Sturgeon told the BBC.
Scots voted 55-45 percent against independence in a 2014 referendum but both Brexit and the British government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis have bolstered support for independence among Scots.
The past 14 opinion surveys have shown that Scots support independence. Those surveys show support ranging from 51-59% though views on independence have been volatile over previous years with most polls in 2017-2019 showing Scots opposed to breaking up the United Kingdom. 
Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP) is expected to perform strongly in elections to the Scottish parliament in May. The SNP will argue that winning that election would be a mandate for another independence referendum.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the 2014 independence referendum was decisive and a once in a generation event, so should be respected. His government says there should not be another independence referendum in the near future.
But if Sturgeon wins the May 6 Scottish election, Johnson will have a difficult choice: refuse a referendum and thus allow Scottish discontent to simmer or allow a referendum which could break apart the union he says is so dear to him and his party.
The nations of Britain have shared the same monarch since James VI of Scotland became James I of England in 1603 and a formal union created the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.
Today, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

The United Kingdom as whole voted 52-48 to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum: England and Wales voted to leave but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.

Denmark ordered all farmed mink to be culled early this month after finding that a mutated coronavirus, which infected 12 people, showed decreased sensitivity to antibodies, potentially lowering the efficacy of any vaccines.
Less than two weeks after thousands of mink were buried at a military area in western Denmark, hundreds of them have resurfaced from the sandy soil after starting to decay, according to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration.
The mink were buried in trenches about 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) deep and covered with about 2 metres of soil, it said.
The mass graves are guarded 24 hours a day to keep people and animals away from the graves until a fence has been constructed, it said.
Authorities say there is no risk of the graves spreading the coronavirus, but residents have complained about the potential risk of contaminating drinking water and a bathing lake less than 200 metres from the mass graves.
Several lawmakers have criticised the hasty culling and have call for the dead minks to be dug up and taken to a waste incinerator, the Jyllands-Posten newspaper reported on Friday.

President Tsai Ing-wen announced in August that the government would, from Jan. 1, allow imports of U.S. pork containing ractopamine, an additive that enhances leanness but is banned in the European Union and China, as well as U.S. beef more than 30 months old.
While welcomed in Washington, and removing a roadblock to a long sought after U.S. free trade deal for Taiwan, the KMT has strongly opposed the decision, tapping into public concern about food safety after several high-profile scandals in recent years.
Since the latest session of parliament began in mid-September the KMT has protested against the pork decision by blocking Premier Su Tseng-chang from delivering regular reports and taking questions by occupying the podium where he speaks.
Fed up with the paralysis, the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) decided they were going to ensure Su could speak on Friday, and formed a protective barrier around him as he made his way in, as KMT lawmakers blew whistles, held banners and sounded air horns.
As Su began speaking, KMT lawmakers threw buckets of pig guts his way, and some exchanged blows, with a short but vicious encounter between a group of KMT legislators and Chen Po-wei from the small Taiwan Statebuilding Party.
Su soon withdrew, but later got back up to try and take questions, his words drowned out by KMT lawmakers. 
The DPP condemned the protests, saying in a statement the throwing of the pig guts was a waste of food that ""stank up"" the parliament floor and was ""disgusting"", calling for a return to rational debate.
The KMT says the pork decision has been rushed through and is a health threat, charges the DPP denies.
""In order to protect people's health and protect the bottom line of food safety, the opposition party cannot but resist,"" the KMT said of Friday's protest.

Taiwan is a rambunctious democracy and fighting is not uncommon in parliament.

PARIS (Reuters) - An Iranian diplomat and three other Iranians go on trial in Antwerp, Belgium on Friday for planning to bomb a 2018 meeting in France of an exiled opposition group, the first time an EU country has put an Iranian official on trial for terrorism.
Belgian prosecutors charged Vienna-based diplomat Assadolah Assadi and the three others with planning an attack on a rally of the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). The rally's keynote address was given by U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Assadi was the third counsellor at Iran's embassy in Vienna. French officials have said he was in charge of intelligence in southern Europe and was acting on orders from Tehran.
Tehran has repeatedly dismissed the charges, calling the attack allegations a ""false flag"" stunt by the NCRI, which it considers a terrorist group.
Assadi has not commented on the charges. His lawyer has said Assadi would explain himself at his trial. Assadi warned authorities in March of possible retaliation by unidentified groups if he is found guilty, according to a police document obtained by Reuters.
Authorities say the attack was thwarted by a coordinated operation between French, German and Belgian security services.
Assadi was arrested while on holiday in Germany and handed over to Belgium, where two of his suspected accomplices had been arrested with half a kilo of the explosive TATP and a detonator.
According to documents reviewed by Reuters, Belgian authorities believe Assadi brought the explosives from Tehran to Vienna on a commercial flight.
""The attack plan was conceived in the name of Iran and under its leadership. It was not a personal initiative by Assadi,"" Jaak Raes, head of the Belgium’s state security service (VSSE), said in a letter to the prosecutor dated Feb. 2, 2020.
France said Iran's intelligence ministry was behind the plot and expelled an Iranian diplomat. The EU froze the assets of an Iranian intelligence unit and officials.
European countries have blamed Iran for other suspected plots against dissidents, including two killings in the Netherlands in 2015 and 2017 and a foiled assassination in Denmark. Iran has denied involvement, saying the accusations were intended to damage EU-Iran relations.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Lawyer Nisha Rao maneuvers among the throng of black-coated attorneys clustered near Karachi's city courts searching for her client.
But Rao, 28, is not just another lawyer running for a meeting. As Pakistan's first transgender lawyer, she has carved a path from the streets to the courtroom and her example is inspiring other transgender people in the conservative Islamic Republic. 
""I am proud to have become Pakistan first transgender lawyer"", Rao told Reuters.
Life is hard for transgender persons in Pakistan, where the Supreme Court only allowed them to claim a third gender on their national identity cards in 2009. The parliament just passed a law in 2018 recognising transgender people as equal citizen and protecting them from discrimination and violence.
Treated as outcasts, many transgender persons are victims of sexual assault and resort to working as wedding dancers or begging to make a living.
Rao also ended up begging on the streets after running away from her middle class home in the eastern city of Lahore when she was 18 with two other transgender persons.
Arriving in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, the elder transgender people she sought refuge with advised her to beg or become a sex worker to survive.
Rao stood at traffic lights begging from car to car but was determined to escape that path, eventually using her income to pay for law classes at night. 
After several years, she earned a law degree, gaining her law license earlier this year and joining the Karachi Bar Association.
She has contested 50 cases and is working with a non-governmental organisation fighting for transgender rights.
Rao has broadened her clientele to include non-transgender persons 
“As my case pertains to harassment, I feel that Rao can represent me best since transgenders are subjected to frequent harassment in our society,” said Jeya Alvi, 34, an office secretary meeting Rao for a consultation.
A 2017 census counted 10,418 transgender people out of 207 million in the country, but rights group Charity Trans Action Pakistan estimates there are at least 500,000.
""Rao used to beg here along with us, today she is better than many. But she still helps us, she even responds at midnight (if we contact her),"" said Nayab, a transgender beggar who goes by one name.
Rao has even bigger aspirations than becoming an attorney. 

“My goal is to become Pakistan’s first transgender judge,” she said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has told 13 special forces soldiers they face dismissal in relation to a report on alleged unlawful killings in Afghanistan, the head of the country's army said on Friday.
An independent report published last week in redacted form said there was evidence that 39 unarmed Afghan prisoners and civilians were killed by 19 Australian soldiers.
None of the 19 soldiers were identified in the report, which was written by a state judge appointed by the inspector-general of defence. The 19 current and former soldiers have been referred for possible prosecution.
Under mounting pressure, Lieutenant General Rick Burr, the head of the Australian army, said 13 current soldiers have been issued with notices that could eventually lead to their termination.
Burr did not identify any of the 13 soldiers, but said they were not part of the 19 current and former soldiers who face possible criminal charges. He said the 13 soldiers that face dismissal have two weeks to respond to the notice.
""At this time, 13 individuals have been issued administrative action notices in relation to the Afghanistan inquiry,"" Burr told reporters in Canberra.
""We are all committed to learning from the inquiry and emerging from this a stronger, more capable and effective army.""
Australia’s most senior military official apologised to Afghanistan last week after the release of the report.
The report into the conduct of special forces personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016 said senior commandos may have forced junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to ""blood"" them for combat.
The inquiry examined more than 20,000 documents and 25,000 images, and interviewed 423 witnesses under oath.
Australia sent troops to join U.S.-led forces that tried to defeat the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan in the years after the Islamists were forced from power in 2001.

Last summer's bush fires, which Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Australia's ""black summer"", killed 33 people and billions of native animals.
The country's weather bureau attributed a slight weakening in the current La Nina weather phenomenon as one of the reasons for intense spring heat this year, as scant rainfall in November led to a rise in temperatures in the inland regions. 
""November has been quite unusual in many ways. We have only seen about half our normal rainfall and it is quite possible November will be one of our hottest Novembers on record,"" said Andrew Watkins, the Bureau of Meteorology's (BoM) Head of Climate Operations.
BoM still expects a wetter than usual end to the year from La Nina, which is typically associated with greater rainfall and cooler than average temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
The heat wave sweeping in from Australia's outback interior is forecast to move across the southeast of the country and by early next week will shift to the northeast. Most of Sydney is expected to experience sweltering temperatures above 40 degree Celsius over the weekend.
Last summer's prolonged bush fire season was fuelled by three years of drought but this year the risk is from grasslands after the prolific growth of vegetation helped by good rains in early spring.
""Grass might be greener in the area where you're right now, but it won't take long for it to dry out once the heat of summer starts to appear,"" said Richard Thornton, Chief Executive of Bushfire and Natural Hazard Cooperative Research Centre.
Australia's fire season usually runs from late southern hemisphere spring through summer.

Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a specialist in Middle East politics at the University of Melbourne, was released from prison in exchange for three Iranians who had been detained abroad, Iran's state broadcaster IRIB reported.
Australia and Iran took more than six months to come to an agreement for a prisoner-swap deal for Moore-Gilbert, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison, the Sydney Morning Herald said, citing unidentified sources.
The prisoner exchange deal - which Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday repeatedly declined to comment on - also involved high-level negotiations with the Thailand government, the report said.
Thai authorities disclosed three Iranians who were arrested in 2012 had been deported and sent to Iran. The New York Times reported the three Iranians had been held in Thailand over a bomb plot. 
Australia and Moore-Gilbert have rejected Iran's allegations that she was working as a spy for Israel.

Australia's foreign affairs ministry declined to comment on the report citing privacy reasons for Moore-Gilbert and her family, while the Israeli Embassy in Australia did not respond to requests seeking comments.

Russia said its Sputnik V vaccine is 92% effective at protecting people from COVID-19, according to interim trial results, while AstraZeneca said its COVID-19 vaccine was 70% effective in pivotal trials and could be up to 90% effective.
""If they go for a new clinical trial, we suggest trying a regimen of combining the AZ shot with the #SputnikV human adenoviral vector shot to boost efficacy,"" the developers of the Russian vaccine said on their Twitter account.
""Combining vaccines may prove important for revaccinations.""
AstraZeneca has said it will have as many as 200 million doses of its vaccine by the end of 2020. 
The British developed vaccine is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures. 
With 2,187,990 infections, Russia has the fourth-largest number of COVID-19 cases in the world behind the United States, India and Brazil. 
AstraZeneca is likely to run an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its vaccine, its chief executive Pascal Soriot was quoted as saying by Bloomberg News, after questions were raised over the results from its late-stage study.
The British government's Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said the main point about the AstraZeneca vaccine was that it worked, when asked about these doubts.

""The headline result is the vaccine works and that's very exciting,"" Vallance said during a news briefing with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Iraqi military is training a former member of an Iran-backed militia, who is under U.S. sanctions for killing protesters, to become a high-ranking officer in the army, according to six government, security and militia officials.
They said that Hussein Falih Aziz, known as Abu Zainab al-Lami, had been sent to Egypt with Iraqi officers for a year-long training normally reserved for the country's military personnel.
A defence ministry document seen by Reuters showed his name, with the rank Major General, on a list of officers attending the training until next summer.
Making Lami a senior officer in the army is one of the boldest moves yet by Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, a U.S. ally, to dilute the power of Iran-backed militias in Iraq, the officials said, and aligns with Washington's stated desire to curtail Tehran's influence across the Middle East.
An Iraqi government spokesman and Iranian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
A source close to Lami confirmed his deployment to Egypt for training.
Supporters of the plan see it as a way of weakening militias that boast tens of thousands of fighters and who hold considerable sway over Iraq's security and economy.
They say it will hasten the fracturing of some groups belonging to the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), the state paramilitary umbrella organisation whose security branch Lami has directed for years.
The PMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
An Iraqi official, speaking on behalf of the government, declined to comment on Lami, but said there was a plan to restructure the PMF, including providing military training to its leaders.
Some critics, however, call it a risky gambit that puts someone with a questionable human rights record and who has been close to Iran at the heart of the Iraqi military.
They see it as another sign the prime minister is giving concessions even to some of the most hardline, Iran-aligned officials to secure support for his government.
""The plan is to bring onside PMF leaders who are not seen as totally loyal to Iran and to ready them through this military training for positions inside the military and security apparatus,"" said a security official.
""Lami will be given a senior position when training is completed,"" added the official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. He did not specify what post Lami would take up.
Egyptian military officials denied Lami was among a batch of Iraqi officers undergoing training in Egypt. But one Egyptian security source said he had been in Egypt in October, without elaborating.
U.S. SANCTIONS
Lami is the head of security for Iraq's state paramilitary grouping and a one-time member of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia. The source close to him denied he had any formal ties to Iran or the militias it supports.
He was put under U.S. sanctions in 2019 for his alleged role, first reported by Reuters, in ordering the use of lethal force against anti-government protesters. Lami has since denied any role in the killing of peaceful demonstrators.
The tenure of Kadhimi, who took office in May, has been marked by a face-off between his government and parts of the armed forces on one side, and Iran-aligned militias on the other.
The U.S. killing of Iranian military mastermind Qassem Soleimani and the Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike in Baghdad in January left the militias in disarray earlier this year.
Kadhimi has sided with the United States in efforts to weaken Iran-aligned Shi'ite Muslim groups that have grown to dominate Iraq's economy and state institutions since the U.S.-led overthrow of Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003.
The U.S. state department declined to comment for this article.
Kadhimi has made security sector reform a priority, focusing on a reshuffle of top state security posts.
Yet U.S. and Iraqi officials say the militias continue to harass the 3,000 or so remaining U.S. troops based in Iraq. Some lesser-known militia groups said they were behind rocket attacks on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
An Iraqi security official said recruiting Lami into the army was part of an attempt by Kadhimi to bring the PMF closer to his government.
The PMF nominally reports to the prime minister, but its most dominant factions are close to Iran - something Kadhimi is trying to change.
Sheikh Ali al-Asadi, an official in the Iran-aligned Nujaba militia group, said giving Lami full officer training was a sign of the PMF's strength, and not something that would weaken the paramilitaries.

""This is proof of the PMF's success - someone being taken from the PMF to work in the army shows how strong it's become,"" he told Reuters.

KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - Two judges in northern Nigeria on Thursday heard the first appeals against Islamic law blasphemy convictions that caused global outrage when a man was sentenced to death over a WhatsApp message and a 13-year-old received a 10-year jail term.
The judges, at the appeals section of the secular high court in the city of Kano, said verdicts would be delivered at a later date. 
In August, a Kano sharia court sentenced Yahaya Aminu Sharif to death for allegedly sharing a blasphemous message on WhatsApp and Omar Farouq, accused of making blasphemous comments in an argument, received a prison sentence. 
The convictions were condemned by rights groups, the United Nations and the head of Poland's Auschwitz Memorial who said he and others would volunteer to each serve a month of the boy's prison sentence. They also sparked a debate about sharia's compatibility with Nigeria's secular constitution. 
Nigeria is roughly evenly split between a predominantly Muslim north and mainly Christian south. Sharia, or Islamic religious law is applied in 12 of Nigeria's 36 states where sharia courts operate alongside secular ones. 
The charges prompted anger in Kano, the north's commercial hub, and protesters burned down Sharif's family home in March. 
Kola Alapinni, a defence lawyer representing the two defendants, said the convictions were incompatible with Nigeria's constitution, which gives people the right to have freedom of expression. 
""Where any law conflicts with the constitution that law must bow to the constitution,"" he told Reuters outside the court.

Both sides can take their case to the federal court of appeal if they are unhappy with the state appeal court's ruling.

Shapps also said that a total travel ban on Denmark, announced on Nov. 7 in response to concerns over outbreaks of coronavirus on Danish mink farms, would be lifted on Nov. 28. However, Denmark will remain on the quarantine list.
The minister said Bhutan, Timor-Leste, Mongolia, Aruba and several Pacific island nations had been added to the safe travel list, meaning that people arriving from those countries from Nov. 28 will no longer need to self-isolate.

A new quarantine regime is due to come into force on Dec. 15. From that date, people arriving from quarantine list countries will have to self-isolate for five days, at which point they will have the option to take a COVID test. If the result is negative, they will be released from self-isolation.

The EU parliament's resolution, which passed with 455 votes for, 145 against and 71 abstentions, comes after right-wing governments in Poland and Hungary vetoed the EU budget and a COVID-19 recovery fund this month, after countries sought to tie the funds to adherence to the rule of law. 
Since coming to power in 2015, Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has clashed with the European Union over judiciary reforms, which the bloc says violate democratic standards. PiS has rejected such accusations. 
Hundreds of thousands of Poles have taken to the street since an Oct. 22 Constitutional Tribunal ruling that sharply limited Poland's already restrictive abortion laws.
The protests have seen a broader outpouring of anger at Poland's nationalist rulers, with many criticising the judiciary reforms they say have allowed PiS to hand pick judges for its high courts to push through controversial decisions.
The motion from members of European Parliament ""underlines that the aforementioned ruling is yet another example of the political takeover of the judiciary and the systemic collapse of the rule of law in Poland."" 
The resolution also called for EU institutions to do more to support sexual and reproductive health rights across member states and to support grassroots and civil society groups that foster the rule of law.
Poland's government has not yet published the court ruling, meaning it is not yet enforceable. PiS says the government is waiting for the court to provide a more detailed justification.

On Wednesday, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro criticised European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's proposal that Hungary and Poland go to the European Court of Justice over the EU budget, instead of blocking it with a veto.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2020 11:42AM ET</span>","Ethiopia to launch 'final phase' of offensive in Tigray region, says PM","ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Ethiopian military will begin the ""final phase"" of an offensive in the northern Tigray region, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Thursday, after an ultimatum expired for Tigrayan forces to surrender.
The government had given the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) until Wednesday to lay down their arms or face an assault on Mekelle, the regional capital of 500,000 people. 
Rights groups have raised concerns for civilians caught up in military operations in which thousands are already believed to have died since fighting began on Nov. 4.
The United Nations estimates 1.1 million Ethiopians will need aid as a result of the conflict. It and other groups say they cannot enter Tigray to deliver aid, while refugees who have fled to Sudan are in urgent need of help.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach the TPLF for comment on Abiy's remarks. Claims by all sides have been impossible to verify because phone and internet connections to the region are down and access to the area is tightly controlled. 
""The 72-hour period granted to the criminal TPLF clique to surrender peacefully is now over and our law enforcement campaign has reached its final stage,"" Abiy tweeted, adding that civilians would be spared and thousands of fighters had already surrendered. The TPLF has denied its fighters are surrendering.
Both sides claim to have inflicted serious damage on the other, said Dino Mahtani, Deputy Director of the Africa Program at the International Crisis Group.
""But federal forces appear closer to Mekelle amid reports of heavy combat between the two sides yesterday,"" he said. 
Abiy's office said authorities were distributing aid in areas controlled by the federal government in Tigray. Four camps for displaced persons were being established.
A statement added: ""This humanitarian assistance will now be further reinforced with the opening of a humanitarian access route to be managed under the auspices of the Ministry of Peace.""
The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Ethiopia, Catherine Sozi, told Reuters she had no information on such an access route.
Nearly 43,000 Ethiopian refugees have fled to Sudan, but the numbers crossing have slowed from around 2,700 per day to just 700 on Wednesday.
According to two humanitarian sources, refugees arriving in recent days said many were now being held back at the border. Two diplomatic sources said it was not immediately clear who was responsible for blocking them.
""As far as we know, the border remains open,"" Sozi said.
Abiy says refugees are welcome to return. An aid worker at the Hamdayet crossing point in Sudan said Ethiopian soldiers could be seen on Wednesday ""screaming"" at refugees that it was safe to return.
Islamic Relief said refugees could run out of food within days.
""We are seeing many people with malnutrition, including pregnant women and malnourished new mothers who are trying to breastfeed their infants,"" said Elsadig Elnour, Islamic Relief’s Country Director in Sudan. 
Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for ending a long-running stand-off with Eritrea, called on the people of Mekelle to ""disarm, stay at home and stay away from military targets"".
A diplomatic source said the TPLF ""have mobilised lots of people in Mekelle. They are digging trenches and everyone has an AK47.""
Tigrayan forces have large stocks of military hardware and number up to 250,000 men, experts say.
African peace envoys sent to Ethiopia were expected to meet Abiy on Friday, two diplomatic sources said.
The conflict pits Ethiopia's federal government against the TPLF, which dominated the country until Abiy took power two years ago. 
Abiy accuses Tigrayan leaders of starting hostilities by attacking federal troops. The Tigrayans, who make up about 6% of Ethiopia's population, say his government has marginalised them. 
Thousands of people are already thought to have died and there has been widespread destruction from aerial bombardment and ground fighting. TPLF rockets have hit the capital of neighbouring Eritrea.

Daniel Bekele, head of the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, said ""extreme caution to avoid civilian harm is of even greater importance, now, at this stage of the conflict"".

GENEVA (Reuters) - Police and border guards must combat racial profiling and ensure that their use of ""big data"" collected via artificial intelligence does not reinforce biases against minorities, United Nations experts said on Thursday.
Companies that sell algorithmic profiling systems to public entities and private companies, often used in screening job applicants, must be regulated to prevent misuse of personal data that perpetuates prejudices, they said. 
""It's a rapidly developing technological means used by law enforcement to determine, using big data, who is likely to do what. And that's the danger of it,"" Verene Shepherd, a member of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, told Reuters.
""We've heard about companies using these algorithmic methods to discriminate on the basis of skin colour,"" she added, speaking from Jamaica. 
Shepherd, a historian, led the 18 independent experts in drafting a ""general recommendation"" to the 182 countries that have ratified a binding international treaty prohibiting racial discrimination.
Minorities and activists have complained about the growing use of artificial intelligence, facial recognition and other new technologies, she said. 
""It's widely used in the United States of America, and we've had complaints from black communities in the European Union as well. And Latin America where people of African descent and indigenous people complain about profiling,"" Shepherd said, citing Brazil and Colombia. ""These are the hotspots where we hear about cases of profiling being more prevalent."" 
Protests against racism and police brutality erupted across the United States following the death in May of George Floyd, an African-American who died afer a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. 
Many police use ""predictive"" profiling systems that lead to identity checks, traffic stops and searches, based on previous arrest data about a neighbourhood, Shepherd said.

The committee recommends that people who have been targeted deserve compensation, she said, adding: ""If they live to tell the tale, by the way, because we know sometimes it ends up badly.""

Frederiksen has faced opposition calls to resign and a vote of no confidence in parliament after an order by the government in early November, which it later admitted was illegal, to cull the country's entire mink population.
The order was given after authorities found COVID-19 outbreaks at hundreds of mink farms, including a new strain of the virus, suspected of being able to compromise the efficacy of vaccines. 
""We have two generations of really skilled mink farmers, father and son, who in a very, very short time have had their life's work shattered,"" Frederiksen told reporters after a meeting with a mink farmer and his son at their farm near Kolding in Western Denmark. 
""It has been emotional for them, and... Sorry. It has for me too,"" Frederiksen said with a wavering voice, pausing for breath in between words. 
The move to cull Denmark's entire mink population, one of the world's biggest and highly valued for the quality of its fur, has left the government reeling after it admitted it did not have the legal basis to order the culling of healthy mink. 
After a tumultuous couple of weeks since the order was given on Nov. 4, the Minister of Agriculture, Mogens Jensen, stepped down last week after an internal investigation revealed a flawed political process.
Denmark has proposed a ban on all mink breeding in the country until 2022. Tage Pedersen, head of the Danish mink breeders' association, said this month the industry, which employs around 6,000 people and exports fur pelts worth $800 million annually, is finished.

Denmark's opposition says the cull of healthy mink should not have been initiated before compensation plans were in place for the owners and workers at some 1,100 mink farms.

A process to fill the most important post in the field of international criminal justice has been deadlocked for several months. 
The five new names were added to an earlier shortlist of four. Some countries had complained that the original four, chosen through a process that emphasised consensus, did not include enough figures with the international profile required for the job.
The court's 123 member countries are due to meet in New York on Dec. 7 to 13, when they are meant to pick a successor for Gambia's Fatou Bensouda, whose term as chief prosecutor expires in June.
The position gained additional international attention this year when the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Bensouda, under a law normally used to target terrorists and drug dealers.
The Trump administration rejects the court and denounced Bensouda for looking into actions of American troops in Afghanistan. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to take a less confrontational stance, although Washington is unlikely to lift its objections to the Afghanistan investigation.
The new candidates include Britian's Karim Khan, who now heads a United Nations team investigating Islamic State crimes in Iraq, and Robert Petit, a former prosecutor at the Khmer Rouge tribunal in Cambodia. 
Notably absent is the candidate seen as having the highest profile, the prosecutor in charge of the U.N. war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, Belgian Serge Brammertz, who had previously expressed an interest.
Widening the pool of candidates could delay the elections because ICC member states may want more than the two remaining weeks before the New York meeting to make a choice.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson appointed Dan Rosenfield, a business consultant and former treasury official, as his new chief of staff on Thursday as he tries to restore trust in his leadership.
Johnson is reshaping his senior team of advisers following the departure of Dominic Cummings earlier this month. Cummings was seen as the driving force behind Johnson's strategy on Brexit and most other policies, and his exit has been billed as a chance for a 'reset' for the British leader.
Rosenfield joins from Hakluyt, a strategic advisory firm for businesses and investors, where he has been global head of corporate clients and head of the UK business since 2016, the government said.
He previously worked at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) as a managing director of investment banking, and spent over a decade working in the finance ministry where he served as a senior aide to former finance ministers Alistair Darling and George Osborne.
""Dan is a class act and an inspired appointment,"" said Rupert Harrison, a former aide to Osborne who now works for Blackrock (NYSE:BLK). He described Rosenfield as bright, tough and politically savvy.
Johnson has been heavily criticised for his response to the COVID-19 crisis and a failure to communicate properly with elected members of his ruling Conservative Party, which has stirred rebellion over lockdown rules and Brexit policies.
The decision to hire a relatively low profile former civil servant marks a change of direction for a prime minister whose inner circle was previously largely made up of alumni from the 2016 Brexit campaign, with Cummings at the fore.
The chief of staff is traditionally the most powerful political appointment in the prime minister's office. Though exact responsibilities vary according the leaders' preference, the job involves providing strategic and political advice to help the prime minister take decisions.
Rosenfield will begin work on Dec. 7 and officially take up the Chief of Staff role on Jan. 1, Downing Street said.

New infections have hit record levels in recent weeks after a lull in the summer, throwing the country's light-touch approach to fighting the pandemic into renewed focus.
In total, 6,622 people with COVID-19 have died in Sweden, a per capita total vastly higher than neighbours Norway, Denmark and Finland, which opted for stricter lockdowns during the spring, but lower than a handful of larger European nations.
Tougher restrictions in place since mid-October, however, may have helped slow the spread of the disease with the Public Health Agency saying infections could peak in the coming weeks.
""We are optimistic we can affect the development of the pandemic in this way,"" Health Agency head Johan Carlson told a news conference.
But he cautioned the modelled scenario by his agency was not a forecast and relied on the public following recommendations. ""If we don't get that as we expect, we won't have this development, we will have a worse development.""
The agency said the current pace of new cases was lower than that predicted by its model, but that this might reflect an inability of testing, which has been overwhelmed in some regions, to keep up with the spreading virus.
The government has given the agency the task of modelling how the pandemic will develop to help authorities and healthcare services with their planning.
The agency has faced criticism in Swedish media that its previous modelling attempts have been inaccurate, for instance in predicting during that the country would not face a broad second wave of infections during autumn.

The current scenario is based on infections reported between Aug. 24 and Nov. 6 and other variables. Sweden registered 5,841 new cases and 67 deaths on Thursday.

Lukashenko, who faces calls to step down following an Aug. 9 presidential election which protesters say was rigged, promised during talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 14 that he would reform Belarus's constitution. 
Lukashenko has denied electoral fraud and secured a lifeline $1.5 billion loan from Moscow, whose political support is vital for him to stay in power. He later said Belarus could hold new elections once the constitutional reforms had been adopted. 
But political opponents have dismissed Lukashenko's reform proposal as a stalling tactic, and the reforms have not materialised.
""As President Putin has repeatedly stressed, we are interested in seeing these initiatives happen,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Lukashenko during a trip to the Belarusian capital, Minsk. 
Lavrov did not say publicly what other initiatives Moscow may like to see. Russia has long sought closer integration with Belarus but Minsk has resisted, fearing it will be swallowed up by its larger neighbour, which dominated it in Soviet times. 
""We of course have an interest in the situation being calm, stable and we think that beginning the constitutional reform initiated by the country's leadership would contribute to this,"" Lavrov said. 
Lavrov told Lukashenko that Moscow was not in contact with the Belarusian opposition and accused the West, which has imposed sanctions on Minsk, for meddling in Belarus.

The incident was captured on closed circuit television and mobile phone footage which was circulating online.
""I have asked the head of the police force to provisionally suspend the police concerned,"" wrote Darmanin.
The alleged victim, who only gave his identity as Michel, told reporters on Thursday that he was jumped upon by police at his music studio in Paris' 17th arrondissement on Nov. 21. 
He said he had been walking around nearby without a facemask - against French COVID health protocols - and upon seeing a police car, went into his music studio to avoid getting a fine.
However, the police followed him inside the studio and started to physically attack him and racially abuse him, he said.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey does not expect ties with the United States to be strained under President-elect Joe Biden and does not anticipate sanctions over its purchase of Russia S-400 defence systems, a senior official in President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party said.
Relations have been tense between Ankara and Washington over issues from policy toward Syria to the U.S. refusal to extradite a cleric Turkey blames for a 2016 coup attempt. 
Turkey has relied on the good personal ties between Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump to smooth over divisions, but Biden is expected to be tougher on Turkey over foreign and defence policies and Ankara's human rights record.
Ankara's purchase last year of the S-400s, which are not compatible with NATO defences, raised the prospect of U.S. sanctions early next year if Congress approves a defence spending bill which the House of Representatives has already voted to include language requiring the president to sanction Turkey. 
In an interview with Reuters, AK Party Deputy Chairman Numan Kurtulmus played down that prospect.
""The U.S. President will most likely watch the balance in the Middle East very carefully for U.S. interests, and will not want to continue the tense ties with Turkey,"" Kurtulmus said.
""...I believe they will take positive steps in the future.""
PROMISED REFORMS
Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to the capabilities of its F-35 stealth fighter jets and has removed Turkey from the jet programme where it was a manufacturer and buyer. 
Ankara says the S-400s will not be integrated into NATO and has called for a joint working group to discuss U.S. concerns. Kurtulmus repeated that Turkey would not bow to pressure to return the Russian systems, or leave them unused.
""Sorry, but we didn't procure these to hide them. We got them to meet Turkey's security needs,"" he said.
While Erdogan has downplayed the possible fallout from these sanctions and vowed counter-sanctions, he has also promised economic and judicial reforms, following an overhaul of Turkey's economic leadership amid a plunge in the lira.
Asked if the reforms were aimed at easing tensions with the United States and the European Union, which will also evaluate possible sanctions against Ankara next month, Kurtulmus said the government would act only for Turkey's interest.

""We act by thinking about what reforms we need, what steps to democratization will benefit our people and move on that path, not by thinking what act or rhetoric would please them,"" he said.

SIRTE, Libya/TUNIS (Reuters) - In Libya's frontline city of Sirte, parts of which still lie in ruins, the commission set up to oversee warring rivals' recent ceasefire has put its name on a large downtown conference centre - an outward sign of its commitment to peace.
So far the ceasefire is holding, and some elements of the truce have been implemented: flights between rival cities Tripoli and Benghazi have resumed and foreign fighters have left oil facilities - the keys to Libya's economy.
But meetings of the Joint Military Commission in northern Libya, attended by five officers each from the two sides, have yet to make progress on other key demands of a U.N.-brokered agreement, underlining its fragility.
The rivals in a civil war that has left thousands dead and the country in chaos have yet to withdraw troops from frontline positions, open a major coastal road linking Sirte to Misrata and rid their ranks of foreign mercenaries.
""The danger won't end unless the process of national reconciliation is completed,"" said Mohammed Mofteh, 33, the head of a charity in Sirte, summing up widespread public scepticism about permanent peace.
Since the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) drove Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) back from the capital Tripoli in June, the shooting has given way to political jostling.
The U.N.-led diplomatic effort has set a roadmap to elections at the end of next year and implemented an audit of the central bank, which is split between the sides.
The 75 participants in a U.N.-led political dialogue, which is separate from the military commission's work, have also a Dec. 24, 2021 election date. But they have not agreed on a unified transitional government needed to oversee the vote.
Progress in those political talks slowed when they turned to the question of who would be on the new presidential council and the prime minister, said Hamad al-Bandaq, an eastern-based member of parliament who took part.
""We reached a stumbling block, which is the choice of who will be in the presidential council and government,"" he said.
Beyond the GNA and LNA's involvement in the peace process, their foreign backers - Turkey in the case of the GNA and Russia, the UAE and Egypt in the case of the LNA - also support it, though they, too, have invested heavily in the conflict.
Some of their military and economic interests could be lost or reversed under a new unified government.
FRONTLINES 
Situated near Libya's main oil terminals, and seen as the gateway to the OPEC producer's ""oil crescent"", Sirte - now under the control of the LNA - was a major prize in the civil war.
Its domed Ouagadougou Conference Centre, an undamaged part of which is now the Joint Military Commission headquarters, serves as a reminder of what is at stake.
The biggest building Muammar Gaddafi gave to his hometown, the centre hosted the 2009 African Union summit. But it is pitted with bullet and shrapnel marks from a battle in the 2011 uprising that toppled the former leader. 
After Islamic State seized Sirte in 2015, its black flag was painted onto the centre. Today a new banner for the commission hangs where GNA and LNA negotiators hash out details of their October ceasefire.
They have pledged to remove foreign mercenaries from Libya by late January, pull forces back from forward positions and open the road across frontlines. 
But U.N. acting Libya envoy Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) last week told the Security Council the GNA was still patrolling, the LNA setting up new fortifications and both sides landing cargo planes at bases they have used to resupply.
A Western diplomat focused on Libya said the two sides had asked for only limited outside monitoring of the ceasefire - a sign they may not plan new withdrawals until the political situation is clearer. 
In Sirte, queues of up to 50 cars at petrol stations point to the hardships of life near the frontline. Living conditions in Tripoli and the eastern centre of Benghazi this summer led to widespread protests. 
Williams has said this public frustration will aid the push for a deal. The U.N. process helped resolve an eight-month LNA blockade of oil exports which aggravated economic problems in both east and west.

The third strand of talks beyond the military commission and the political process is economic negotiations. There, too, the tussle, particularly over the National Oil Company and Central Bank of Libya, continues.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Cua Chiu-fai is on a mission to rid Hong Kong's classrooms of what he sees as poisonous anti-China bias. His soldiers: mainly parents. He has recruited hundreds of mothers and fathers to monitor and report on teachers deemed guilty of filling their students with hate for China and urging them to take to the streets in protest.
Using his YouTube channel, which has 114,000 subscribers, Cua says he has enlisted parents and other volunteers as part of an initiative called ""Help Our Next Generation."" In a video posted in late October, he talks about seeing pictures of ""people who looked like teachers"" directing young students to pick up bricks during the demonstrations that roiled Hong Kong last year. These teachers need to have their licenses revoked, he says in the video: ""If you're a teacher and you make your students destroy this place for certain so-called political positions, that's something we absolutely cannot accept.""
Cua's vigilante initiative has won the support of some pro-Beijing political figures in Hong Kong. Targeting the city's teachers has become part of a broader plan by China's leaders to reform the city's rebellious youth after last year's sometimes-violent pro-democracy demonstrations.
Some 40% of the 9,200 protesters arrested in the period between June last year and this year were students, according to figures provided to Reuters by the police. Of these, 1,635 were under the age of 18. About 100 teachers and staffers from primary and secondary schools were also arrested, according to the city's education secretary.
Alarmed that so many young Hong Kongers showed hostility to the ruling Communist Party and its vision for a resurgent China, the leadership has turned to re-education - a tried and tested tactic of the Party through decades of extinguishing domestic opposition. The aim is to remake Hong Kong's youth into citizens loyal to China.
Interviews with Hong Kong political figures, teachers and school principals, and mainland Chinese officials, as well as a review of new educational materials, reveal that the school curriculum, teaching staff, exams and extra-curricular activities are all in Beijing's crosshairs.
Lau Siu-kai, the vice president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, Beijing's top think tank on Hong Kong affairs, says the first order of business is to turn young Hong Kongers into law-abiding citizens, then instill them with national pride. ""Students should be told not to do anything detrimental to the safety and interests of the country,"" he said. Once that's been achieved, ""we want to cultivate a sense of patriotism.""
Two mainland Chinese officials told Reuters they expect there will be comprehensive education reform in Hong Kong within the current term of Chief Executive Carrie Lam, which ends in 2022. While they offered few specifics, the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that education reforms would include greater monitoring of teachers.
Responding to questions from Reuters, Hong Kong's Education Bureau said that ""fostering students' sense of national identity"" is a key learning goal, as it is in other countries. National education ""aims to enhance students' knowledge about our country's history, culture and development,"" the bureau said. ""As well as their awareness of the importance of national security, thereby developing in them a sense of belonging to the country.""
China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on the mainland and Liaison Office in the city did not respond to questions from Reuters.
FEARFUL TEACHERS
The education campaign is a crucial piece in a bigger project – nailing down political control of the former British colony. In recent months, China has imposed a draconian national security law that allows for the stationing of its feared state security agents in Hong Kong, arrested leading pro-democracy figures and delayed legislative council elections.
The government is painting a picture of a ""bankrupt"" education system to justify drastic changes and accelerate control, said Ip Kin-yuen, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents the education sector in the Legislative Council. The moves have engendered fear among teachers, Ip said.
In September, a Hong Kong teacher became the first to lose his teaching license after being accused of promoting the city's independence in class. Responding to the move, city leader Carrie Lam said ""bad apples"" needed to be removed from the education system.
Earlier this month, the Education Bureau revoked the license of a second teacher, saying in a statement that he distorted historical fact in class, including telling students that Britain ""launched the Opium War to eliminate opium in China.""
In the First Opium War, between 1839 and 1942, Britain took military action after China clamped down on the opium trade in the country, which was dominated by British merchants. The issue is particularly sensitive for Beijing, which views the conflict as the start of a ""century of humiliation,"" when foreign powers colonized and exploited the country.
Ip said in a statement that the teacher had made a mistake, but that the punishment was ""disproportionate."" The identities of the two teachers weren't disclosed.
""Teachers play a vital role in passing on knowledge and nurturing students' character,"" the Education Bureau, which oversees the city's education system, said in response to questions from Reuters. ""All actions are taken from a professional point of view to protect the interests of students and have nothing to do with politics.""
The increased scrutiny of teachers is having an effect. Michael Wong, honorary executive secretary of the Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools, told Reuters that following the imposition of the national security law in June, many principals have come to fear challenges from the government, parents or the public.
Fearing retribution, two teachers told Reuters they plan to steer clear of thorny issues like the mass detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang. When it comes to sensitive topics, they said, they plan to stick closely to newly revised textbooks for liberal studies, a civics course students take in their final years of schooling.
The revision, overseen by the city's education bureaucracy, was completed ahead of the new school year. A review of two of these textbooks shows there have been multiple changes. Expunged are sections that might be considered critical of Beijing, or supportive of democracy and civil rights.
* A section on civil disobedience, which referred to the 2014 pro-democracy protests that shut down major traffic arteries in Hong Kong, was deleted in its entirety. And the ""democratic camp"" is now called the ""non-establishment camp.""
* References to the Tiananmen student protests in 1989 that challenged the legitimacy of the Communist Party have been removed.
* Gone is a cartoon that raised questions about the election of Hong Kong's leader by a select few, not universal suffrage.
* A section on the rise of a local, Hong Kong identity and Beijing's meddling in the ""one-country, two-systems"" governing model that affords the city a high degree of autonomy has also been deleted.
The Education Bureau said the recent review of liberal studies textbooks was voluntary for publishers.
Karen Wong, who teaches liberal studies, says she consulted with her colleagues and they decided not to stray from the revised textbooks when teaching about the rule of law, China's political system and other potentially contentious issues. Until now, many teachers have used materials of their own design.
""Now we'll use textbooks more heavily because it's more safe,"" Wong told Reuters. She said it was unclear ""which terms or which words"" could spark a complaint to the authorities from parents or students.
The review, the Education Bureau said, was initiated because of ""mounting public concerns about the quality and accuracy"" of liberal studies textbooks.
Education Secretary Kevin Yeung announced a series of changes to the liberal studies program on Thursday. These will include cutting the course content in half and establishing a list of approved textbooks, Yeung said at a press conference according to remarks posted on the Hong Kong government website.
'MODEL ANSWERS'
The authorities are also scrutinizing exam questions.
Lau, from the think tank on Hong Kong, said exams need to reinforce content changes to the curriculum, with students being incentivized to give the right interpretations of topics such as China's constitution and Hong Kong's governing model. ""You provide the right sort of textbooks and then you provide model answers to the public examination questions,"" said Lau, who lives in Hong Kong. Students, he added, would then know ""which answers can gain scores in the examinations.""
For China's leaders, the youth-led protests in Hong Kong contained unnerving echoes of a perilous period for the Communist Party – the student-led Tiananmen protests that briefly shook their hold on power. After crushing the protests, the Party began in 1991 to introduce a patriotic education campaign on the mainland. The main thrust was to constantly remind students of China's ""century of humiliation,"" and the Communist Party's role in repelling foreign powers and restoring national sovereignty.
The project has been incredibly successful, says Zhao Suisheng, a professor at the University of Denver who has studied the education campaign. ""In China today, nationalistic sentiments are prevailing among the young people,"" Zhao said. ""That is the result of patriotic education. They gave them only the information they wanted them to have and tried to block all other information.""
Until now, engineering that type of groupthink in Hong Kong hasn't been easy. On a 2007 visit to the city, Chinese President Hu Jintao called for fostering a strong sense of national identity among young people. The local government opened the funding tap, allocating more money to national education.
However, there was no immediate payoff in patriotic sentiment. In 2012, tens of thousands of students, parents, and teachers protested the government's attempt to introduce a compulsory national education subject and the government backed down.
A Reuters analysis of government records on funding for national education shows it has continued to rise. In the 2018-19 school year, the government spent $15 million on student and teacher mainland exchange programs and $12 million in grants to 634 schools that have sister schools in the mainland.
But as the wave of protests last year showed, these efforts had little impact.
Implementing patriotic education in Hong Kong will be challenging because the Communist Party doesn't have the ""very well-orchestrated, structured and hierarchical system"" that exists on the mainland, said Zhao. If the people of Hong Kong have ""free access"" to outside information and continue to be aware of things like ""the international community's positions on Hong Kong,"" the authorities will struggle to reshape their thinking.
Already, there are signs of pushback. Ip, the pro-democracy lawmaker, is also the vice president of the 100,000-strong Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union, which has set up a legal fund to help teachers who have been targeted. They have taken on the cases of both teachers who had their licenses revoked.
""If one teacher can be punished in this way, all the other teachers will be afraid of being punished in the same way,"" he said. ""We want people to realize that we are still fighting, maybe in a different way, but the resistance is there.""
On the other side of the battle are pro-Beijing Hong Kongers like Cua, the education crusader. Cua, who teaches Chinese at an after-school tutoring center, said he launched his teacher-monitoring initiative to counter hatred of China and the Hong Kong police and government. Students, he said, need to be informed about the great progress China has made in recent decades. ""No matter how much you hate China, you have to first understand China,"" he said.
Cua says his group asks parents and students for evidence, such as worksheets, homework assignments and recordings, when they receive a complaint about a teacher. If a school is ""slow to act"" once it has been approached, then they submit a complaint to Hong Kong's Education Bureau.
Asked about the images of students picking up bricks that he referenced on his YouTube channel, Cua told Reuters they were from a video shared on a WhatsApp group during the protests last year. But he said he couldn't recall specifically where the events took place.
Cua, who has a sixth-grade son, said his group is now developing courses that it will offer to schools ""to strengthen national education and national identity.""
""In the past, what I worried about the most was whether he got good grades,"" Cua said of his son. ""Now, I only worry about his moral character, whether he understands what is right and wrong.""

The attacker, a 20-year-old born and raised in Vienna, was shot dead by police after firing on passers-by and bars on Nov. 2. Austria is investigating 21 people and has remanded 10 in custody on suspicion of being connected to the attack.
""The investigation's findings currently show that it cannot be ruled out that the perpetrator also wanted to deliberately seek out victims in churches,"" Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told a news conference. 
""There will therefore be a reinforced protection of church facilities as of today,"" he said, adding that the aim was to guard against copycat attacks in the ""sensitive phase"" following the Nov. 2 attack and in the run-up to Christmas.
Much about what happened before the attack, including how the gunman got to the scene of his rampage in the centre of the Austrian capital, remains unknown.

Austrian authorities have admitted ""intolerable mistakes"" were made in the handling of intelligence on the attacker, which included an attempt to buy ammunition in Slovakia and a meeting in Vienna with known foreign Islamists. They say he could have been considered a greater threat and monitored more closely.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>","France, EU lawmakers push for sanctions on Turkey next month","By Robin Emmott and John Irish
BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - France is leading a push for European Union sanctions on Turkey next month to follow through on a threat made by the bloc in October, but has yet to win support from EU governments beyond Greece and Cyprus, officials and diplomats said.
Paris says Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has not heeded EU leaders' warnings on Oct. 1 to back down in a dispute over gas exploration in the Mediterranean or face consequences.
The European Parliament on Thursday is expected to call for sanctions, decrying Erdogan's visit earlier this month to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north of the island of Cyprus.
""Turkey knows what it needs to do,"" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a French parliamentary hearing this week. ""Confrontation or collaboration, it's up to them."" 
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has criticised the EU for discussing sanctions, saying such debate was not helpful.
No detailed sanctions have been drawn up by France, but diplomats say any measures would hit areas of Turkey's economy aimed at limiting Turkish hydrocarbon exploration, likely in shipping, banking and energy.
Also at stake are a plan to broaden Turkey's trade preferences with the EU, its top trading partner, and its formal status a candidate to join the EU, which Austria says should end. Erdogan has called for a boycott of French goods, which one EU diplomat said did not bode well for deeper trade relations. 
""However, Turkey is a key partner in many areas, so there's no consensus in the Council (of EU governments). It is still too early,"" said another EU diplomat.
France is also at odds with Turkey over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Paris has accused Ankara of fuelling the crisis in the Caucusus, a charge it rejects.
Turkey, a member of NATO, has slid towards authoritarianism, undermining EU priorities in Syria and Libya, but remains a strategically located partner that the EU cannot ignore. 
Support for any sanctions lie with Germany, which holds the EU's six-month presidency. Berlin put its hopes in mediating between Greece and Turkey but was angered when Ankara, which withdrew an exploration vessel before EU leaders met in October, began exploring for gas off Cyprus again last month. 
""Erdogan really went too far with the Germans,"" a senior French official told Reuters. ""They didn't take at all well the new ship going back to the eastern Mediterranean just after the Oct. 1 summit."" 
A new spat between Germany and Turkey over the interception of a Turkish vessel in the Mediterranean this week has worsened already deteriorating EU-Turkey ties. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the boarding was an act of ""piracy"" and summoned EU, German and Italian envoys to protest, which Berlin said was unjustified.

""I think now there's a common understanding that there will be sanctions,"" said a senior EU diplomat. ""The question is what the market will bear.""

The French resolution adopted on Nov. 25 followed a Russia-brokered ceasefire ending weeks of fighting in the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, part of Azerbaijan mainly populated by ethnic Armenians. The ceasefire has been hailed as a victory in Azerbaijan, which recovered control of large swathes of territory held by Armenians since the early 1990s.
The Azeri parliament urged its government to review ties with Paris and to appeal to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to revoke France's role as a co-chair of the so-called Minsk Group, set up in 1992 to mediate the conflict. The United States and Russia are the other co-chairs.
The Azeri foreign ministry said the French senate resolution, which has no legal force, had tainted France's reputation as a fair mediator and cast doubt on its neutrality. It described the resolution as a provocation and said it was biased. 
France's foreign minister on Wednesday dismissed the senate resolution, saying it would contradict France's neutral position and pointing out that even Armenia itself had not recognised Nagorno-Karabakh.
France's population includes 400,000-600,000 people of Armenian origin. President Emmanuel Macron has been careful not to back a side in the conflict, but has faced criticism at home that he did not do enough to help Yerevan.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan praised the resolution, describing it as a vital first step towards recognising the right of the region's people to self-determination.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Taxi driver Lars-Goran Goransson admits to feeling a little anxious each time he slips on a pair of latex gloves and gingerly lifts a COVID-19 test administered just moments earlier from a doorstep in a Stockholm suburb.
""I think this is a safe way to work, but yes, I am nervous about the virus,"" said Goransson, 55, one of over 1,000 ""corona cabbies"" who now make a living ferrying COVID-19 swabs between homes and laboratory collection points in the Swedish capital.
Since the pandemic began, private hire taxi firms have home-delivered and collected more than a quarter of a million COVID-19 tests, an initiative that effectively puts cab drivers at the wheel of Stockholm's testing regime.
It has thrown struggling cabbies a financial lifeline during the pandemic, allowing drivers to stay afloat until the time when people, rather than swabs, become their main passengers once again. 
Under the initiative, run by the national health authority, cab drivers - many of them immigrants with a precarious foothold in the labour market - receive 320 crowns ($37) per hour, a bit more than a standard journey in central Stockholm.
Sweden, which bucked the international trend earlier this year of imposing a national lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus, was initially slow to roll out testing but ramped up its efforts over the summer.
Its coronavirus death toll to date is 6,555, a much higher per capita rate than in its Nordic neighbours though lower than in some larger European countries.
Goransson's daily work routine now includes kneeling on doormats to collect the packaged swabs and liberally dosing his palms with hand sanitizer.
Usually, people get their result within 24 hours of a visit from a ""corona cabby"", whom they may not even see as the pick-up aims to avoid close contact.
Goransson is proud to be assisting Sweden's pandemic fight, saying fast testing can help curb the virus, but he misses the human contact.
""Normally this is a very social job,"" he said wistfully. ""I've been driving a taxi for about 20 years and the best part of it is meeting people.""

PARIS (Reuters) - France has done a better job of flattening a second wave of COVID-19 infections that some of its European neighbours but it would be premature to talk about an end to the lockdown, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday.
Castex said the 'R' rate that measures the spread was now at 0.65 countrywide, the same level France reached at the end of a three-month confinement in the spring, but that citizens must not lower their guard over the festive holidays.
""Your efforts are paying dividend,"" Castex told a press conference. ""Pressure from the epidemic is weakening and it is weakening more in France than in other European nations.""
President Emmanuel Macron this week announced a phased unwinding of the lockdown, to begin on Saturday with the re-opening of non-essential shops and then theatres, museums and cinemas in mid-December.
Stores must restrict numbers to 1 client for every 8 square metres of shop floor, put in place one-way systems where possible and ventilate their premises, the government says.
Bars and restaurants will stay closed until Jan. 20.
The finance ministry said the expanded financial support for businesses would cost 3.5 billion euros in December.
Health Minister Olivier Veran warned the second wave was not over. A COVID-19 patient was admitted to intensive care every six minutes, he said, while France will not reduce the number of new infections to 5,000 per day until the end of the second week of December.
""The epidemic is not yet behind us,"" Veran told the press conference, reiterating that France could start rolling out COVID-19 vaccines by late December or early January.
A leading government adviser said mass inoculations would be needed for France to return to some sort of normality in the autumn of 2021 - something that might prove difficult in a country where scepticism about vaccines runs strong.
The government is under pressure from some economic sectors to accelerate the easing of restrictions, in particular from the hospitality and ski industries. Households are also feeling the pain.

French and German consumer confidence sank in November as coronavirus restrictions crushed any prospect of a quick reboot in the euro zone's two biggest economies.

MEGEVE, France (Reuters) - Megeve, in the foothills of Mont Blanc, was gearing up to welcome back skiers before Christmas after a COVID-19 lockdown was eased.
But France's government - while allowing cinemas, museums and theatres to reopen from Dec. 15 - says its ski slopes must stay off limits until 2021, leaving those who make their living in the Alpine village frustrated and, in some cases, perplexed.
""When you're outside, when you're doing sport outdoors, that's not the moment when you're going to give COVID to someone. COVID is passed on in enclosed places,"" said Pierre de Monvallier, director of ski school Oxygene, which operates in several resorts including Megeve.
Announcing a phased easing of the lockdown on Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron said it was ""impossible to envisage"" re-opening ski slopes for Christmas and New Year, and that he preferred instead to do so during January. 
""It felt like the door had been slammed in our face,"" said Catherine Jullien-Breches, the mayor of Megeve, whose currently green slopes are generally covered with snow by mid-December. 
""Unfortunately it's a real drama for the economies of the villages and the winter sports resorts.""
People who live within 20 km (12 miles) of France's Alpine resorts will able to visit from this weekend, but with the lifts staying shut, the main draw is missing.
""It's like going on holiday on the Cote d'Azur and being told the sea is off limits,"" said David Le Scouarnec, co-owner of Megeve's Café 2 la Poste.
The problem for the resorts - and the hotels, restaurants, and workers who depend on them for their livelihood - is that their season is short, and they will have little time after the New Year to claw back lost revenue.
Other European authorities are wrestling with the same problem. Italy's resorts regions are seeking approval for restricted skiing but Austria, whose biggest cluster of the first wave of the pandemic was at the ski resort of Ischgl - where thousands were infected - is sceptical.
Prevarication cuts little ice, however, with Mathieu Dechavanne, Chairman and CEO of Compagnie du Mont-Blanc, which operates cable cars at Megeve and other resorts.

He said who could not understand why the government allowed trains and metros to operate, but barred him from re-opening. ""It's like we're being punished. We don't deserve this. We're ready.""

Custom-built by Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital in a 16-metre (52.5-feet) semi-trailer truck, the mobile clinic will treat and rehabilitate native animals hurt and traumatised during wildlife crises across the country. 
Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital founder and CEO Dr. Stephen Van Mil said the project was conceived of two years ago, but the devastation of Australia's disastrous bushfire season last year underscored the need. 
""Seeing dozens of injured koalas sitting in laundry baskets waiting for care was heartbreaking,"" Van Mil said in a statement. 
Since then, a crowd-funding campaign, philanthropic donations, and help from conservation groups have turned the A$700,000 ($515,600) mobile hospital into a reality. 
The self-sufficient vehicle has been fitted with veterinary equipment, including ultrasound and X-ray machines, operating and recovery areas, water storage, satellite communications and solar power.
""Being able to work in a mobile hospital means that I can actually help these animals quickly. I can get there and I can give them the treatment that they need,"" said wildlife specialist Dr. Bree Talbot, who will be aboard the mobile clinic along with a small team of volunteers and veterinary staff.
""I can give them the medicine and the pain relief and the fluid therapy ... and get them back out hopefully sooner rather than later,"" she said. 
Ongoing costs of A$250,000 to maintain the clinic will be partly borne by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature Australia (WWF), said Darren Grover, the head of the WWF's Healthy Land and Seascapes group.

The request for the vote was made by a small political party, the African Transformation Movement (ATM), which has only two seats in the 400-member National Assembly, meaning it has little chance of succeeding.
""There had been a request by the ATM for a motion of no-confidence in the president that came through several months ago. The speaker has approved that request, and our recommendation is that it be dealt with next Thursday,"" the official told the National Assembly's programming committee.
A spokeswoman for the parliamentary caucus of the governing African National Congress (ANC) party, which Ramaphosa leads, declined to comment.
The ANC has 230 seats in the National Assembly.
Ramaphosa's predecessor as head of state, Jacob Zuma, survived many no-confidence votes before being ousted by Ramaphosa's allies in the ANC in February 2018.
According to the constitution, a motion of no confidence in the president needs to be supported by a simple majority or at least 201 lawmakers in the National Assembly to pass. 
The constitution also makes provision for the removal of a sitting president for serious violations of law, misconduct or an inability to perform the functions of the office, but this requires a two-thirds majority in the assembly.
The ATM's leader was not immediately available to say why the request for the no-confidence vote had been made.

The two largest opposition parties, the Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters, said they would respond later when asked whether they supported the ATM motion.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and China agreed on Thursday to prepare for a visit to South Korea by Chinese President Xi Jinping and to cooperate on stalled talks on North Korea's nuclear programme and on tackling the novel coronavirus.
China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, arrived in the South Korean capital late on Wednesday, after a two-day visit to Japan, as Asian governments prepare for change under a new U.S. administration.
""Both sides agreed to actively communicate so that the COVID-19 situation stabilises and conditions are created for President Xi's visit,"" the South Korean foreign ministry said in a statement after Wang held talks with South Korea's foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha.
China and U.S. ally South Korea have traditionally been suspicious of each other but in recent years they have found common ground in economic cooperation and a shared concern about North Korea's rush to develop nuclear weapons.
Xi was expected to visit South Korea early this year but the coronavirus epidemic put plans on hold.
Wang said his visit was to highlight the importance of efforts by the ""strategic partners"" to work to promote peace and stability. 
""The COVID-19 crisis could not defeat the citizens of our two countries,"" Wang, speaking through an interpreter, said as his meeting with Kang began.
""Bilateral ties are showing their strength and ever more vigour."" 
South Korea's President Moon Jae-in met Wang separately and they discussed peace on the peninsula, Moon's office said.
U.S. President Donald Trump raised hopes for progress in pressing North Korea to give up its weapons programmes in exchange for the lifting of sanctions but talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stalled.
Kang raised the issue of the incoming U.S. administration in her talks with Wang, who expressed ""hopes"" for its North Korea policy, a South Korean official who declined to be identified told reporters.
Wang reiterated China's opposition to a U.S. missile defence system installed in South Korea in 2017, the official said.

South Korea and the United States say the system is designed to counter North Korean missile threats but China fears it undercuts its security interests.

""I know people are frustrated, of course, it is frustrating living under restrictions, especially the last month has difficult for everybody,"" Sunak told the BBC.
""People will see a tangible change wherever they are compared to the last four weeks where people have been living with difficult restrictions."" 

The prime minister tested negative for COVID-19 and says he is as fit as butcher's dog.

More than 250 people were killed in the attempt to overthrow the government on July 15, 2016 when rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, helicopters and tanks and sought to take control of key state institutions. 
The state-owned Anadolu and other media said 25 F-16 pilots were given aggravated life sentences while four civilians were each given 79 life sentences. 
Former air force commander Akin Ozturk and others at the Akinci air base near Ankara were accused of directing the coup and bombing government buildings, including parliament, and attempting to kill President Tayyip Erdogan.
The trial was the most high profile of dozens of court cases targeting thousands of people accused of involvement in the coup attempt, which Ankara blamed on supporters of the U.S.-based Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen.
The 79-year-old cleric, who was once an ally of Erdogan and who denied any role in the coup, was one of six defendants being tried in absentia. A total of 475 people were on trial, 365 of them in custody.

CHENNAI, India (Reuters) - A severe cyclone slammed into India's southern coast early on Thursday, killing at least five people and uprooting trees and power lines. 
Cyclone Nivar made landfall near the city of Puducherry, located near the southern state of Tamil Nadu, with winds of up to 130 km per hour (81 miles per hour), according to the India Meteorological Department. 
Heavy rains from the storm caused flooding in some streets of the city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu's largest city which is home to many large automobile manufacturers, according to a Reuters witness.
The storm caused at least five deaths in and around Chennai from trees falling, drowning and electrocution, the Times of India reported.
A spokesman for the chief minister's office declined to comment on the reported deaths.
Local administration workers have been working to remove fallen trees and power lines, city corporation officials said on Twitter.
People in Velachery, a low-lying suburb of Chennai, said the storm's impact was mitigated by steps taken by the government ahead of the storm, compared to the hundreds of deaths during floods in 2015. 
""The situation was terrible here during the floods in 2015. This year, because of the precautions taken, the situation has not been that bad,"" said S. Sakthivel, a shopkeeper in Velachery.
More than a hundred cars were parked on the edge of a bridge in Velachery to keep them above the floodwaters, according to a Reuters witness. 
While rains are expected to subside in Tamil Nadu, heavy precipitation is expected in the Rayalaseema region of the neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh on Thursday.
The streets around the Lord Venkateshwara temple, one of the world's richest, in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh, were flooded and officials were working to drain the water, the New Indian Express newspaper reported.
Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Tamil Nadu ahead of the storm's landfall, a state minister said on Wednesday. 
The Meteorological Department said Nivar's intensity had dropped to 85 to 95 kph (53 to 59 mph) and is expected to weaken further.

An independent report published last week in redacted form said there was evidence that 39 unarmed Afghan prisoners and civilians were killed by 19 Australian soldiers.
None of the 19 soldiers was identified in the report, which was written by a state judge appointed by the inspector-general of defence. The 19 current and former soldiers have been referred for possible prosecution.
Amid the immediate fallout, the ABC said 10 soldiers had been formally notified that they would be dismissed. 
The broadcaster did not identify any of the 10 but said all of them were witnesses or accessories and therefore not among the 19 referred for possible criminal charges.
The Department of Defence did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The ABC said the 10 soldiers would have at least 14 days to respond to the termination notices. It did not say if any of them had legal representation.
Australia's most senior military official apologised to Afghanistan last week after the release of the report.

Australia sent troops to join U.S.-led forces that tried to defeat the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan in the years after the Islamists were forced from power in 2001.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government is to declare a climate emergency in a symbolic step to increase pressure for action to combat global warming.
The government will put forward a motion to declare the emergency next Wednesday, the government said as parliament reconvened after a general election won by Ardern's party.
""We’ve always considered climate change to be a huge threat to our region, and it is something we must take immediate action on,"" Ardern said, according to state broadcaster TVNZ.
""Unfortunately, we were unable to progress a motion around a climate emergency in parliament in the last term, but now we’re able to.""
Ardern returned to power last month delivering the biggest election victory for her centre-left Labour Party in half a century as voters rewarded her for a decisive response to the novel coronavirus.
The resounding win allows Ardern's party to govern alone although she has joined forces with the Green Party for the next three-year term.
The newly elected members of parliament were sworn in on Tuesday and resumed work on Wednesday in New Zealand's most diverse parliament ever. It has several people of colour, members of rainbow communities and a large number of women.
In her last term, Ardern's government passed a Zero Carbon Bill, which sets the framework for net zero emissions by 2050, with cross-party support in parliament.
If a climate emergency is passed, New Zealand would join countries like Canada, France and Britain that have taken the same course to focus efforts on tackling climate change. 

Last week, Japanese lawmakers declared a climate emergency and committed to a firm timetable for net-zero emissions.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Thursday sentenced the leader of an online sexual blackmail ring to 40 years in prison, the Yonhap news agency reported. 
Cho Ju-bin, 24, was found guilty of running an online network that blackmailed at least 74 women, including 16 teenagers, into what authorities called ""virtual enslavement"" by forcing them to send increasingly degrading and sometimes violent sexual imagery of themselves between May 2019 and February 2020. 
The Seoul Central District Court sentenced Cho for violating criminal and child protection laws by making and releasing pornography and running a criminal organisation, Yonhap said.
Cho's lawyer could not be reached for comment. However, when he was taken into police custody in March, Cho said he wanted to apologise to the victims.
""The defendant had lured and threatened multiple victims in various ways to produce pornography and distributed it for a long time to many,"" Yonhap reported, citing the unidentified judge who handed down the verdict and sentence. ""He in particular inflicted irrecoverable damage to many victims by publishing their identifies."" 
The case sparked a national outcry, with millions of Koreans signing petitions urging authorities to release Cho's identity and investigate not only the organisers, but also participants of the network who paid as much as 1.5 million won ($1,360) to see the abusive videos and images. 
Police have said at least 124 suspects have been arrested and 18 operators of chat rooms on Telegram and other social media, including Cho, were detained following investigations into similar sexual crimes since late last year.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico captured a gang leader accused of being the mastermind behind the massacre of nine women and children of U.S.-Mexican origin, authorities confirmed on Wednesday, a move that Washington hailed as a victory for bilateral cooperation.
Suspected drug cartel hitmen shot dead the three women and six children from families of Mormon origin in the northern Mexican border state of Sonora in broad daylight on Nov. 4, 2019, sparking outrage in Mexico and the United States.
On Monday, security forces detained Roberto Gonzalez, known as ""the 32,"" in the northern state of Chihuahua, along with two other alleged members of the criminal organization, ""La Linea,"" the federal attorney general's office said on Wednesday.
It accused Gonzalez of being the ""intellectual architect"" of the massacre.
""There's still so much to clarify about what happened, but at least these arrests are an advance in the case,"" said Adrian LeBaron, who lost a daughter and three grandchildren in the attack.
After the attack U.S. President Donald Trump called for the United States and Mexico to wage ""war"" on cartels and warn that he would designate them as terrorist groups. He later backed down from that threat.
The new arrests follow a period of heightened bilateral tension linked to the capture of Mexican former Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos in Los Angeles. 
The multi-year investigation and case against the four-star general was dropped last week in a bombshell decision that U.S. prosecutors said was necessary to assure bilateral security cooperation.
U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau congratulated Mexican security forces for the new arrests. ""Excellent cooperation between authorities in both countries. There will be justice!"" he wrote on Twitter.
Reuters reported last week that Mexico had committed to the arrest of a high-level cartel leader under a deal to drop U.S. the drug trafficking charges against Cienfuegos.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and the U.S. Department of Justice have denied a deal.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian court was due on Thursday to start the treason trial of more than 100 members and backers of the political opposition, in a case condemned by activists as a move by long-serving premier Hun Sen to crush his rivals.
A total of 121 defendants, all tied to the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), were summoned to appear on Thursday but many have fled into exile, convinced they would not get a fair hearing. 
""It will be a show case with a verdict already decided, not by the judges but by the regime,"" CNRP's former deputy leader Mu Sochua told Reuters, adding that only 50 defendants would appear. 
""More than 120 cases on the same date, the same time, by the same judges cannot be a fair trial,"" said Sochua, whose trial is at a later date. 
Defendants and court staff were seen arriving amid tight security, with most media unable to enter what police said was a packed courtroom. 
The CNRP was banned and its leader Kem Sokha arrested ahead of an election in 2018, allowing Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party to win every parliamentary seat.
Kem Sokha's treason charges stem from accusations he conspired with the United States to overthrow Hun Sen, which both he and Washington have rejected.
Other defendants believe they are being punished for advocating the return from exile of Sam Rainsy, Hun Sen's biggest rival during his 35-year rule.
""This is not a legitimate legal proceeding but a show trial, a political theatre,"" said defendant Seng Theary, an American-Cambodian lawyer who said she had seen no indictment.
""It's a Kangaroo Court employing laws of the jungle,"" she told Reuters by email.
The government says the treason case is legitimate. Justice ministry spokesman, Chin Malin (OTC:MLLNF), said the trial would proceed like any other. 
""The court will decide it according to matter of law and matter of fact,"" he said. 
The opposition crackdown has strained Cambodia's ties with the West and prompted the European Union, its key export destination, to rescind special trade privileges. Experts say that has only pushed Cambodia deeper into the orbit of China. 
The U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh last week said it was watching the trial closely and freedom of expression was ""vital in a genuine democracy"".
""We urge authorities to protect these freedoms,"" it said. ""And to take meaningful steps to reopen civic and political space.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Trump's pardon, which could be the first of several after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, drew condemnation from Democrats and other critics.
A retired Army general, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about interactions he had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States in the weeks leading up to Trump's inauguration in January 2017. 
He has since sought to withdraw the plea, arguing that prosecutors violated his rights and duped him into a plea agreement. His sentencing has been deferred several times.
""It is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!"" Trump wrote on Twitter, a day before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
Flynn's attorney, Sidney Powell, who told a court in September she personally asked Trump not to pardon her client, said the pardon was ""bittersweet"" because Flynn was innocent
Trump's move was the highest-profile pardon he has granted since he took office. Among others, the Republican president has pardoned Army personnel accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff and hardliner against illegal immigration.
""This pardon is undeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump’s rapidly diminishing legacy,"" House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it ""an act of grave corruption and a brazen abuse of power.""
MUELLER INVESTIGATION
Flynn served as Trump's first national security adviser but the president fired him after only 24 days for lying to Vice President Mike Pence as controversy broke over the former general's contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.
Flynn was one of several former Trump aides to plead guilty or be convicted at trial in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump’s candidacy. Russia denied meddling.
In May, Attorney General William Barr stunned many in the legal community by ordering prosecutors to have the case dropped, a decision that came after Trump repeatedly complained that Flynn was being treated unfairly.
Flynn and the Trump administration said U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who presided over the case, was required by law to grant the request for dismissal. An appeals court in August denied Flynn's request to order Sullivan to end the case.
""The President has pardoned General Flynn because he should never have been prosecuted,"" the White House said in a statement. ""In fact, the Department of Justice has firmly concluded that the charges against General Flynn should be dropped. This Full Pardon achieves that objective, finally bringing to an end the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man.""
The president has spent the days since the Nov. 3 election seeking to overturn the results and refusing to concede to Biden. On Monday, he allowed his administration to take part in a transition to a Biden White House, but he has continued to challenge the election's legitimacy. With less than two months before Inauguration Day, he could focus his remaining time in office on more pardons and other moves to burnish his legacy.
Two former White House officials said more pardons were likely. """"This is one unfettered presidential power the president enjoys using,"" one of them said.
'NOT LEARNED HIS LESSON' 
Trump said in March he was strongly considering a full pardon for Flynn. He said the FBI and Justice Department had ""destroyed"" Flynn's life and that of his family, and cited an unspecified, unsubstantiated report that they had lost records related to Flynn. 
Flynn was supposed to help cooperate with the government as part of his plea deal. But he later switched lawyers and tactics, arguing that prosecutors in the case had tricked him into lying about his December 2016 conversations with Kislyak.
The Justice Department has repeatedly denied allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and Sullivan rejected all of Flynn’s claims in December 2019.
Federal prosecutors had asked the judge in January to sentence Flynn to up to six months in prison, arguing in a court filing that ""the defendant has not learned his lesson. He has behaved as though the law does not apply to him, and as if there are no consequences for his actions."" 
Flynn also served as head of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency but was forced out in 2014 in part due to his management style and opinions on how to fight Islamist militancy.
He joined the Trump 2016 election campaign and at the Republican National Convention that year led supporters in chants of ""Lock her up,"" in reference to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Other former Trump aides were convicted of federal crimes following the Russia inquiry. Trump's longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone was sentenced on Feb. 20 to three years and four months in prison for obstruction of justice, witness tampering and lying to lawmakers investigating the Russian election interference. Trump commuted his sentence.

Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, was sentenced last year to 3-1/2 years in prison after being convicted of unlawful lobbying and witness tampering, which combined with a sentence in a related case equaled a term of more than seven years behind bars. Manafort was released from prison in May and is serving the rest of his sentence at home.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government civil servants could face mass firings under an October executive order before President Donald Trump leaves office and Democratic lawmakers, watchdog groups and unions are mobilizing to block the move. 
Leaders of 23 House committees and subcommittees asked the heads of 61 federal departments and agencies to provide a ""full accounting"" of any plans to reclassify federal workers under the Oct. 21 order, leaving them vulnerable to firing. 
They also asked for details about any Trump political appointees who have already been hired into career jobs or are being considered. Initial responses are due Dec. 9, followed by biweekly updates, according to the letter, spearheaded by Oversight and Reform Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney.
Wednesday's letter came after 13 House Democrats, including Gerry Connolly, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Government Operations and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, on Tuesday urged appropriators to reverse the order in their next spending bill.
Trump's order allows agencies to reclassify workers involved in policy-making to a new ""Schedule F"" category without the job protections they have now. The agencies must complete their reviews by Jan. 19, the day before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. 
The White House order says Trump is pushing to streamline the federal bureaucracy, increase accountability and make it easier to clear out ""poor performers."" The federal government employs about 2 million people in total.
Critics call the move part of an ongoing assault on government bureaucracy that has drained expertise and skills during the Trump administration.
Creating the new category of federal workers would expose the civil service to ""undue political influence and intimidation,"" the committee chairs warned in their letter.
In Tuesday's letter, Democrats said the order would ""expedite the hiring of political appointees into jobs without regard to merit and place them in roles best served by career civil servants — including economists, scientists, and data analysts."" 
House and Senate Democrats separately asked the nonpartisan congressional Government Accountability Office this week to monitor implementation of the order, warning it could result in ""a mass exodus"" of federal employees in coming weeks.
The White House Office of Management and Budget has requested to reclassify 88% of its workforce of 425 workers to the new category, Real Clear Politics reported this week.
OMB did not respond to repeated requests for information. 
The order has drawn fire from the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 700,000 federal and Washington, D.C. government workers, and the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal workers.
A spokeswoman for the Office of Personnel Management, which must sign off on the reclassifications, said the review period was still open. 
Biden has already pledged to rescind other executive orders targeting federal workers once he takes office.

But any move to root out Trump loyalists could run afoul of a ban on firing people for partisan affiliation - the one civil service protection the order left intact for Schedule F workers.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Argentina football legend Diego Maradona said his hero, late Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro - whom he considered a ""second father"" and whose face he had tattooed on his leg - once urged him to go into politics.
Maradona, who died on Wednesday aged 60, never fulfilled those aspirations but he did play a role in championing leftist leaders across Latin America - such as Castro, Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Bolivia's Evo Morales - and in helping to lend them broader international appeal. 
""Everything Fidel does, everything Chavez does for me is the best (that can be done),"" Maradona said on Chavez's weekly television show in 2007. 
""I hate everything that comes from the United States. I hate it with all my strength."" 
The son of a factory worker raised in a shantytown on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Maradona first met Castro in 1987, a year after helping Argentina win the World Cup and four years before the fall of the Soviet Union that would usher in a new era of economic hardship in communist Cuba.
An unlikely friendship between the often outlandish footballer and the well-read revolutionary deepened at the start of the century when Maradona spent four years in Havana to shake an addiction to drugs.
""Coming from such humble beginnings, Castro was his idol,"" said Alfredo Tedeschi, an Argentine TV producer now based in Belgium who became close friends with Maradona during a stint working for Reuters in Havana. 
""It was like he fell in love (with Castro), and then came Chavez, Morales and the rest,"" said Tedeschi, who would often invite the footballer over for traditional Argentine steak barbecue dinners. 
Tedeschi recalls the time Maradona knocked on his door and proposed a spontaneous visit to Castro. The Cuban leader received them within minutes of their arrival and cleared his busy agenda to spend three hours with them, including to play football in his office.
""They would always talk about politics - Diego was really interested in politics,"" said Tedeschi, adding that Castro would also pay spontaneous visits to his Havana home.
In 2005, Maradona interviewed Castro on his Argentine TV show, asking how George W. Bush had been re-elected president of the United States, to which Castro responded: ""Fraud. The terrorist mafia of Miami!""
As such, Maradona was also a propaganda tool for Latin America's leftist leaders, said Tedeschi.
""Diego was the kind of guy where anything he said would have a repercussion,"" said Tedeschi. ""And for Fidel, that kind of propaganda was welcome.""
In a twist of fate, Maradona died on the same date, Nov. 25, as his idol did four years ago - upon which occasion he said he ""wept uncontrollably.""
""These two dates are intertwined on Nov. 25, and will be throughout history: two greats, one of football and the other of the Cuban revolution,"" said pensioner Luis Perez, 64, in Havana. 
Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Twitter that Maradona's ""friendship with Cuba and especially with Fidel made him part of this people.""
Morales and Chavez' successor, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, also poured out condolences on Twitter. Maradona had voiced support for Maduro in the face of U.S. sanctions on his government. 
""With grief in my heart, I learned of the death of my brother, Diego Armando Maradona, a person who felt and fought for the poor, the best football player in the world,"" wrote Morales, an avid soccer fan. 
The former Bolivian president recruited Maradona to play against him in a charity match in La Paz in 2008 to show his backing for Bolivia's campaign against a FIFA ban on matches at high altitude. The ban was later overturned.
In an interview with Argentine newspaper Clarin in 2018, Maradona said he would consider going into politics, perhaps as running mate with Peronist Cristina Fernandez on the 2019 presidential ballot, in order to dislodge the then-conservative government. 
""Fidel told me I should dedicate myself to politics, and I would go with her, with Cristina,"" he said. ""I see people suffer, people who cannot make ends meet until the end of the month.""
Fernandez, now vice president, chose another path. But on Wednesday she paid tribute to her erstwhile admirer. 

""Much sadness, much. A great one has gone,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Until forever, Diego, we love you.""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered England into a month-long lockdown in early November after coronavirus cases and deaths started to rise again, angering businesses and some of his own political party over the economic consequences.
He set out new measures on Monday to replace the lockdown from Dec. 2, reinforcing a previous regional approach and warning that some areas would move into a higher alert level than the one they were in before.
Health secretary Matt Hancock will on Thursday tell parliament which of three tiers, ranging from the lowest at tier 1 to the highest at 3, each English local authority will fall under.
The government said allocations will be made using a decision-making process based on recommendations to ministers from regional and national public health experts.
Tier 3 means bars, cafes and restaurants must remain shut except for takeaway services, and that households cannot mix except in public places outdoors.
Tier 3 areas will be offered support from National Health Service Test and Trace and the armed forces to deliver a six-week rapid community testing programme, utilising lateral flow COVID-19 tests, which give results within an hour.
“I know for those of you faced with tier 3 restrictions this will be a particularly difficult time but I want to reassure you that we’ll be supporting your areas with mass community testing and extra funding,"" Hancock said.
Tiers will be reviewed on Dec. 16, making it possible for areas that slow the spread of the virus to be moved down a tier before Christmas.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has lobbied for London to be in tier 2, warning tier 3 would be ""catastrophic"" for the capital's hospitality industry.
Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was more likely than not that Greater Manchester would be returned to tier 3.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are under varying levels of restrictions, set by their devolved administrations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A United Nations Security Council sanctions committee is considering a U.S. proposal to streamline and lengthen exemptions from U.N. sanctions on North Korea for humanitarian aid groups working in the isolated Asian state.
The updates to an implementation assistance note - first issued in August 2018 - will be approved by the council's 15-member North Korea sanctions committee on Friday if there are no objections, diplomats said. The committee operates by consensus. 
North Korea has been subjected to U.N. Security Council sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The council has steadily strengthened sanctions in a bid to cut off funding for those programs.
""The U.S. proposal allows humanitarian organizations to fast-track exemption requests for urgent humanitarian assistance, such as aid to respond to pandemics or natural disasters,"" said a Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The diplomat said the measure also lengthens the exemption period and requires the committee to process urgent requests under an expedited timeline. 
While the U.N. sanctions are not intended to harm North Korean civilians, ""there can be little doubt, however, they have had negative effects, although this is difficult to disaggregate from other external and internal factors,"" U.N. sanctions monitors reported to the council in August. 
The coronavirus pandemic, a border closure with China and recent typhoons have added pressure to a North Korean economy already pummeled by international sanctions.
Last month, North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un made rare, tearful confessions in a speech at a military parade that he failed to tackle economic hardships.
An independent U.N. human rights investigator last month called for sanctions on North Korea to be eased because they may be worsening problems from the coronavirus lockdown. Russia and China had also suggested sanctions be eased for humanitarian purposes, but Western countries have said it was too early.

Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea’s demands for an end to sanctions.

(Reuters) - In the weeks since U.S. President Donald Trump lost the election, his lead lawyer Rudy Giuliani has repeatedly made baseless claims of widespread voter fraud and the campaign brought a flurry of lawsuits challenging the results, many of which were dismissed.
Representative Bill Pascrell, a Democrat, on Friday called for Giuliani and other members of the legal team to be stripped of their law licenses for bringing ""frivolous"" lawsuits and allegedly attempting to help Republican Trump steal the Nov. 3 vote from President-elect Joe Biden.
But legal ethics experts say attorney discipline is relatively rare, especially in politically charged disputes.
Here's why Trump's lawyers are very unlikely to face disbarment, suspension, or even lighter sanctions such as a fine.
BAN ON DECEITFUL CONDUCT
All 50 states and the District of Columbia have legal ethics rules for lawyers that are derived from standards published by the American Bar Association.
One ABA rule says that lawyers should only assert a claim in court if ""there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous.""
Separately, there are rules prohibiting lawyers from making false statements to third parties and engaging in deceitful conduct.
Judges can punish lawyers who violate ethics rules in a particular case by ordering them to pay the winning party's legal fees. 
Judges can also impose milder sanctions such as striking a misleading document from the court record.
These case-specific punishments are sometimes known as ""Rule 11 sanctions"" in federal court. 
Ethics rules are also enforced by regulatory bodies, typically ""grievance committees"" run by state judiciaries.
These bodies can suspend a lawyer or revoke his or her license.
'OFFICERS OF THE COURT'
Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and politician, made unsubstantiated claims in press conferences and media appearances about electoral fraud.
During a Nov. 17 court hearing, he initially told a judge in Pennsylvania that the election had been marred by fraud.
But under questioning by Judge Matthew Brann, Giuliani backed away from this unproven claim, acknowledging that ""this is not a fraud case.""
Other members of the Trump legal team have generally made narrower allegations in court, where they have presented technical arguments about why ballots should not be counted. 
Viviane Scott, a lawyer at Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz in New York, said there is a reason for this dissonance between what the campaign says in and out of courtrooms.
""We, as lawyers, are officers of the court,"" said Scott. ""We're under an obligation make statements that have a basis in truth.""
In one instance, a Trump lawyer has been accused of crossing the line.
Attorneys for the city of Detroit asked a judge to reprimand Trump's campaign for spreading ""disinformation"" by claiming in a court filing that Wayne County, Michigan officials ""declined to certify the results of the presidential election."" 
Republican officials initially refused to certify the results, but reversed themselves after a public outcry.
Lawyers for the city of Detroit asked a judge to strike the document in question from the record as a sanction. The judge has not yet ruled on the request. 
Mark ""Thor"" Hearne, the campaign lawyer who submitted the document, told Reuters the sanctions request was meritless and an attempt to score political points. 
MORE LEEWAY IN PRESS CONFERENCES
Rules governing attorney conduct apply both inside and out of the courtroom. 
""Lawyers definitely have a lot more leeway in press conferences, but they still cannot engage in deceit in their statements,"" said Keith Swisher, an ethics law professor at the University of Arizona.
On Twitter and in media appearances, Giuliani and attorney Sidney Powell appeared to have run afoul of rules barring them from making dishonest statements, said Brian Faughnan, a lawyer and ethics specialist in Tennessee.
The Trump campaign has since said that Powell is no longer representing it.
Faughnan said Giuliani acted unethically by tweeting on Nov. 22 that there were ""PHANTOM VOTERS"" in the Detroit area.
That tweet appeared to reference a sworn statement by a cybersecurity analyst, submitted in court, that had a major error: it confused data from Minnesota with data from Michigan.
Two days previously, the lawyer who filed the affidavit, Lin Wood, conceded that it was mistaken and needed to be corrected.
Giuliani either knew his tweet was false, or reasonably should have known it was false, Faughnan said.
""By the time he tweeted that, the screw-up had been publicly discussed,"" Faughnan said.
Faughnan said he had similar concerns about Powell's baseless claim at a Nov. 19 press conference that voter machines had been hacked and millions of votes switched.
Giuliani and Powell did not respond to requests for comment.
DISCIPLINE UNLIKELY
Despite these apparent ethical lapses, Faughnan said he did not expect state grievance committees to take action against Giuliani and Powell.
Faughnan said investigators have limited resources, and will focus on more straightforward violations such as lawyers who steal from clients. 
Faughnan said investigators would also be wary of disciplining lawyers when its about politics.
""When it is a very politically charged case, you know the first line of defense is going to be 'you are only doing this to us because of our politics,'"" said Faughnan.
Sanctions imposed by judges are more possible, Faughnan said, but still unlikely. Sanctions are typically requested by opposing counsel, who may decide the fight is not worth the time and energy, he said.

""Is a court going to take it upon itself to issue any sort of sanction in these circumstances? They might but it seems unlikely,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. federal prosecutors have charged a New Jersey woman with concealing multiple efforts to transfer money to Islamist militants in Syria connected to the Nusra Front, a onetime al Qaeda affiliate based in Syria's Idlib province.
Maria Bell, 53, of Hopatcong, New Jersey, was accused in a criminal complaint of knowingly concealing her involvement in providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely al-Nusra.
Bell appeared by video conference on Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Cathy Waldor in Newark, who declined to grant bail. 
During the hearing, federal prosecutor Dean Sovolos told the judge that when they searched Bell's residence, investigators found 136 pistols and rifles, 15 canisters of ammunition and an anti-tank rocket.
An affidavit signed by FBI agent Matthew Hohmann said that when offering the militant group assistance, Bell cited her own professional experience, including specialized firearms training she underwent while serving on active duty in the U.S. Army and the Army National Guard. 
Public defender Rahul Sharma, representing Bell, said the guns were ""antique weapons"" that belonged to Bell's late husband, and argued she should be released on bail because she was at risk for COVID-19 and posed little threat to the community. 
If convicted, Bell faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. 
The U.S. Attorney's office in Newark alleged in court filings that starting around February 2017, Bell used mobile phone apps to advise, and to facilitate money transfers to, al-Nusra, also known as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). 
The FBI affidavit alleged that Bell regularly used encrypted apps to communicate with a Nusra member with whom she had an online relationship. It said she allegedly exchanged ""thousands of encrypted communications"" with the alleged Nusra member.
The FBI said she planned to meet him in Turkey and sent at least 18 payments totaling $3,150 to his associates via wire transfer.

On Friday, a widely circulated video showed security guards at a Carrefour (PA:CARR) Brasil store in the city of Porto Alegre brutally beating João Alberto Silveira Freitas, following an argument between him and a store employee.
Silveira Freitas' death sparked a national conversation about race in Brazil, which often likes to think of itself as devoid of racism, despite vast inequalities between races in almost every aspect of life.
The store in Porto Alegre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul was overrun by protestors as was one location in Sao Paulo, while Carrefour Brasil's shares plunged. 
In addition to seeking damages, the lawsuit by the state public defender's office asked a court to shut the store in Porto Alegre ""with the objective of reducing the risk of possible hostile acts that could occur during protests.""
In a statement, Carrefour Brasil said it still had not been formally cited by the public defender's office, adding that it would provide any information needed by the government.

Among the other demands listed in the lawsuit is the creation of a plan to combat racism and discriminatory treatment by the retailer in Porto Alegre.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 03:37PM ET</span>",Special Report: To reopen or not to reopen - That is the fraught question for U.S. schools,"By Kristina Cooke, Benjamin Lesser and M.B. Pell
(Reuters) - After a two-week deluge of calls and messages from parents - and at least one death threat - the school board in Chandler, Arizona, called a special meeting this fall.
The board would revisit its decision, prompted by the coronavirus, to temporarily close local campuses and offer all classes online.
Parents, teachers and others poured out their thoughts in 1,100 public comments posted online before the September meeting. “If our schools do not open in person I will yank both my boys OUT and take them to another school district!!!” one parent wrote.
Many teachers assailed the district, which serves about 44,000 students near Phoenix, for wavering. “You look weak to the public; you look unconcerned for safety to your employees,” wrote one instructor. Ultimately, the board backtracked, voting 3-2 to start reopening school buildings. Eight-six percent of students returned to campus.
Across the United States, district leaders face pressure from all sides as they grapple with how to educate children during the pandemic, a Reuters survey of 217 districts showed. Many parents are balking at online instruction, seeing it as inferior to classroom learning and disruptive to life at home and work. Other parents worry about sending kids back into classrooms prematurely amid a raging pandemic.
At the same time, many teachers, some backed by powerful unions, say they are not comfortable teaching in person, fearing kids may infect them with a virus generally more dangerous for adults. Union leaders complain of inconsistent COVID-19 testing and safety standards.
Districts are caught in the middle, struggling to accommodate both families and faculty as they juggle the separate challenges of in-class and virtual instruction. Meanwhile, a new wave of infections has arrived, sending caseloads in parts of the United States soaring out of control.
“Every school district across the nation is in the position in which no matter what decision they make and how well thought out it is, it will leave some in the community thinking it’s the wrong decision,” said Larry Rother, senior executive director of pre-kindergarten through 12th grade educational services at Chandler.
Adding to the stress on everyone involved is unpredictability. Plans can change suddenly depending on the vicissitudes of the virus and officials’ tolerance for risk. New York City, with the largest school system in the country, epitomizes the problem. Six weeks after opening schools to optional in-person attendance, the mayor reversed course last week, closing campuses through at least Nov. 30. Parents and caregivers for more than 300,000 students had no choice but to adapt on the fly.
Reuters surveyed 217 districts in 30 states, which serve about 2.4 million students, to determine how jurisdictions large and small are coping with the question of reopening campuses. The broad survey began in late September, and Reuters conducted more detailed reporting through mid-November, focusing on 12 districts serving a combined 1 million students. The New York City school system did not respond to the survey.
Among the findings:
* The vast majority of the districts settled on offering a mix of in-person and remote learning this fall. Five percent said they were remote only and 5% in-person only. Some, like Chandler, changed plans after opening. The Jefferson County School District near Denver, for instance, is temporarily switching most students to all-remote learning this month amid the surge of cases in Colorado.
Most districts that provide in-person instruction require preventive measures such as masks and social distancing. Some have tried a little creativity: In Premont, Texas, a rural community about 70 miles southwest of Corpus Christi, administrators gave the youngest elementary school students Hula Hoops to help them keep their distance from others in hallways.
* Given the option, the districts said most parents want their kids to go back to campus at least part-time. About 70% of parents and guardians chose a learning model that includes some classroom instruction. Several district leaders told Reuters that virtual instruction has led to “learning loss”, or a regression in skills, among some students. But districts said they have to balance that concern against teachers’ desire for safety.
* Adapting to the pandemic has been costly. As of late September, the districts collectively had spent more than $340 million on COVID-related expenses including new laptops and internet hotspots for remote learners, as well as improved building ventilation and extra cleaning supplies for classrooms.
Some districts have been able to cover costs through the federal CARES Act, the initial relief package for COVID-19 passed in March, or supplemental state funding. But many have been forced to raid their regular budgets and reserves, creating the potential for cutbacks later affecting anything from textbook purchases to payroll. 
* About half the districts reported problems keeping their schools properly staffed, in part because teachers and other workers on campus must go into quarantine if potentially exposed to COVID-19. In Storm Lake Community School District in rural Iowa, Superintendent Stacey Cole recalled brainstorming in October with an elementary school principal who worried she lacked enough staff to get through the week. As of November 16, the staff was down about 10%, with five positive cases among adults and 30 in quarantine.
In a normal year, staffers report to work even when they have a cold, Cole said. “Now we say, ‘Don’t come in, get a COVID test,’” she said. But it takes as long as eight days to get back test results there, she said - sidelining those staffers in the meantime.
* Only about two-thirds of the 217 districts said they collect data on positive tests among students and staff. Most of those reported few or no COVID-19 cases during the first weeks of the school year. Since then, several, including the Dallas Independent School District, have reported surges, though the numbers there still account for less than 1% of students and employees overall.
The number of reported cases in Arizona’s Chandler district has remained low since students returned to campuses. Fewer than 1% of staff, and half a percent of students, tested positive as of mid-November.
In most instances, it is unclear whether cases originate in schools or somewhere else.
Most children infected with the coronavirus have mild or no symptoms, but kids can spread the virus to others, including adults and other family members, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
After members of her soccer team tested positive for coronavirus, 14-year-old Maddie Weiser of the Jefferson County district said she worried she might have passed on the virus unknowingly to others at school, or to her grandmother. “It's so hard for me to think about it. If this is this stressful for me, it must be 800 times worse for my teachers,” Weiser said.
A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one in four teachers and school staff has conditions putting them at heightened risk for serious illness from COVID-19, though the researchers said that is about the same percentage as in other workplaces.
""Where's the data that prove that we are not risking our health and safety or even our lives by coming to work every day?"" Mamie Huff, who has taught in Dallas elementary schools for 24 years, asked her district’s school board on Oct 22. ""This is heartbreaking. Because I love my students. I love my school. I love my job. But what I don't love is that I have no true control over my own health and safety.""
‘GREAT INTENTIONS’
Michael Hester, superintendent of the Batesville School District in rural Arkansas, captured the feelings of many school administrators during the fall term: “We count it as a blessing to even make it to Friday,” he said.
Hester said one of his greatest frustrations is the shifting rules coming down from the state. For instance, when the school year started in late August, the original plan was for the Arkansas Department of Health to conduct “contact tracing” on any positive coronavirus cases among students and staff on campuses. That means finding and notifying everyone who may have been exposed to the virus by an infected person. But within weeks of reopening, Hester said, that responsibility was largely shifted to the individual districts.
Dr. Joel Tumlison, who focuses on infectious disease outbreaks for the health department, acknowledged that officials had “some problems initially” doing timely contact tracing when schools reopened, requiring districts to assist with the work.
“It’s a big task, we recognize that,” Tumlison said.
Contact tracing is just one example of the challenges districts now confront that fall well outside the realm of traditional schooling. Others are enforcing mask and social distancing requirements and planning around the individual quarantine schedules of infected students and staff. 
In the Batesville district, which had about 3,400 students and a cumulative total of 95 cases among adults and kids as of mid-November, some families have had to keep students home for multiple 14-day quarantine periods, Hester said.
Then, in the case of virtual instruction, there is the dreaded problem of “learning loss.” When students in Dallas, Texas, returned to school in September, the district found through testing that there had been a significant deterioration in students’ math skills in the second half of the last school year when all kids were attending online.
“This concerns us significantly,” said Superintendent Michael Hinojosa, who also acknowledged some teachers were “scared to death” to return to campuses. “Math is sequential, you have to have (grasped) the prerequisites before you can learn the next skill.”
Maren Butcher, the mother of a high school sophomore and a third grader at Chandler in Arizona, said remote learning was a disaster for her children. “I watched the spark for school slowly die in my older son. We felt like we were picking him up with a spatula every day.”
After he went back in person, his motivation improved, the classes were more rigorous and he’s “been able to advance more academically,” she said.
In Texas’ rural Louise Independent School District, about a third of the roughly 500 students started the year with remote instruction.
Within weeks Garth Oliver, the district’s superintendent, started to see that students working remotely were struggling to keep up with their peers.
“You call the parents and they say, ‘They have been on the computer all day’ - but they are playing games,” Oliver said.
So on Sept. 22, Oliver sent a letter to district families announcing that the remote instruction would end the following week. “Everybody had great intentions but there is no substitute for face-to-face instruction with a professional educator,” Oliver said. 
Only two families left the district afterward, he said.
A JUGGLING ACT
For the nation’s districts and teachers, there is no common playbook.
Districts, for instance, have different thresholds for when to close campuses, based on COVID-19 testing results. In New York City, schools were closed because the city’s positivity rate hit a 3% seven-day average, a standard set by the mayor. Elsewhere, the thresholds are much higher. And some districts don’t have thresholds at all.
Randi Weingarten (NYSE:WRI), president of the American Federation of Teachers, a national union, said both educators and parents would be more open to having students return to campuses if the federal government provided a well-funded reopening strategy with clear measures of how it’s working.
“That’s the issue, instead of pitting teachers against parents,” said Weingarten, who top Democrats see as a candidate for secretary of education in President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration.
Meanwhile, teachers struggle to adapt to ever-evolving directives that vary by district.
In some places, instructors must handle both face-to-face and online instruction. Some teach the two groups concurrently - juggling, for instance, technology glitches with classroom misconduct. Other districts split up their staff, assigning them to virtual or in-class instruction.
""We've been pulling off the impossible, teaching virtual and in-person classes at the exact same time,"" Jennifer Lees, a teacher in Dallas, told her school district board on Oct. 22. ""We're exhausted, scared and stressed.""
Staffing shortages and budgetary constraints make matters worse.
After work dried up last spring, many substitute teachers opted to find other employment, said Katie Nash, president of the Chandler Education Association, the Phoenix-area teachers' union.
To cover COVID-related expenses, many districts received at least some federal CARES Act money, but the White House and congressional leaders have been unable to agree on a new relief package. And most states face budget deficits, limiting their ability to help.
Some districts also confront potentially costly lawsuits from parents of children with special needs, whose individualized education plans often weren’t designed for remote learning.
Another financial challenge comes when dissatisfied parents leave the district. State aid is often based, at least in part, on student attendance, so departures can decrease funding.
“A lot of these districts are hoping the federal government will come through at some point and make them whole,” said Dan Domenech, executive director of the AASA The School Superintendents Association. “If that doesn’t happen, a lot of school districts are going to be short.”
THE LOUDEST VOICES
Not all parents or teachers are of one mind about school reopening. But some voices are louder than others.
Even before the summer break began, the Chandler Education Association, the teachers' union near Phoenix, made its opposition to in-person instruction known to the district.
Nash, the union’s president, armed herself with survey data to show the district that more than half of teachers who responded felt unsafe returning to campuses.
She told Reuters that a small but highly vocal group of parents drowned out instructors’ concerns.
But Chandler parent Butcher, the daughter of a teacher, said she opposed what she saw as the union’s steady pressure on the district to stay remote.
“The loudest voice,” she said, “was not the parents.”
In Grantham, New Hampshire, about 30 parents attended a school board meeting in October to call for a full school campus reopening. The group clapped loudly when people made points in favor of reopening and was “somewhat disrespectful” in its behavior, said Superintendent Sydney Leggett.
She said parents who wanted to stick with strictly virtual or hybrid instruction were not as well-represented at the meeting, held in the school gym, because they were worried about contracting the coronavirus.
After seeing parents argue on social media, she sent a letter to families asking them to be kind to one another. The district decided to open for four days a week, in person, starting in November. It also will continue to offer a remote option. 

“I’m hoping when we come out of this we still have a good community feeling,” Leggett said. “It's going to be work to make sure that this divisiveness doesn't stick around.”

249,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 02:31PM ET</span>",African envoys head for Ethiopia where thousands of war dead reported,"ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - African Union envoys went to Ethiopia on Wednesday hours before an ultimatum was to expire for Tigrayan forces to surrender in a war that has shaken the northern region and killed thousands of its fighters according to one report. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government has set a 72-hour deadline for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) to lay down arms or face an assault on their highland capital Mekelle, home to half a million people. 
The deadline was due to run out on Wednesday evening.
Large numbers have died and there has been widespread destruction in aerial bombardments and ground fighting since the war began on Nov. 4. Some 42,000 refugees have fled over the border to Sudan and TPLF rockets have hit neighbouring Eritrea.
AMMA news agency, run by authorities in Amhara region who back Abiy, said that more than 10,000 Tigrayan ""junta forces"" had been ""destroyed"" with more than 15,000 small arms and heavy weapons seized in battles from Dansha to Adwa. 
There was no immediate response from the TPLF, Tigray's dominant political party which is spearheading the fighting. It too has spoken of killing large numbers of its enemies during a stream of often contradictory claims by both sides. 
With phone and internet connections to Tigray largely down and access to the area strictly controlled, Reuters could not verify the AMMA report - which quoted a military colonel but gave no evidence - or other statements from all sides.
A senior diplomat involved in the peace effort said he was surprised at the report of 10,000 Tigrayan casualties as it would imply pitched battles on a massive scale, and while that was not impossible he had seen no evidence.
Foreign concern was growing, he said, at indications of both ""clear ethnic violence"" and ""Eritrean involvement in some way,"" the diplomat told Reuters. Abiy, whose parents are from the larger Oromo and Amharic groups, has denied any ethnic overtones to his offensive, while Eritrea has rejected TPLF accusations that it sent troops over the border to back the federal push. 
FUEL LINES 
On the ground, long lines of cars formed at fuel stations in Mekelle, where there has been rationing, according to Nov. 23 satellite images provided to Reuters by Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR). 
Three African Union (AU) envoys - ex-presidents Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and Kgalema Motlanthe of South Africa - were due into Ethiopia's capital on Wednesday for meetings, diplomatic sources said. 
Abiy, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade standoff with Eritrea, has said he will receive them but not talk with TPLF heads until they are defeated or give up.
European nations discussed the conflict at a closed-doors meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, diplomats said. And U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's appointee as national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, urged dialogue.
""I'm deeply concerned about the risk of violence against civilians, including potential war crimes, in the fighting around Mekelle in Ethiopia,"" he tweeted.
The conflict is also roiling the wider east Africa region.
Tigrayan forces have fired rockets at the airport of Eritrea's capital Asmara, while Ethiopian soldiers have been pulled from peacekeeping missions in Somalia and South Sudan.
In Somalia, Ethiopia has disarmed several hundred Tigrayans in the AU peacekeeping force fighting al Qaeda-linked militants. Three soldiers of Tigrayan ethnicity were also sent home from a U.N. peacekeeping force in South Sudan.
The U.N. mission in South Sudan said it was aware of the soldiers' repatriation from the 2,000-strong Ethiopian contingent, noting that discrimination due to ethnicity could violate international law. 
Billene Seyoum, spokeswoman for the Ethiopian prime minister's office, told Reuters the situation in South Sudan would be the same as Somalia, meaning soldiers sent home were suspected of TPLF links.
'HARROWING' KILLINGS
Ethiopia's state-appointed human rights watchdog accused a Tigrayan youth group of killing about 600 civilians from other ethnic groups in a Nov. 9 attack on the town of Mai Kadra. The TPLF denies accusations of collusion, and accuses Abiy of persecuting Tigrayans in pursuit of personal power. 
Rights commission head Daniel Bekele, a former political prisoner, said the perpetrators, identified as ""Samri"" from their neighbourhood group, had scattered, including possibly to other nearby towns and among refugees in Sudan.
""It is a harrowing story,"" he told Reuters.
In Tigray, satellite images also showed Ethiopian troops in the ancient town of Axum and trenches dug across the local airport's runway. Axum's history and ruins give Ethiopia its claim to be one of the world’s oldest centres of Christianity. 
Abiy repeated his position on Wednesday that the Tigray fighting was an internal law enforcement matter.

""Because the Ethiopian government has painted this as a domestic, criminal situation, they are shunning the type of diplomacy and international mediation efforts that they are typically a part of themselves in offering to regional states,"" said Grant Harris, ex-senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council in Barack Obama's U.S. administration.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Biden urged to extend U.S.-Russia arms treaty for full 5 years without conditions,"By Jonathan Landay and Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Arms control advocates are urging Joe Biden to extend the last U.S.-Russian treaty limiting deployed strategic nuclear arms for five years, but some experts argue the U.S. president-elect should go for a shorter period to maintain leverage over Moscow. 
Upon taking office on Jan. 20, Biden faces an immediate decision on whether to extend the 2010 New START pact, which otherwise expires 16 days later, freeing Washington and Moscow to deploy unlimited numbers of strategic nuclear warheads and the missiles, submarines and bombers to deliver them.
""Just as dramatic action is needed to combat climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, immediate, smart and bold American leadership is required to reduce the threat of nuclear catastrophe,"" two dozen arms control, environmental and other groups wrote in a Nov. 19 letter to Biden's transition team reviewed by Reuters. To see the letter, click here https:// Many experts fear New START's demise could fuel a nuclear arms race and intensify U.S.-Russia tensions already at their worst since the Cold War ended in 1991, strained by Russia's annexation of Crimea, its alleged interference - which Moscow denies - in the 2016 U.S. election, and arms control disputes. The treaty's demise also would end on-site inspections that the world's two biggest nuclear powers conduct of each other's forces. That would cut off a critical source of intelligence used to detect cheating and to give insight into each other's arsenals to guide spending and force size planning. The Biden transition team declined to respond to a request for comment on the letter whose signatories include the Arms Control Association, the Sierra Club, the Council for a Livable World, and the United Methodist Church. New START, which entered into force in 2011, can be extended by mutual consent for up to five years. The arms control advocates called on Biden to quickly agree to an unconditional five-year extension.  Biden supports an extension as a ""foundation for new arms control arrangements,"" but has not said by how long. Speaking on condition of anonymity, sources close to his transition team said no decision has been made on the duration he will seek.  ""There's been a debate among some of the advisers about whether a five-year extension is the right move, or doing something shorter makes sense,"" said Jon Wolfsthal, former President Barack Obama's top arms control adviser. Those favoring extending the treaty to February 2026 argue that would put its expiration beyond Biden's four-year term, potentially reducing his leverage to secure a follow-on pact, said Wolfsthal, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. Russian President Vladimir Putin has long sought an unconditional five-year extension. ""Extending New START by five years provides the time necessary for the complex negotiations on a follow-on deal,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, who coordinated the letter. Victoria Nuland, the State Department's former top diplomat for Europe, wrote in Foreign Affairs this summer that Washington should seek a provisional extension of no more than two years and exact a price from Moscow. ""The one lesson Putin appears to have learned from the Cold War is that U.S. President Ronald Reagan successfully bankrupted the Soviet Union by forcing a nuclear arms race. Not wanting Russia to suffer the same fate, he is eager to extend ... New START,"" she wrote. Washington, she wrote, should use Putin's sense of urgency to tie New START to wider talks on all aspects of military power, including conventional, space and cyberspace. 
The arms control advocates argued that Biden's administration should announce it will seek a follow-on treaty lowering New START's limit of 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and restrictions on their delivery systems.

The United Nations said that since the outbreak of COVID-19, all types of violence against women and girls, particularly domestic violence, had intensified, with shelters at capacity and helplines in some places seeing a five-fold rise in calls.
""Men's violence against women is also a pandemic – one that pre-dates the virus and will outlive it. It too needs our global, coordinated response and enforceable protocols. It too affects vast populations of all ages,"" said UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in a statement.
Last year, 243 million women and girls experienced sexual or physical violence from their partner. This year, reports of increased domestic violence, cyberbullying, child marriages, sexual harassment and sexual violence have flooded in, she added.
In the Turkish city of Istanbul, several hundred people gathered to protest against domestic violence against women.
One woman taking part, who declined to give her name, said: ""The law does not protect women as it should. We are here to make our voice heard. There are femicides happening almost every day in this country but people who are committing the crime are walking free.""
In Italy, protesters gathered outside parliament bearing banners reading ""If they touch one (of us), they touch all"" and ""Women are not toys"".
Italy went through one of the world's strictest lockdowns between March and May and last month introduced new restrictions.
Its quarantine is creating conditions for increased murders of women by family members in the same home, according to a study by the Italian Economic and Social Research Institute.
""We have witnessed an increase in domestic violence during confinement measures,"" said protester Serena Freddi. ""This shows the home is still a place of conflict and violence for women."" 
Spain held a minute's silence for murdered women on Wednesday and in Portugal, the OMA observatory, which monitors femicide, said so far in 2020 30 women had been murdered, half of them victims of domestic violence.
The country's Interior Minister Eduardo Cabrita said there was a 6% drop in the number of complaints about violence in the first 10 months of 2020 from a year ago, which he said was a worrying sign that women were struggled to access help during lockdown.
The government launched a video campaign called #ISurvived, which warns of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and hopes to spread the word about support available to victims of domestic violence.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in her weekly podcast, ""statistically, every 45 minutes a woman in our country is attacked by her current or former partner. These are the cruel facts. Every single case tells a horrible story...We must never look the other way when girls or women are threatened with violence or attacked.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The 29-country anti-drug trafficking Orion Campaign seized more than 90 tonnes of cocaine over about six weeks earlier this year, Colombian President Ivan Duque said on Wednesday.
The sixth phase of the campaign, which began in 2018, took place between Sept. 15 and Oct. 30. The cocaine confiscation is equivalent to about 250 million doses, Duque said.
""90.7 tonnes of cocaine were seized in the sixth phase of Orion. This multinational operation saves lives,"" Duque said in a virtual presentation.
More than 18 tonnes of marijuana were also confiscated and 413 people of various nationalities arrested. Seven airplanes, 76 boats and five semi-submersible watercraft were impounded.
The government of the Andean country is under constant pressure from the United States to reduce cultivation of coca, the base ingredient in cocaine. It said earlier this week it would meet its eradication target for 2020, increasing removals by 30% year-on-year to record levels.
Countries participating in Orion have overall seized more than 284 tonnes of cocaine and 63 tonnes of marijuana since the operation began.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Four jailed Saudi women's rights activists were given a rare appearance in court on Wednesday, the family of one of them said, as the kingdom's human rights record faces new scrutiny following the election defeat of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Loujain al-Hathloul, 31, looked weak, her body shaking uncontrollably and her voice faint, her sister Lina told Reuters, adding that her parents had sat next to her in court. It was her first appearance since March last year.
The judge announced he was transferring the case from regular criminal court to a terrorism court, Lina al-Hathloul said. Human Rights Watch denounced that decision as an attempt to escalate the case.
Another sister, Alia al-Hathloul, tweeted that three other prominent women's rights activists - Nassima Al-Sadah, Samar Badawi and Nouf Abdelaziz - had also appeared. Further details about their appearances were not immediately available.
The Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The four women were among more than a dozen activists rounded up in 2018, the year Saudi Arabia lifted a long-standing ban on women driving but accompanied that move with a crackdown on activists who had campaigned against the ban.
Officials have said the arrests of women activists were made on suspicion of harming Saudi interests and offering support to hostile elements abroad. Few charges have been made public, but those against Hathloul include communicating with foreign journalists, attempting to apply for a job at the United Nations and attending digital privacy training, her family has said.
Rights groups say at least three of the women, including Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement for months and subjected to abuse including electric shocks, flogging and sexual assault. Saudi officials have denied torture allegations.
Hathloul went on hunger strike last month to protest against the conditions of her detention. Her family said she was forced to abandon the hunger strike after two weeks because her jailers were waking her every two hours. 
""How credible is it that after more than a year of being judged in the criminal court, the judge now says he has a lack of jurisdiction and transferred her to the terrorism court?"" sister Lina al-Hathloul told Reuters.
Adam Coogle, Deputy Director of the Middle East and North Africa Division at Human Rights Watch, called the transfer of the case to terrorism court ""yet another effort to stigmatize Hathloul and her activities, but no one should be fooled about what this case is really about.""
SCRUTINY AFTER TRUMP
Saudi Arabia faces greater scrutiny over its human rights record following the Nov. 3 election defeat of Trump, a strong supporter of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
President-elect Joe Biden has described Saudi Arabia as a ""pariah"" for its human rights record and said he will take a firmer line. Last week, the kingdom hosted a virtual G20 leaders summit, one of Trump's final appearances in world diplomacy.
Dozens of western lawmakers, leading human rights groups and jailed activists' families condemned the summit.
In a letter to the Saudi ambassador to Washington on Tuesday, a bipartisan group of senators called on Saudi Arabia to release the women's rights activists.
Under the crown prince, Riyadh has enacted reforms of strict social codes, chipping away at a system of ""guardianship"" that requires women to obtain a male relative's permission to travel abroad, work outside the home or take important decisions.
Social reforms have been accompanied by a hard line on political dissent, and the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khasshoggi in the Saudi diplomatic mission in Istanbul wrecked Prince Mohammed's international reputation.

In an interview earlier this month, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Britain raised the prospect of clemency for jailed women activists. Asked by Reuters on Saturday whether Saudi Arabia was considering clemency, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said this was a ""non-issue"" as the women were still on trial.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran has exchanged a jailed British-Australian academic, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, with three Iranians who had been detained abroad, Iran's state broadcaster IRIB reported on Wednesday.
Moore-Gilbert, a specialist in Middle East politics at the University of Melbourne, was detained in Iran in September, 2018 and had been serving a 10-year sentence for espionage. 
State TV said that an Iranian businessman and two Iranian citizens who had been held abroad ""on baseless charges"" had been exchanged for Moore-Gilbert. 
It gave no further details about the three Iranians, but said they were detained for trying to circumvent U.S. sanctions, reimposed on Iran in 2018 when Washington exited Iran's nuclear deal with six powers. 
Footage aired by state TV showed Moore-Gilbert at the airport with a headscarf, appearing to be waiting to board a plane to leave Iran. 
The footage also showed three men wearing face-masks with Iranian national flags on their shoulders and one in a wheelchair with his both legs amputated at the knee, were welcomed at the airport by Iranian officials with chants of “Allahu akbar” (God is Greatest).
There was no immediate comment from Britain's Foreign Office. 
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals in recent years, mostly on espionage charges.
Rights activists have accused Iran of arresting dual nationals to try to win concessions from other countries. Tehran denies it holds people for political reasons and has accused many of the foreigners in its jails of espionage.

Speaking shortly after China's President Xi Jinping congratulated Biden for his victory, Lopez Obrador reiterated that it would be wrong to offer congratulations until the electoral process has been formally concluded.
""We do not agree with offering congratulations in advance,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters at a regular government news conference. ""What's the best thing? For us to wait.""
U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has launched legal challenges in an effort to overturn the election result, accusing Biden's Democrats of trying to steal the election. However, without conceding defeat, he has now signaled that transition to a Biden administration can proceed. 
Lopez Obrador, who has repeatedly accused opponents of electoral fraud over the years, again referred to the 2006 Mexican presidential election by way of justifying his stance.
Lopez Obrador insists he was robbed in 2006. His use of that example in defending his stance on Biden has upset some U.S. officials, who regard the comparison as inappropriate.
The Mexican president said he had nothing against any candidate or political party in the U.S. electoral process.
Privately, Mexican officials say he is wary of antagonizing Trump, who during his presidency threatened to hurt Mexico economically if it did not curb illegal immigration.
The Mexican president said some in his security cabinet suggested in a meeting on Tuesday that it was time to recognize Biden.
A number of U.S. Democrats have expressed frustration with Lopez Obrador's reluctance to recognize Biden, and one former official of the last Democratic administration said the Mexican president's stance was starting to look ""foolish.""
""The world is moving on,"" said the ex-official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noting that other countries were moving ahead with their business with the incoming Biden administration.

""Mexico is getting left behind,"" said the former official. ""But that's Mexico's fault.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Trump administration plans to tighten sanctions on Tehran during its final months in power, the top U.S. envoy on Iran said on Wednesday, as he urged President-elect Joe Biden to use the leverage to press for a deal that reduces the regional and nuclear threats posed by the Islamic Republic.
U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Elliott Abrams, praising Biden's National Security Adviser and nominee for Secretary of State as ""terrific people"", cautioned against repeating what he saw as former President Barack Obama's mistakes in negotiating the 2015 nuclear deal. President Donald Trump left that deal unilaterally two years ago.
Biden, set to take office on Jan. 20, has said he will return the United States to the Obama-era deal if Iran resumes compliance.
Abrams, at a virtual Beirut Institute event, said the Trump administration plans further pressure on Tehran, with sanctions related to arms, weapons of mass destruction and human rights.
""We will have next week, and the week after, and the week after - all through December and January, there will be sanctions that deal with arms, that deal with weapons of mass destruction, that deal with human rights. ... So this will continue on for another couple of months, right until the end,"" Abrams said.
Abrams said he expects a negotiation to take place with Iran next year and that he believes a deal will be struck under the Biden administration.
""We think the Biden administration has a great opportunity because there is so much leverage on Iran through the sanctions,"" Abrams said, adding he sees an opportunity to work with France, Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as allies in the region, to strike a deal that addresses both missile and regional threats from Iran.
""If we discard the leverage we have, it would really be tragic and foolish. But if we use it there is a chance I think for constructive agreement that addresses all of these problems,"" he added.
He said it would be wrong to assume the new administration could reverse Iran policy like switching a light, and said negotiations would take many months.
Iran's clerical rulers have ruled out negotiations over its missile program or changing its regional policy. Instead it wants a change in U.S. policy, including the lifting of sanctions.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen since Trump abandoned Obama's 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and restored harsh economic sanctions to pressure Tehran to negotiate deeper curbs on its nuclear program, ballistic missile development and support for regional proxy forces.

Abrams on Wednesday announced Iran-related sanctions on four entities in China and Russia, accusing them of activities promoting Iran's missile program.

Sino-U.S. relations have deteriorated to their worst in decades during incumbent U.S. President's Donald Trump's four years in office, with disputes simmering over issues from trade and technology to Hong Kong and the coronavirus.
In his congratulatory message to Biden, Xi said healthy ties between the world's two biggest economies were not only in the fundamental interests of their two peoples but also expected by the international community, Xinhua reported.
Asked to comment, an official of Biden's transition team said: ""We appreciate the congratulations from all world leaders who have conveyed them, including President Xi.""
During the election campaign, Biden vowed a tough line on China's expanding influence worldwide and referred to Xi more than once as a ""thug"" for his human rights practices. 
On Tuesday, in formally unveiling his foreign policy team, Biden said allies were looking forward to the United States reasserting its historic role as a global leader in the Pacific, where China has been seeking to supplant it as the dominant power.
At the same time, Biden, who is due to take office on Jan. 20, has prioritized progress on issues such as climate change, nuclear nonproliferation and global health, for which he will need Chinese cooperation. 
China's foreign ministry congratulated Biden on Nov. 13, nearly a week after many U.S. allies had, holding out as Trump, who is still challenging the election results, refused to concede defeat.
In 2016, Xi sent congratulations to Trump on Nov. 9, a day after that year's election.

Also on Wednesday, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan congratulated Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, on being elected as the next U.S. vice president, Xinhua said, without providing further details.

Alejandro Encinas, deputy interior minister responsible for human rights, said there had been 138 homicides of journalists since 2010, 38 of them since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office on Dec. 1, 2018.
""Over the last three years they have rebounded significantly, and this year unfortunately is the year in which the highest number of homicides have been committed in the last decade, reaching 19,"" Encinas told a regular news conference.
According to the Committee for Protection of Journalists (CPJ), an advocacy group, media professionals are often targeted when their work upsets criminal gangs or corrupt officials.
The 2020 murder total was considerably higher than figures registered by advocacy groups. It followed 17 such homicides last year, Encinas said.
Mexico is often ranked one of most dangerous countries for journalists to work in, and Lopez Obrador took power vowing to bring down violence and step up protections for media workers. 
However, murders of journalists have risen in tandem with record levels of homicides in Mexico as a whole, much of it fueled by rampant violence among feuding drug cartels.
The most dangerous states for journalists since Lopez Obrador took office have been Sonora, Guerrero, Veracruz and Michoacan, according to the government's figures.

The failure of authorities to punish perpetrators of murders is regularly cited as a factor behind the violence, and Encinas said only 5% of the murders against journalists committed under the current administration had led to criminal sentencing.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's parliament will on Thursday decide whether to approve the government's 2021 budget, in a vote that could decide Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's political future as the country grapples with a coronavirus-induced health and economic crisis.
Muhyiddin has held a two-seat parliamentary majority since taking power in March, but a recent leadership challenge by opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim and deepening rifts in his coalition have raised the stakes ahead of the crucial vote.
Losing the budget would be as good as a no-confidence vote, analysts have said, and could trigger an election at a time when Malaysia faces a fresh spike in coronavirus cases amid efforts to recover from its first economic contraction in over a decade.
Malaysia's saw its cumulative cases rise by over four-fold since September to nearly 60,000 on Wednesday, in the aftermath of an election in Sabah state in Borneo.
Muhyiddin had called for cross-party support for his government's budget, the largest in the country's history, to boost economic recovery through higher development spending and with cash aid and subsidies for people and businesses hit hard by the pandemic.
On Tuesday, 20 members of the executive from his ruling coalition's largest bloc, which is led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) former ruling party, pledged support for Muhyiddin and his budget.
But the premier faces dissent in UMNO, whose backing remains tenuous after former leader and Prime Minister Najib Razak attempted to broker conditional support for Anwar from among the party's lawmakers.

""Nothing is certain at this stage. The fact that members of the administration had to declare their support suggests that not all of the backbenchers are for the budget,"" said Adib Zalkapli, Malaysia director with political risk consultancy BowerGroupAsia.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - An explosion damaged a Greek-managed tanker at a Saudi Arabian terminal on the Red Sea just north of the Yemeni border, the ship's manager said on Wednesday, in an attack confirmed by Saudi Arabia. 
In a statement published by state media, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen said a commercial vessel suffered minor damage from shrapnel in what it described as a foiled terrorist attack. 
British maritime security company Ambrey said earlier that the Maltese-flagged tanker Agrari, managed by TMS Tankers, was damaged by a mine while berthed at the al-Shuqaiq Steam Power Plant (SSPP). 
""The explosion took place in port limits and punctured the hull of the vessel, which is in ballast,"" Ambrey said in a statement. It did not say when the incident happened but noted the vessel had arrived at al-Shuqaiq on Nov. 23.
A TMS company source told Reuters: ""I can't confirm what exactly the cause was. It is possible [that it was from a mine], certainly it was a blast. We have nobody injured, there is no spill or pollution. The ship is in good condition, everyone is ok.""
The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) separately said it was aware a vessel had experienced an explosion at Shuqaiq in Saudi Arabia while operating at an oil-fired power plant there. It said investigations were ongoing. 
The Agrari is an aframax crude oil tanker, data on TMS Tankers website showed.
The blast follows a number of recent security incidents concerning Saudi oil infrastructure. 
Yemen's Houthi group on Monday claimed a strike on a  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) petroleum products distribution plant in Jeddah. Aramco and Saudi authorities confirmed the attack. 
Two weeks ago, a fire near a floating platform belonging to the Jazan oil products terminal was contained with no injuries.
That fire was the result of another attempted Houthi attack, in which the Saudi-led coalition intercepted and destroyed two explosive-laden boats in the southern Red Sea. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the Houthis regarding the latest incident. 
Houthi leader Muhammed Ali Houthi did not explicitly deny the attack, but said in a tweet that any military or security operations are announced through military and security establishments officially. 
On Tuesday the coalition said it had destroyed five Houthi-laid mines in the Red Sea.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The majority of migrant Venezuelan women living in Colombia work informally in unstable jobs which risk their fundamental rights such as access to healthcare, education and housing, a report by academics and humanitarians said on Wednesday. 
More than 90% of Venezuelan women in Colombia work long hours for which they are paid lower than the minimum monthly wage of about $240, according to an investigation by Canadian charity Cuso International and the Universidad Externado de Colombia.
""There is a situation of structural violence against women migrants in Colombia, which can be seen in working environments,"" Alejandro Matos, Cuso International's Colombia director, told Reuters. 
The investigation found that while the average monthly income of a formally employed Colombian woman is 1.45 million pesos (about $400), a Venezuelan woman working informally receives 785,000 pesos - below the legal minimum wage.
In recent years Colombia has become home to more than 1.72 million Venezuelans - including 844,000 women - who have fled political, social, and economic crisis in their homeland.
Most migrants in Colombia are undocumented and scrape by in major cities working jobs in security, hairdressing, domestic services, retail or by selling what they can in the streets.
In some cases, women migrants face xenophobia and stigmatization related to sex work, the study found. 
Gender-based violence against Venezuelan migrants rose 40% in Colombia during the first nine months of the year, versus the same period a year ago, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said on Wednesday in a separate statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The United States unilaterally blacklisted Libya's Kaniyat militia and its leader on Wednesday after Russia last week prevented a U.N. Security Council committee from imposing sanctions over human rights abuses by the group.
The U.S. sanctions were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, which allows the U.S. government to target human rights violators worldwide by freezing assets and prohibiting Americans from doing business with them.
""Mohamed al-Kani and the Kaniyat militia have tortured and killed civilians during a cruel campaign of oppression in Libya,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The United States and Germany earlier this month proposed that the U.N. Security Council's 15-member Libya sanctions committee impose an asset freeze and travel ban on Kaniyat militia and al-Kani. 
However, such a move has to be agreed by consensus and Russia said on Friday it could not approve the sanctions because it wanted to see more evidence first that they had killed civilians.
The Libyan city of Tarhouna, which was recaptured in June by the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), had for years been controlled by the Kaniyat militia run by the local Kani family, which fought alongside Khalifa Haftar’s eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA).
Last month Libyan authorities dug up 12 bodies from four unmarked graves in Tarhouna, adding to the scores of corpses already discovered since June. 
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Last month the two major sides in the country's war - the GNA and the LNA - agreed a ceasefire. 
Turkey backs the GNA. Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt support the LNA. Those foreign powers have been cited in earlier U.N. documents as supplying weapons in defiance of the arms embargo.

The holiday weekend is expected to fuel a surge of infections in the United States, which leads the world with soaring COVID-19 infections and the daily toll on Tuesday climbing above 2,000, the highest 24-hour tally since early May.
""All the Thanksgiving travel ensures no one will catch us, either,"" said Dr. Tatiana Prowell of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
""The U.S. 'each person for himself' mindset is killing hundreds of thousands of us. Devastating to watch,"" Prowell said on Twitter.
Hopes for a successful vaccine, boosted by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), have given world stock markets a lift.
But an approved vaccine is unlikely to be widely available for months while scientists insist on the continued need for vigilance and politicians consider curbs for Christmas amid a second wave of the pandemic.
Germany on Wednesday reported a record 410 COVID-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, before its 16 federal state leaders and Chancellor Angela Merkel were due to discuss an extension of restrictions into December and for Christmas and New Year. 
Italy reported 853 deaths related to COVID-19 on Tuesday, soaring from 630 the day before and the highest daily toll since March 28. 
But new infections and the number of people in hospital with the virus in France dropped sharply as a national lockdown went into its fourth week.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday people could start being vaccinated by the end of the year.
""We will very likely, and pending authorisation by health authorities, start vaccination of the most vulnerable populations, hence the elderly, as soon as the end of December, early January,"" he said in a televised address.
Air France-KLM is among airlines gearing up to transport millions of doses of temperature-sensitive vaccines.
""It's going to be a major logistics challenge,"" said Air France cargo chief Christophe Boucher.
Macron said France will start easing its COVID-19 lockdown this weekend so that by Christmas, shops, theatres and cinemas will reopen and people can spend the holiday with their families.
THANKSGIVING CHALLENGES
The four nations of the United Kingdom, which have devised their own pandemic policies until now, agreed to relax restrictions for Christmas to allow up to three households to meet at home for five days.
The government will spend 280 billion pounds ($374 billion) this year to ""get our country through"" the pandemic, finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned against relaxing lockdowns too quickly.
""We must learn from the summer and not repeat the same mistakes,"" she told the European Parliament. ""Relaxing too fast and too much is a risk for a third wave after Christmas.""
Lithuania and Norway extended restrictions until mid-December.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden will give a speech on Wednesday highlighting the challenges facing Americans as Thanksgiving approaches, challenges incumbent President Donald Trump has repeatedly failed to address over the last year and into the final days of his tenure.
The United States has the world's highest COVID death toll at nearly 260,000, with more than 1.4 million infections and its hospitals fast filling up.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday a jailed Kurdish leader has ""blood on his hands"", scotching some hopes that a reform plan could lead to wider liberties for the opposition and dissidents.
Erdogan promised a slate of judicial and economic reforms two weeks ago, leading to expectations of the possible release of politicians, including Kurdish ones, and human rights advocates from jail.
Former deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc, a founder of Erdogan's AK Party in 2001, added to that speculation with a call for the release of Selahattin Demirtas, former leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).
Erdogan slammed those comments on Wednesday saying: ""It offended me that he suggested everyone read the book written by a terrorist,"" referring to Arinc urging people to read a book by Demirtas to understand Turkey's Kurdish issue. 
""There is no Kurdish issue in this country,"" Erdogan said. Demirtas, he said, defends ""terrorism"" and has the ""blood of thousands of Kurds on his hands"". 
Arinc resigned on Tuesday from the presidential advisory board. 
Demirtas has been in prison for more than four years on charges related to protests against the Turkish army's inaction during a militant attack on the Syrian Kurdish town Kobani.
Erdogan said the AKP would carry out the reforms together with its Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) coalition partner - staunch opponents of the Kurdish political movement. The details of the plans to make judicial processes easier and quicker have yet to be made public.
HDP lawmaker Meral Danis Bestas, a senior figure in the party, dismissed the reform pledges as politicking.
""This reform narrative is not sincere. This is a party which has been in power for 18 years and which has until now totally trampled on the law,"" she told Reuters.
""It has one aim: to win back the support which has been lost,"" she said. The next election is not due for three years, but the parties have been dipping in the polls.
The HDP, chaired by Demirtas between 2014 and 2018, has had thousands of its officials and members arrested in recent years. It has generally been accused of links to Kurdish militants fighting an insurgency in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.

Erdogan on Wednesday defended the removal of elected HDP mayors from posts in the southeast. The state has appointed caretaker mayors to 59 out of a total of 65 municipalities that the HDP won in local elections in March 2019.

""It is a number that health professionals, scientists have told us is sufficiently rigorous and restrictive to prevent another surge in infections,"" he said.
The restrictions will be negotiated with regional authorities, meaning some changes could still be introduced. 
Some regional health chiefs, including in Catalonia and Madrid, are advocating for a less stringent limit of 10 people for holiday gatherings. 
While the rate of infection in Spain has slowed in the past month, its overall tally of nearly 1.6 million cases is the second highest in western Europe after France.

MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels during fighting with Ukrainian government troops, international investigators say. All 298 people on board were killed, two-thirds of them Dutch nationals.
After years of collecting evidence, a Dutch-led international Joint Investigation Team (JIT) last year said the missile launcher used to hit the civilian airplane came from a Russian army base just across the border.
The Dutch government holds Moscow responsible, and three Russians and a Ukrainian are on trial for murder. None of the suspects are in custody. One, Russian Oleg Pulatov, is represented in court proceedings; the other three are being tried in absentia.
Russia has always denied involvement and has promoted a range of alternative theories, which the investigators rejected as unsupported by evidence.
Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said the defence had not provided a clear alternative scenario to investigate, while information on several other possible explanations was already part of the case file.
Steenhuis said the court would like to hear Pulatov in person, and would not submit written questions to him as his lawyers had requested.
He added the court would also like to hear from the other suspects -- Russians Sergey Dubinsky and Igor Girkin, and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko -- who have never cooperated with the court.
The court also called for a new questioning of witnesses who reported seeing the missile launcher on July 17, 2014, as well as the owner of the field from which the missile is believed to have been launched.
Judges also ruled that a new effort should be made to speak to the leader of Russia's 53rd brigade, which has been identified by investigators as having transported the missile launcher.
The hearing of the case will resume on Feb 1, 2021.
Last month Russia abandoned discussions on liability for the crash with the Netherlands and Australia, saying the countries were not genuinely interested in establishing the truth and had launched legal proceedings against it.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Hundreds of people in low lying areas in India's southern city of Chennai were evacuated and more than 150 relief centres were on standby ahead of a ""very severe cyclonic storm"", government officials said on Wednesday.
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said ""Nivar"" was likely to cross between ""midnight of 25th and early hours of 26th November"" and was likely to bring very heavy rainfall.
Areas in and around Chennai witnessed intense spells of rain, accompanied by strong winds on Wednesday.
The cyclone was likely to damage houses and roads, uproot power lines and trees and destroy crops along India's south east coast, the IMD said in a statement.
Edappadi Palaniswami, Tamil Nadu state's chief minister, has declared Wednesday and Thursday as public holidays in some areas, ordered the halting of bus services, advised fishermen not venture to sea and asked people to stay indoors. 
Many automobile companies in Chennai, home to a flourishing automobile industry and dubbed the ""Detroit of South Asia"", shut operations on Wednesday, and some were likely to remain closed on Thursday, a person familiar with the matter said.
Vessels in the city's port have been moved to sea and port operations will likely remain shut until the cyclone makes landfall, a senior port official said.
Chennai's airport will remain closed until 7 a.m local time (0130 GMT) on Thursday, India's aviation minister said in a post on Twitter.
Local government officials in Chennai released water from a major reservoir, cleared fallen trees and readied relief centres as they evacuated people from low lying areas.
""Residents are shifted from low lying areas close to Adyar river. They are shifted to the neighbouring relief camps as an advance precaution,"" Chennai official Alby John said on Twitter.

Authorities have so far evacuated 528 people and 150 more relief shelters are being readied in the city, officials said.

Azerbaijan and Armenia signed a Russia-brokered ceasefire on Nov. 10 that halted six weeks of clashes in the mountain enclave, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is mainly populated by ethnic Armenians. 
Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in the enclave under the ceasefire deal, which locked in Azeri advances. Turkey has no peacekeepers there but has signed an agreement with Russia to set up a joint centre to monitor the ceasefire.
""We have the opportunity to develop and expand this more. We discussed these development and expansion efforts with Mr Putin too,"" Erdogan said.
He said the process of maintaining the ceasefire could be taken ""to a different level"" if other countries in the region were involved but did not name any in his public comments.
Turkey and Russia have been holding talks on the parameters of the monitoring centre, but a Turkish source told Reuters the two were at odds over Ankara's wish to set up an independent military observation post on Azeri territory.
Turkey has long backed its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, and criticised the co-chairs of the so-called Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Co-operation security and rights watchdog for not resolving the conflict in decades of mediation. The Minsk Group includes France, Russia and the United States. 
France, whose population includes between 400,000 to 600,000 people of Armenian origin, wants international supervision of the ceasefire because of concerns that Russia and Turkey may cut Western powers out of future peace talks.

Erdogan said ""discomfort"" voiced over the agreement by some co-chairs of the Minsk Group ""has no worth whatsoever.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - In his first high-level meeting with Beijing, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said stable ties with China were important, as his country pursues a balancing act with its neighbour. 
On Wednesday, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi met Suga at the end of his two-day trip in Japan, marking the first high-level visit since Suga was elected as new leader in September.
""A stable relationship between the two countries is important not only for Japan and China but also for the region and the international community,"" Suga told Wang in a meeting that lasted about 20 minutes. 
The visit by China's foreign minister comes amid growing concerns over Beijing's assertiveness in the region.
While Suga has steered clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by Japan's ally the United States, he has moved to counter its influence by deepening ties with Australia and choosing Vietnam and Indonesia for his first overseas trip.
Japan's security strategy is grounded on its alliance with the United States, but it also has pursued economic interests with China, its top trading partner. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping wants to build ""good working relations"" with his Japanese counterpart, Wang said, citing a message from Xi that he delivered to Suga.
Wang also said that bilateral relations have ""finally returned"" to a normal development path.
Wang met his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi on Tuesday. They agreed to cooperate on trade and fighting the coronavirus, but maintained their stances on territorial disputes, leaving a security concern unresolved.
Japan and China agreed to resume coronavirus-hit business travel this month and to continue talks on disputed isles in the East China Sea.
""I hope both sides will handle the issue calmly and properly, so that stable improvement in ties and further development in Sino-Japanese relations won't be affected,"" Wang told reporters after his meeting with Suga, referring to the situation in the East China Sea.
Still, during Wang's visit, top Japanese officials reiterated concerns over China's continuing activity in the area, but Wang stood by Beijing's stance that it was protecting its sovereignty. 
Japan's government has complained of China's ""relentless"" intrusions in waters around the islets claimed by both nations.
Officials in Tokyo including Suga also repeatedly expressed concerns to Wang over developments in Hong Kong, a politically sensitive issue for Beijing. 
Meanwhile, both sides supported successful Olympic events, the Tokyo Olympics next year, and the Winter Olympics hosted by China in 2022. 

Pushing forward a three-way free trade deal with Japan and South Korea, Wang is headed to Seoul and will to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday.

Federal prosecutors have called the incident in the Italian-speaking southern canton of Ticino a suspected terrorist attack and taken charge of the investigation.
""Police investigations in 2017 revealed that the woman had formed a relationship via social media with a jihadist fighter from Syria,"" the Federal Office of Police (fedpol) tweeted.
Turkish authorities turned her back from the border to Syria when she tried to travel there to meet the man, and returned her to Switzerland at the time, it added. 
""The woman was suffering from mental health problems at this time. After returning to Switzerland, she was admitted to a psychiatric clinic,"" it added, saying she had not come to fedpol's attention in any terror-related investigation since 2017.
The suspect, a 28-year-old who lives in the area, was in custody after passersby subdued her until police could arrive. 
One victim sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries and another was lightly injured.
Neutral Switzerland has so far been spared the kind of large-scale jihadist attacks that prompted France and Germany this month to push for tighter European Union borders after suspected Islamist militants killed eight people in Paris, Nice and Vienna within a month.
But it has identified hundreds of residents deemed a threat and militants who have travelled to war zones.
Two men arrested in the town of Winterthur this month over possible links to a jihadist shooting attack in Vienna that killed four people on Nov. 2 visited the attacker in July.
In September, a man Swiss media dubbed the ""Emir of Winterthur"" and described as a leading Islamist militant in Switzerland was sentenced to 50 months in prison for ties to Islamic State.
Federal prosecutors have said that a fatal stabbing of a Portuguese man in September in the town of Morges, in western Switzerland, was still being investigated for a possible ""terrorist motive"". A Swiss-Turkish national has been arrested.

PARIS (Reuters) - Murtaza Khademi left his home in Afghanistan and smuggled himself into France because he thought he would be safe, but this week he encountered a different side of Europe: a police operation in which, he says, he was beaten with a truncheon.
""The police forces had no mercy. We thought they were humane people,"" he said on Tuesday night near a railway station in Paris where charities were distributing food. ""They are not like that at all."" 
Khademi was among dozens of migrants and asylum seekers who had pitched pop-up tents on a central square in the city in an organised protest intended to attract attention to their precarious living conditions.
Police in riot gear moved in to disperse the protest on Monday night. Officers tussled with protesters as they tried to drag them out of the tents.
Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin said some of the scenes were ""shocking"" and that officers who behaved unacceptably would be punished. Officials said though the protest was illegal so police were within their rights to disperse it.
Khademi, 27, said he was inside his tent when the police arrived and beat him with batons. He escaped, but said he left his belongings inside the tent, so now he had nothing.
From Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, he said he travelled through Pakistan, Iran, and the Balkans to reach France. He previously stayed at a migrant camp on the edge of Paris, but that was dispersed last week.
Now, he said, he moves around the streets looking for a place to bed down. Many ordinary French people were supportive, he said, but the police were hostile. 
""I thought that France was a good place and that its people are European, and that's why we came here, but the immigrants were not well received,"" he said, speaking in Dari, one of the languages used in Afghanistan.

""We have no way back; we have to stay here and endure the situation because we have no other choice.""

European countries are grappling with how to contain the spread of the disease at the same time as their inhabitants want to celebrate Christmas and New Year.
""There is light at the end of the tunnel. We must hold on,"" Solberg told a news conference.

But there are regional disparities and authorities are most concerned about the situation in the capital Oslo and other major cities.

On Nov. 6, Oslo shut down theatres, cinemas, training centres and swimming pools to contain the spread of the coronavirus, with bars and restaurants no longer able to serve alcohol, leading to many establishments closing down altogether.

MANILA (Reuters) - Tensions in the South China Sea will increase due to a U.S.-China rivalry that could be kept in check, if only Southeast Asian countries took a united stand to influence the status quo, a top Philippine security official said on Wednesday.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was caught up in the battle for regional influence but it could do more to ensure stability and should take a common approach, Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told a security forum.
""Where is the ASEAN in this superpower rivalry? Despite its avowed ASEAN centrality, it is anything but,"" Lorenzana said.
""ASEAN would exert considerable influence on issues and events in the South China Sea if only it could act as one.""
Lorenzana's remarks are unusually blunt for a minister from within the 10-member bloc, which rarely speaks up as a group against militarisation or perceived acts of aggression, with some states worried about angering Beijing or Washington.
The Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam have overlapping claims with China and all but Brunei have been involved in standoffs this year with Chinese vessels.
China says it has historical sovereignty over nine-tenths of the South China Sea. It does not recognise a 2016 international arbitral ruling that invalidated those claims. 
Lorenzana said the issue was front and centre during discussions since May with counterparts in Japan, China, Australia, France and the United States. 
""What do this tell us? That the South China Sea is important to a lot of nations,"" he said.
""That the tension in the South China Sea will continue to rise as China will continue to accuse the U.S. and other nations of provocation and destabilisation ... that the West is trying to contain the rise of China.""
China has stepped up its coastguard presence and military drills this year, including near islands also claimed by Vietnam, while the United States has deployed warships to demonstrate freedom of navigation. They accuse each other of deliberate provocations. 
Lorenzana said Southeast Asia worries the risk of armed conflict is rising. 

U.S. ally the Philippines, he said, ""will be involved whether she likes it or not.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - A car with slogans scrawled on its sides crashed into the gate of the office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Wednesday and police arrested the driver, a Reuters witness said.
Reuters pictures from the scene showed police inspecting the estate car at the gate with the words ""Stop Globalisation Politics"" written in white on its right side and ""You damn killers of children and old people"" on the other.
""The Chancellor, other members of the government and people working in the Chancellery were not in danger at any time,"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert said, adding that the incident had caused only minor damage.
It was not clear if Merkel was inside the building, a white post-modernist structure set across a square from the Reichstag building that houses Germany's parliament and well set back from any main roads. Dozens of police and a fire engine attended the incident.
The driver, who appeared to be in late middle age, was taken away in a wheelchair by police.
""We are establishing if the driver deliberately drove against (the gate),"" Berlin police said on Twitter. ""He has been taken into custody.""
A firefighter subsequently moved the car, which had a license plate from the northwestern county of Lippe, away from the gate. Both fence and car appeared largely undamaged.
Berlin is home to an active left-wing anti-globalisation scene, whose members have sought to stop development projects by big global companies and occupied empty houses.
Merkel was scheduled host a video conference of German state premiers on Wednesday, at which an extension to the coronavirus lockdown and further steps to combat the pandemic were due to be discussed.
Europe is on high alert after suspected Islamist militants killed eight people in Paris, Nice and Vienna in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Swiss police have identified a Swiss woman who knifed a victim in the neck and grabbed another by the throat in a Lugano department store as a known jihadist.
Four years ago, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, hijacked a truck then drove it into a crowded Berlin Christmas market, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leslie Chihuly, the wife and business driver behind glass artist Dale Chihuly, believes these are fighting times, especially for artists.
""If we don't have our paintings and art and music and culture and civility, then what do we have?"" said the president and chief executive of Chihuly, Inc, who chaired the board of the Seattle Symphony for nine years until 2018.
""What art does is create that thin veneer that separates us from our more base instincts. Without it, I don't like how life looks.""
Chihuly, 59, had a chat with Reuters about her personal, professional and philanthropic choices. 
Edited excerpts are below.
Q. What did your first job teach you?
A. My first job was probably when I around 14 or 15. I worked in a small boutique store on the Main Street in my hometown (Guymon, Oklahoma), and it was called The Vogue. 
I wanted to save up for a Christmas present for my mother. I loved having a job, having my own little bit of money in my purse. I also learned how to perfectly wrap gifts. I'm really good at gift wrapping.
Q. What was your toughest job?
A. Doing multiple jobs at the same time. I was doing the job of being a mother. I was doing the job at Chihuly with a lot of complexity and a lot of projects and issues. I was also simultaneously board chair of the Seattle Symphony, which is a huge job. It's more than a full-time job at times. 
Having all of those jobs at the same time and trying to balance the load, I found out that I can really push myself. I had to learn how to prioritize and also delegate. 
Q. It's a particularly bleak time for creative professionals such as artists and musicians. Do you have any advice for creative types?
A. I know it's a difficult time, but it's also a very fertile time. Dig deep and keep making work. Keep writing, keep making music, keep doing what you do. It's so essential. 
Q. What has been your biggest challenge this year?
A. We had to figure out how to blow glass safely. We closed our glass shops for quite a while. We have fewer people on our team now, but we're still spread out in three locations.
We can't travel and so many of our projects involve working all over the world and in different parts of the country. We had three different gallery shows - in London, Toronto and Seattle. Not being able to travel, we had to show those galleries how to install the shows without us.
Q. What's the best piece of job advice you've received?
A. Learn how to listen. If you can listen to others and you can listen to your employees and subject matter experts, you're going to make better decisions.
It's great to be proactive, to be leading and guiding, but you still have to have that back and forth.
Q. Do you have tips for someone just starting out right now? 
A. In every dark time or challenging time there are still opportunities, and there are opportunities for creative approaches on how to do things. There are always goods and services that people need and there are always those needs to be filled. 
There's always a path forward. You need to draw a support team around you and know that you can’t do it by yourself.
Q. What is your work-from-home set up?
A. I like to move around a lot, so I don't have one desk where I sit and work. I use the couch in our TV room for doing my Zooms because I like having a piece of art behind it. It's a Samuel Levi Jones, one of his paintings, and it's made of book covers.
Q. Where do you want to go when the world opens up again?
A. My three ""I"" countries: Ireland, Italy and Indonesia. I spent my junior year abroad in Ireland. Dale and I share a deep love of Ireland. It has to do with the arts, the music, literature and nature. 
Italy is work and pleasure-related. We always have projects we want to do in Italy. 
Indonesia would be more for fun because that's where I've been going in recent years for diving.

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, has revealed that she had a miscarriage, an extraordinarily personal disclosure coming from a high-profile British royal.
The wife of Prince Harry and former actress wrote about the experience in detail in an opinion article published in the New York Times on Wednesday, saying that it took place one July morning when she was caring for Archie, the couple's son.
""I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second,"" Meghan wrote, describing how she felt a sharp cramp after picking up Archie from his crib, and dropped to the floor with him in her arms, humming a lullaby to keep them both calm.
Meghan described how she and her husband were both in tears as she lay in a hospital bed hours later.
""Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few,"" she wrote.
""In the pain of our loss, my husband and I discovered that in a room of 100 women, 10 to 20 of them will have suffered from miscarriage. Yet despite the staggering commonality of this pain, the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame, and perpetuating a cycle of solitary mourning.""
The intimate details shared in the article are strikingly at odds with the usual policy of senior members of the British royal family, who reveal almost nothing about their personal lives.
Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, has never discussed her private life in any media article or interview in her 68-year reign.
However, there is intense global media interest in the senior royals, especially when it comes to family matters such as the birth of children.
Harry's older brother Prince William and his wife Kate appeared in front of TV camera crews and photographers outside the London hospital where Kate gave birth to her three children shortly after each birth, each time with their newborn baby.
Despite the media frenzy, however, William and Kate have revealed almost nothing of substance about their home life.
""MOTHER, FEMINIST, ADVOCATE"" 
A source close to Harry said the Duke had discussed the article with the royal family beforehand. 
Meghan and Harry married in May 2018 in a glittering ceremony televised around the world, but the period after their wedding was tumultuous, with the couple falling out publicly with some British media and opening up about their struggles.
They stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States earlier this year to try and forge a new role for themselves outside the constraints of life in Britain's strictly codified royal bubble.
The byline on the New York Times article was ""Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex"", and she was described as ""a mother, feminist and advocate"".
Meghan wrote that 2020 had brought many people to breaking points, and called on people to put aside political differences and other divisions and show some care for each other.
""So this Thanksgiving, as we plan for a holiday unlike any before — many of us separated from our loved ones, alone, sick, scared, divided and perhaps struggling to find something, anything, to be grateful for — let us commit to asking others, 'Are you OK?',"" she wrote.

""As much as we may disagree, as physically distanced as we may be, the truth is that we are more connected than ever because of all we have individually and collectively endured this year.""

French police opened a probe after photos and videos on social media showed police officers hitting demonstrators as they moved to clear out migrants' tents late on Monday. Darmanin had called the images ""shocking"".
On Wednesday the minister told France 2 television that police officers who had behaved unacceptably during the operation would be punished.
But he added: ""I reaffirm my confidence in the police prefect (Didier Lallement)... I am not going to blame all police officers who intervened in this square, nor the prefect of police for the actions of a few of them.""
Protesters waving flags and placards staged a demonstration on Tuesday evening against police violence and in support of the migrants.
Like many other European countries, France has taken an increasingly tough stance on illegal migration, especially since a massive inflow of refugees and asylum seekers, mostly from Muslim countries in the Middle East and beyond, in 2015-16.

The issue has driven support for far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who is likely to be President Emmanuel Macron's main opponent in the next presidential election in 2022.

Most of them were stranded during the weekend but rescue efforts have been hampered by the remote location of the island. 
New Zealand's Department of Conservation (DOC) said in total 97 pilot whales and three dolphins died in the stranding, adding that they were notified of the incident on Sunday.
""Only 26 of the whales were still alive at this point, the majority of them appearing very weak, and were euthanised due to the rough sea conditions and almost certainty of there being great white sharks in the water which are brought in by a stranding like this,” said DOC Biodiversity Ranger Jemma Welch.
Mass strandings are reasonably common on the Chatham Islands with up to 1,000 animals dying in a single stranding in 1918.
Mass whale strandings have occurred throughout recorded modern history, and why it happens is a question that has puzzled marine biologists for years.

In late September, several hundred whales died in shallow waters off the Australian coast in one of the world's biggest mass whale strandings.

Hundreds of people have been killed since fighting began on Nov. 4, more than 41,000 refugees have fled to Sudan and there are reports of militias targeting civilians.
""I expressed my great concern regarding increasing ethnic-targeted violence, numerous casualties and violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law,"" Josep Borrell said late on Tuesday after speaking to Ethiopia's foreign minister.
A 72-hour government deadline for Tigray forces to surrender is due to expire on Wednesday evening. The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party spearheading the fighting, has rejected the ultimatum. 
Ethiopia has described the fighting as an internal law enforcement matter, a position Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed reiterated in a statement on Wednesday. ""We reject any interference in our internal affairs,"" he said.
Borrel signalled his support for the African Union (AU) bloc's attempts to mediate. ""That is the only way forward to avoid further destabilisation,"" he said.
Three AU envoys - former presidents Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and Kgalema Motlanthe of South Africa - were due to arrive in Addis Ababa on Wednesday, two diplomatic sources told Reuters. 
With global alarm rising fast, European nations raised the conflict at a closed-doors meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, diplomats said.
Members of the council expressed concern, diplomats said, but South Africa, Niger and Tunisia urged more time for regional mediation efforts before the council considers action.

REGIONAL WAVES
The conflict is impacting an already turbulent region.
Tigrayans forces have fired rockets at the neighbouring country of Eritrea, and Ethiopian soldiers have been pulled from peacekeeping missions in Somalia and South Sudan.
In Somalia, Ethiopia has disarmed several hundred Tigrayans in an AU peacekeeping force fighting al Qaeda-linked militants. Three soldiers of Tigrayan ethnicity were also sent home from a U.N. peacekeeping force in South Sudan, a diplomatic and security source told Reuters on Wednesday. 
The U.N. mission in South Sudan said it was aware of the three soldiers' repatriation, and that its human rights division was following up. Although Ethiopia is ultimately responsible for the conduct and movement of the roughly 2,000 troops it had in South Sudan, the statement said, discrimination due to ethnicity could violate international law. 
""In this regard, UNMISS has requested access to any soldier who might be in need of protection under international law.""
Billene Seyoum, a spokeswoman for the Ethiopian prime minister's office, told Reuters that the situation in South Sudan ""would be the same"" as Somalia, meaning soldiers sent home were under investigation for links to the TPLF.
On Tuesday, Ethiopia's state-appointed human rights watchdog accused a Tigrayan youth group of killing about 600 civilians as federal and local forces both claimed advances in the war.
Reuters has been unable to verify statements made by either side since phone and internet connections to Tigray are down and access to the area is strictly controlled.
Long lines of cars were forming in front of gas stations in Mekelle, the Tigray regional capital, according to satellite images taken on Nov. 23 and provided to Reuters by Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR). Petrol has been rationed in Tigray since the conflict begun. 
Images taken the same date showed Ethiopian troops in the historic town of Axum and trenches that had been dug across the runway of the local airport.

A source briefed on the matter told Reuters the UAE had temporarily stopped issuing new visas to Afghans, Pakistanis and citizens of several other countries over security concerns.
The source did not say what those concerns were but said the visa ban was expected to last for a short period.
Last week, Pakistan's foreign ministry said the UAE had stopped processing new visas for its citizens and those of some other countries. 
It said it was seeking information from the UAE on the reason for the suspension but that it thought it was related to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The Pakistani ministry and the source said those holding valid visas were not affected by the new restrictions and could enter the UAE.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is due to visit South Korea on Wednesday amid talk of a trip to Seoul by Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
Wang, who is also a state councillor, is scheduled to arrive in Seoul after spending two days in Tokyo and will meet his counterpart Kang Kyung-wha on Thursday, according to South Korea's foreign ministry. 
The two will discuss a range of bilateral, regional and global issues, including North Korea, the coronavirus and an incoming U.S. administration under Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, Seoul officials said. 
Wang's trip comes as the two countries discuss the possibility of Xi's visit to Seoul, which had been expected early this year but was postponed as the pandemic disrupted the diplomatic calendar.
Kang said early this month that both sides were arranging a Xi trip on the assumption he would come ""as soon as the COVID-19 situation stabilises.""
Wang is the second senior Chinese diplomat to be in South Korea since the coronavirus emerged in China late last year, following an August visit by Yang Jiechi, a member of the Communist Party Politburo. 
Both countries have largely successfully tackled their coronavirus outbreaks.
The two countries remain at odds over a U.S. missile defence system installed in South Korea in 2017, which Washington and Seoul say is designed to defend from North Korean missile threats but China fears could undercut its security interests. 

China, North Korea's sole major ally, has played a key role in efforts to put a negotiated end to its nuclear programmes in return for U.S. sanctions relief, but talks have stalled since last year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has cancelled the citizenship of an Algerian-born Muslim cleric who was convicted of leading a terrorist cell that planned to bomb a football match in Melbourne in 2005, Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said on Wednesday.
Abdul Nacer Benbrika is now the first person to be stripped of his citizenship while still in Australia.
""If it's a person who's posing a significant terrorist threat to our country, then we'll do whatever is possible within Australian law to protect Australians,"" Dutton told reporters in Brisbane. 
Benbrika was convicted on three terrorism charges. He was jailed for 15 years for directing a terrorist group, being a member of a terrorist group and possessing material associated with planning of a terrorist act.
Benbrika remains in an Australian prison despite finishing his sentence. Under Australian law Canberra is permitted to detain anyone convicted of terror offences for up to three years after their sentence finishes.
Lawyers for Benbrika have appealed against his ongoing detention. He has 90 days to appeal the cancellation of his visa and return to Algeria.
Under Australian law, a person can only be stripped of their citizenship if they are dual citizens, thereby preventing people from being made stateless.
Australia used the powers in 2019 to strip the citizenship of Neil Prakash, an alleged Islamic State recruiter who is imprisoned in Turkey. Australia argued he was a dual citizen as he also has Fijian citizenship, though Fiji denied the claim - souring the bilateral relationship.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand faced criticism from international rights groups on Wednesday for bringing charges of insulting the monarchy against protest leaders who have challenged King Maha Vajiralongkorn as well as the government.
A police source said a total of 15 protest leaders had been summoned to acknowledge lese majeste charges over comments made at protests in September and October, when they spoke about the king's behaviour, lifestyle and spending.
""No one should be arrested or imprisoned merely for criticizing public officials or a system of government,"" said human rights lawyer Amal Clooney in a statement from the Clooney Foundation for Justice.
The Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights said ""lese-majeste must not be used to criminalize pro-democracy protest leaders and participants"".
Responding to the criticism, government spokeswoman Rachada Dhnadirek said: ""The government has been open-minded to rights and freedoms despite many imprudent expressions which offend the majority. The government must used its authorised powers.""
The royal insult laws have not been used since 2018 and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in June that they were not being used at the request of the king.
Since July, protesters have been calling for the removal of Prayuth, a former junta leader. They also demand a new constitution and curbs on the king's powers.
Summonses for protest leaders came ahead of a demonstration planned on Wednesday to call on the king to give up the personal control he took over a palace fortune valued in the tens of billions of dollars.
Protesters shifted the venue at the last minute from the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the royal assets. Police blocked roads there with shipping containers and razor wire - adding to the traffic chaos in Bangkok's rush hour.
The protest will now take place at the headquarters of Siam Commercial Bank (OTC:SMUUY), in which the king's stake of more than 23% makes him the largest shareholder.
""Transferring the crown property to the king’s property is equivalent to a robbery of the nation’s wealth,"" the FreeYouth protest group said, referring to a 2017 change in the law that gave the king control of the Crown Property Bureau. 

Details of its assets are not made public but they are estimated to be worth more than $30 billion.

Hundreds of people have been killed since fighting began on Nov. 4, more than 41,000 refugees have fled to Sudan and there are reports of militias targeting civilians.
""I expressed my great concern regarding increasing ethnic-targeted violence, numerous casualties and violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law,"" Josep Borrell said in statement late on Tuesday.
Ethiopia has described the fighting as an internal law enforcement matter, a position Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed reiterated in a statement on Wednesday.
""We reject any interference in our internal affairs,"" he said.
Tigrayans forces have fired rockets at the neighbouring country of Eritrea, and Ethiopian soldiers have been pulled from peacekeeping missions in Somalia and South Sudan.
In Somalia, Ethiopia has disarmed several hundred Tigrayans in an African Union peacekeeping force fighting al Qaeda-linked militants. Three soldiers of Tigrayan ethnicity were also sent home from a U.N. peacekeeping force in South Sudan, a diplomatic and security source told Reuters. 
The U.N. force was not immediately available for comment 
Billene Seyoum, a spokeswoman for the Ethiopian prime minister's office, told Reuters that the situation in South Sudan ""would be the same"" as in Somalia, meaning those soldiers that were sent home were under investigation for links to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party spearheading the fighting.
On Tuesday, Ethiopia's state-appointed human rights watchdog accused a Tigrayan youth group of killing about 600 civilians as federal and local forces both claimed advances in a three-week war in the country's mountainous north.

Reuters has been unable to verify statements made by either side since phone and internet connections to Tigray are down and access to the area is strictly controlled.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Having once had the highest COVID-19 rate in Southeast Asia, Singapore has all but eradicated the virus after reporting 14 days without any new local cases on Tuesday, and saying it had snuffed out the last cluster of infection at a worker dormitory.
The cramped dormitories for young, low-wage labourers, mainly from Bangladesh, India and China had been at the centre of the city-state's spiralling cases earlier this year.
While Singapore has reported zero local cases for two weeks, there has been a trickle of infected people arriving from abroad who have been immediately isolated, authorities say.
Singapore was one of the first countries to report a COVID-19 case outside of China, where the virus first surfaced, on Jan. 23. It has recorded more than 58,000 cases, but nearly all them have recovered and its fatality rate is the world's lowest with just 28 deaths.
The vast majority of Singapore's cases occurred in dormitories. Authorities imposed strict quarantines at the facilities, drawing criticism from human rights groups. But it still took many months to stifle the clusters there even as cases in the broader community stayed low.
Tuesday marked the first time Singapore said it had no live clusters of infection across the island since the start of its outbreak.
When daily infections were peaking in April, the city-state had the most cases of the disease in Southeast Asia. Cases in Indonesia and the Philippines have since eclipsed its numbers.

Singapore had to impose a two-month lockdown to curb the spread of the disease in April. While life has returned to relative normal since then, mask wearing is mandatory, there are strict social distancing rules, and the island's borders remain largely closed.

Lam was delivering her annual policy address in the semi autonomous city's legislature. She had postponed her speech by more than a month in order to go to Beijing for talks on how China can help with the finance hub's economic recovery.
The central government's role in the former British colony has been in the spotlight, in particular with the imposition in June of a security law after months of pro-democracy protests - the most intense in decades - last year.
""In the past year or so, Hong Kong has experienced the most severe political challenges since its return to the motherland,"" Lam said. ""One of our urgent priorities is to restore ... constitutional order and political system from chaos.""
Lam said the government will introduce a bill to enhance ""oath-taking"" by civil servants and conduct widespread public education ""to enhance the understanding of the rule of law"".
She accused foreign governments and legislatures of intensifying interference in Hong Kong's affairs, which she said were China's internal affairs, and that their actions were jeopardising national security.
Last year's protests were triggered in part by fears in Hong Kong that the central government was whittling away the freedoms granted when the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula.
Lam, the city's least popular leader post-handover, presented her annual policy address via video last year after some opposition lawmakers disrupted the legislative session, jeering as she started her speech.

She did not face any opposition this year, after pro-democracy lawmakers resigned en masse after four of their colleagues were disqualified after China's parliament gave city authorities powers to oust lawmakers without court scrutiny.

Taiwan condemned the plan after the pro-Beijing Hong Kong-based newspaper Ta Kung Pao first reported on it this month. China's widely-read Global Times tabloid has said the list could include senior Taiwanese government officials.
China claims self-governing Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan's government says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, although China rejects this position.
Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said the ""list of diehard Taiwan secessionists"" now under consideration was only aimed at a very small number of independence supporters and those who fund them.
""It is absolutely not aimed at the vast majority of Taiwan compatriots,"" she told a regular news briefing in Beijing.
Zhu did not give details or a timeframe, saying only that Beijing would take ""targeted steps to severely punish in accordance with the law"" those it viewed as hard-core backers of independence. 
Chinese media have said the 2005 Anti-Secession Law, which mandates the use of force if China judges Taiwan to have declared independence, as well as national security legislation, could be used to charge those on the list.
It is unclear how that would play out, as Chinese courts have no jurisdiction in Taiwan, and Taiwan's government leaders do not visit China.
The moves follows Beijing's July unveiling of new national security laws for Chinese-run Hong Kong that prescribe sentences ranging up to life terms for crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
Separately, Zhu said a Chinese court this week sentenced a Taiwanese citizen to four years in prison for espionage.
Last month, Chinese state television ran a series of programmes featuring ""confessions"" by Taiwanese spies, which Taiwan described as entrapment and another reason for people to fear visiting China.

In a speech on Wednesday that was delayed in order for her to consult Communist Party leaders in Beijing, Lam said her administration’s aim was to restore confidence following another tumultuous year. She spoke against the backdrop of a new wave of virus infections, an economy in deep contraction, worsening wealth inequality and political turmoil.
“The primary objective of this policy address is to look at ways to get Hong Kong out of the impasse and to restore people’s confidence as soon as possible,” she said in the speech, which cited President Xi Jinping’s vision for Hong Kong at the outset.
Lam said Hong Kong’s economy can benefit “from its proximity to the mainland and the central government’s long-standing support under the ‘one country, two systems’ principle.” The city’s “economic development will be given new impetus” by relations with China, she said.
Other highlights of her speech so far:
A resurgence in virus cases prompted new restrictions Tuesday, with the government shutting down bars and nightclubs and limiting the number of people at banquets. The outbreak has already delayed a Hong Kong-Singapore travel bubble in a blow to the economy and efforts to reopen the city.
The government has already allocated more than HK$310 billion ($40 billion) in virus stimulus this year and its tight fiscal situation means there’s limited room for more spending, Lam has said.
The economy is set to contract 6.1% this year, with mixed signs recently of a recovery. Exports resumed their declilne in October after a strong gain in the previous month.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",Japan PM Suga trips up with messy reversal on tourism campaign,"By Linda Sieg and Rocky Swift
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's abrupt decision to partially pause a domestic travel campaign amid rising COVID-19 cases - after insisting it would go ahead - looks likely to cost him support and may cloud his chances of a long-term tenure.
Suga, who took the top job in September after Shinzo Abe resigned citing illness, has enjoyed solid ratings of over 50%, buoyed by an image as a down-to-earth leader pushing popular policies such as lower mobile phone rates.
But critics said his reversal on a programme he has backed to bolster the economy even as new cases spiked was too little, too late, and risked leaving the image of a leader both stubborn and indecisive, without due care for public health.
""It's a display of indecisiveness that gives people a lot of reason to be resentful,"" said Sophia University professor Koichi Nakano. ""At this point, they (the government) still sound like they don't know what they are doing.""
Abe's own support ratings never recovered after sagging on the public's perception that his response to the pandemic was clumsy and slow.
Suga is currently serving out Abe's remaining term to next September and must win a ruling Liberal Democratic Party leadership race then in order to remain premier.
The policy fumble threatens his standing just two months into his premiership, with stiffer tests ahead, including the extent to which COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise, and whether Tokyo can host the postponed Summer Olympics in 2021. 
""His ratings will decline, almost certainly,"" said independent political analyst Atsuo Ito, pointing to the delay in partially pausing the campaign. ""The view may spread that he puts a priority on keeping the economy running rather than protecting people's lives.""
In brief remarks on Saturday - after a three-day holiday was underway - Suga said the government would suspend new travel reservations to areas hard hit by COVID-19 under its ""Go To Travel"" programme, which subsidises tourism.
Critics of the programme have said it risks spreading the infection from major cities to the countryside.
On Tuesday, the government said Osaka and the city of Sapporo in Hokkaido would be excluded as target destinations in the travel subsidy programme. No decision has been made on the capital of Tokyo.
Government officials have repeatedly said travel itself does not spread infections if steps such as wearing face masks are taken.
However, Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura, an infectious disease expert and member of a government advisory board, said it was clear greater movement of people boosted infection risk.
Experts advising the government - who on Friday had finally urged a partial pause in the Go To programme - had been ""somewhat forced"" to accept policies to help the economy despite such increased health risks, he told Reuters.
Opposition parties, who are also linking Suga to an alleged Abe funding scandal, quickly chimed in with criticism.
""The timing of the announcement was too late and both the timing and target areas are not clear,"" Tetsuro Fukuyama, secretary general of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, said on television.
Suga's long-term future hinges on the outcome of a general election that must be held by October 2021.
""If the LDP loses a lot of seats, he may be held responsible,"" said University of Tokyo political science professor Yu Uchiyama.

(Reuters) - They were on a mission to count sheep when they found something they had not counted on.
As a Utah helicopter crew buzzed over the southeastern part of the state looking for bighorn sheep last week, sitting beneath them in the middle of the desert was a bright shiny monolith, the stuff of sci-fi sagas.
Pilot Bret Hutchings of the state Department of Public Safety recalled someone on board spotting the gleaming metal object firmly implanted in a small clearing set against the redness of the rocks and sand below.
“He’s like, whoa, whoa, whoa, turn around, turn around,” Hutchings told KSL-TV in Salt Lake City. “There’s this thing, there’s this thing back there. We’ve got to go look at it.”
After Hutchings set their helicopter down in the remote area, which remains undisclosed to discourage a rush of gawkers, they got a closer look, but found ""no obvious indication"" of how it got there, the public safety department said.
Images released by the department show the monolith coming up to the shoulders of a man standing on the shoulders of another after the discovery last Wednesday.
Hutchings joked about the object's possible other-worldly origins and the obvious parallel to the classic 1968 Stanley Kubrick film, but thought the answer was more down to Earth.
""I’m assuming it is some new wave artist or something, or somebody who just is a big '2001: A Space Odyssey' fan,” he said.
In the film, an alien monolith is a recurring symbol that appears to play a key role in man's evolution from the apes.
Whatever the Utah object's origins, it has fired up the minds of conspiracy theorists and sci-fi fans on social media.
""Finally someone gets it!"" said Twitter user Dwight Jackson of Calgary, Alberta. ""This is the 2020 reset we've been waiting for! Where is the mothership...?""
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which owns the land, declined to comment late on Tuesday on its investigation into the matter. 

But it issued a reminder on Twitter that ""using, occupying, or developing the public lands or their resources without a required authorization is illegal, no matter what planet you are from.""

The rift was the latest chapter in a battle between China and the United States over U.S. claims that China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is a security threat. The United States imposed trade restrictions on Huawei in September.
Huawei has repeatedly denied being a security risk. 
Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the president's son, has made statements that ""darken the friendly atmosphere between the two countries and hurt the image of Brazil,"" the Chinese embassy wrote on Twitter. 
Brazil's right-wing government in early November joined the U.S.-led Clean Network, a digital alliance among more than 30 countries and big telecom companies that excludes technology that Washington views as manipulated by China such as Huawei's.
Part of the initiative focuses on building 5G mobile phone networks that exclude equipment from China's Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763). Brazil's top carriers, meanwhile, are already testing Huawei equipment for 5G and have said they would prefer to have as many options as possible.
Eduardo Bolsonaro on Monday referred in a tweet to Huawei technology as ""Chinese espionage"" before deleting the post.
In a post that remains visible, he wrote that the Clean Network initiative is meant to counteract ""enemies of liberty,"" such as the ""Chinese Communist Party.""
In a series of Twitter posts on Tuesday, the Chinese embassy called the comments ""totally unacceptable."" 
Huawei has said it abides by Brazil's laws and is available for any tests and clarifications authorities deem necessary.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office helped cover the costs of dinner parties held for his supporters, sources close to Abe told local media on Tuesday evening, in a possible violation of funding and election laws.
The resurfacing of the scandal, which dogged Abe in the last year of his tenure could damage his political reputation and also threatens to drag in successor Yoshihide Suga, who was Abe's right-hand man during his 2012-2020 term.
Politicians in Japan are forbidden to provide anything to constituents that could be construed as a gift. The rule is so strict that one cabinet minister quit in 2014 after distributing paper fans during the summer.
Abe vehemently denied his office had subsidized parties during parliamentary sessions last year where he was grilled by opposition lawmakers on his office's involvement in hosting the reception.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, he said he was aware of the accusations and promised that his office will ""fully cooperate"" with Tokyo prosecutors who are looking into the matter, but declined to comment further on the accusations. 
""He can't run or hide,"" opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan leader Yukio Edano said of Abe on Tuesday, adding that the revelation meant Abe had lied in parliament when he had denied his office subsidized parties.
""Prime Minister Suga was also the ringleader of the Abe administration in his position as chief cabinet secretary, and he can't escape that responsibility,"" Edano said, according to NHK.
Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, stepped down in September due to health problems, but has stayed on as a lower house lawmaker.
The opposition has demanded he address the accusations during a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, but the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) refused to concede to the request, saying it was ""unreasonable.""
Local media, including public broadcaster NHK, said Abe's office helped cover a shortfall of about 8 million yen ($76,540) over the last five years of his premiership to hold annual dinner parties at swanky hotels for his supporters, citing people close to the ex-PM.
Although each supporter paid about $48 for their attendance, the total cost of hosting the parties came to more than $190,000 over five years, exceeding the total amount collected from ticket sales and creating a gap covered by the ex-PM's office, NHK said.
Tokyo prosecutors are analysing hotel documents that suggest Abe's office partly subsidized the receptions, and conducted a voluntary questioning of Abe's former aides, media said on Monday.
In interviews with NHK, sources close to the ex-PM said staff members working for Abe had told their former boss when asked last year by Abe whether the office had partially footed the bills for parties that the ticket sales had covered the costs when in fact, they had not.

China, which claims the democratic island as its own, reacted with anger to his planned trip, which would have been the third visit by a senior U.S. official since August.

Taiwan will continue its environmental cooperation with the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to facilitate future visits, ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said.
China reacted with fury when U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar came to Taipei in August, followed by U.S. Undersecretary of State Keith Krach in September, sending fighter jets near the island each time.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pakistan gave U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres a dossier on Tuesday accusing India of stoking terrorism in Pakistan, a day after India provided a dossier to some U.N. Security Council members accusing militants from Pakistan of attempting an attack in the disputed Indian territory Kashmir.
The tit-for-tat moves come ahead of India joining the 15-member council for a two-year term starting Jan. 1, 2021. 
Pakistan's U.N. Ambassador Munir Akram accused India of violating international law, the U.N. Charter and Security Council resolutions by sponsoring terrorism. 
He said Pakistan called on Guterres and the international community ""to take note of Indian terrorism and subversion against Pakistan and to prevail on India to desist from these illegal and aggressive activities.""
A spokesperson for India's mission to the United Nations in New York denied the charges. 
""Pakistan can cry hoarse from the rooftops. But they cannot change the fact that they are the epicenter of terrorism,"" the spokesperson said. ""Their lies have no takers.""
The Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan, with both claiming Kashmir in full but ruling it in part. U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed since 1949 to observe a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir.
India said on Monday that four militants, belonging to the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, made their way into Indian Kashmir through a tunnel last week and opened fire when their truck was stopped for a routine inspection.
Pakistan has rejected allegations of any involvement in the alleged attack and said they were aimed at diverting attention from India's repression of the people of Kashmir.

The U.N. Security Council blacklisted the head of the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed in May last year after China dropped its objection to the move, ending a decade-long diplomatic impasse.

Biden had stressed the importance of protecting Northern Ireland's peace deal in the Brexit process in a call with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier in the month, after Biden won the Nov. 3 U.S. election against President Donald Trump.
Johnson's government is seeking a trade deal with the European Union but says it is willing to leave without one. That could complicate the situation at the sensitive Northern Irish border with Ireland - the UK's only land border with the EU.
Biden told journalists in Wilmington, Delaware, that the border must be open. 
""We do not want a guarded border,"" he said, answering a question from a reporter on what he would say to Brexit negotiators. 
The 1998 Good Friday peace deal that effectively ended Northern Ireland's 30 years of sectarian violence created institutions for cross-border cooperation on the island of Ireland.
Johnson put forward legislation in September that would break the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit divorce treaty that seeks to avoid a physical customs border between the British province and EU-member Ireland.
Biden, who has talked about the importance of his Irish heritage, warned months ago as the Democratic candidate for the presidency that the UK must honor the 1998 agreement as it withdraws from the bloc or there can be no separate U.S. trade deal.
Johnson has never met Biden and commentators have suggested the prime minister will have to work hard to foster the ""special relationship"" between the historic allies.
Ireland's prime minister said on Monday he hoped the outline of a Brexit free-trade deal would emerge by the end of this week, despite what the EU negotiator called ""fundamental divergences"" at talks.

Nearly 44,000 homes suffered total or partial damage in Nicaragua, said Nicaraguan Finance Minister Ivan Acosta, estimating the storms have cost the country $743 million in losses, according to government media site El 19.
Hurricane Eta alone impacted some 3 million people in seven Central American countries and caused up to $5.5 billion in damage, the IDB said, citing estimates from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Iota's economic toll has yet to be calculated, said the IDB.
The region was still recovering from deadly flooding and mudslides triggered by Eta when Iota walloped Central America.
The IDB said on Monday it will support reconstruction in the hardest-hit countries with up to $1.2 billion in new funds, plus up to $500 million reassigned from existing operations and money mobilized from other institutions working in the region.
""The IDB is totally committed to helping with the recovery and reconstruction of affected countries in Central America,"" said IDB president Mauricio Claver-Carone.

The Honduran central bank said on Monday that devastation caused by Eta will shave an additional percentage point from economic growth, which along with the fallout from coronavirus will lead to a record contraction of 8-9% in 2020.

In a televised address to the nation, Macron said the worst of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in France was over, but that restaurants, cafes and bars would have to stay shut until Jan. 20 to avoid triggering a third wave. 
""We must do everything to avoid a third wave, do everything to avoid a third lockdown,"" Macron said. 
After curfew measures in major French cities in mid-October failed to produce the results the government had hoped for, it imposed a one-month lockdown on Oct. 30, albeit less strict than a lockdown that ran from March 17 to May 11.
Positive trends including a decline in hospitalisations for COVID-19 infections, combined with pressure from business lobbies who say they are facing financial ruin, have led to calls to start loosening the lockdown as soon as possible. 
Macron's government is keen to stress to people they should expect only a gradual reopening of the economy. 
On Saturday, shops will reopen but people will still need a document to venture out. They will now be allowed to exercise for three hours instead of one, and within a 20-km (12-1/2-mile) radius of their homes, versus the 1 km (two-thirds of a mile) allowed now.
In mid-December, the lockdown will be lifted if the number of new cases has fallen to around 5,000 a day, Macron said, but a curfew would be imposed from 9 p.m. France registered over 9,000 cases on Tuesday, and crossed the 50,000 deaths milestone. 
CHRISTMAS
Many French likely let out a sigh of relief as Macron said people will be free to travel across the country to see their loved ones during the end-of-year holiday and leave home to socialise on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, despite the 9 p.m. curfew around these dates. 
But no public gatherings will be allowed these evenings and ski resorts won't reopen before January.
""The Christmas holidays won't be the same as before, that's for sure,"" Macron said.
French officials say people began disregarding social distancing rules too quickly after the first lockdown, leading to one of the most rampant second waves of the virus in Europe. 
Critics of the government say it has failed to put in place an efficient test-and-trace system and to instil a sense of personal responsibility among the public, relying on arcane rules decided from the top.
Acknowledging the shortcomings of the testing system, Macron said it would be reorganised so that test results will be available no later than 24 hours after being taken. He also said the government and parliament will have to discuss ways to make the isolation of infected people mandatory.
France will be ready to start a vaccination campaign at the end of December or beginning of January, Macron said, starting with the most vulnerable and older people. 
The vaccine, which he called ""a glimmer of hope"", will not be mandatory, he said.
The government is treading carefully on a future vaccination programme, aware that the French, following a series of public health scandals in recent decades, have some of the lowest levels of trust in vaccines in the world. 
According to an Ipsos poll for the World Economic Forum, only 59% of French respondents said they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if it became available, compared with 67% in the United States or 85% in Britain.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised Jonathan Pollard, an American who spent 30 years in U.S. prison for spying for Israel, a warm welcome and a comfortable life in Israel now that parole restrictions have ended.
""We are waiting for you, even during the time of the coronavirus, with open arms, and you will receive the genuine embrace of the Israeli people,"" Netanyahu said in a video distributed by his office on Tuesday of part of a telephone call with Pollard and his wife Esther on Monday.
A former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst, Pollard was arrested in 1985 outside the Israeli embassy in Washington - which turned him away as he sought refuge with law enforcement closing in. Pollard was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987.
On Friday, parole restrictions imposed after Pollard's release in 2015 expired. Pollard, 66, said he and his spouse would go to Israel to live, but no date for their travel has been announced.
""You should have now a comfortable life where you can pursue, both of you can pursue, your interests and we can take care of Esther (with) the best medical treatment in the world,"" Netanyahu told Pollard, whose wife has been ill.
While in prison, the Texas-born Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship, and Israel had long pushed for his release but was spurned by several U.S. presidents.
Pollard pleaded guilty in 1986 to conspiracy to commit espionage in connection with providing Israeli contacts with hundreds of classified documents he had obtained in his naval intelligence post in exchange for thousands of dollars.
A U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ""damage assessment"", made public in 1987, said Pollard had believed U.S. intelligence support of close ally Israel was inadequate.
The U.S. Justice Department's decision not to reimpose any limits on Pollard's movements was seen by some as a parting gift by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to Israel.
""I truly want to congratulate you that your nightmare is over and you can return home, to Israel,"" Netanyahu told Pollard. ""It will truly be a big moment - a big moment for us all.""

CARACAS/PORT OF SPAIN (Reuters) - At least 29 Venezuelan migrants, including 16 minors, returned to Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday after being deported from the island over the weekend and spending hours at sea, said their relatives, who had been concerned about their whereabouts. 
Millions of Venezuelans have fled the once-prosperous OPEC nation as a humanitarian crisis intensified in recent years. Around 40,000 have settled in the neighboring dual-island nations, and dozens have gone missing since vessels they boarded in attempts to get to Trinidad sunk.
Trinidadian authorities deported the group of 29 in two small boats on Sunday, but a judge in Trinidad later ordered their return to the island. Concern about the migrants' whereabouts grew steadily on Monday when they did not arrive on eastern Venezuelan shores as expected.
Felix Marcano, a Venezuelan migrant in Trinidad whose wife and two children were among the deportees, said his relatives were hungry and dehydrated after the long journey. 
""Where were they going to get food?"" Marcano told Reuters over the phone from Trinidad, adding that his wife had attempted to come to Trinidad in search of medicine for their children, which is scarce in Venezuela. 
Yesenia Gonzalez, an activist for Venezuelan migrants in Trinidad, confirmed that the group had returned to the island. 
Trinidad and Tobago's national security minister, Stuart Young, told reporters that a group of Venezuelan migrants who had entered the country ""illegally"" were apprehended by police, handed over to the coast guard, and deported over the weekend before the court order. 
""We have been detaining people, we are deporting people, we are escorting people back across the border,"" Young said, noting that the country's borders were closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 

Trinidad's handling of the case has drawn criticism from Venezuela's opposition and migrants' rights activists.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has rescheduled the execution of Lisa Montgomery, a convicted murderer and the only woman on federal death row, to take place on Jan. 12, a few days before Joe Biden is due to be inaugurated as president of the United States.
Last week, a federal judge temporarily delayed the execution of Montgomery, which had been set for Dec. 8, to allow her two lead lawyers time to recover from COVID-19 in order to file a clemency petition asking President Donald Trump to commute the sentence to life in prison.
In his order, Judge Randolph Moss of the U.S. District Court in Washington ordered the Justice Department to not execute Montgomery before Dec. 31. The Justice Department filed a notice of the new Jan. 12 execution date with the court on Monday.
Trump's administration resumed carrying out executions earlier this year after a 17-year hiatus, although a dwindling number of state governments have continued to do so throughout.
The federal government executed eight convicted murderers this year, the most federal executions in a single year since at least the 1920s, according to a database compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center.
Montgomery would be the first women to be executed by the federal government since 1953. 
Besides that of Montgomery, Trump's administration has scheduled four other executions before the Jan. 20 inauguration following the Nov. 3 elections. 
Biden, once a supporter of capital punishment, has said he will work as president to end the federal death penalty.
Montgomery, 52, was convicted in 2007 in Missouri for strangling Bobbie Jo Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant. Montgomery butchered Stinnett to cut the fetus from her womb. The child survived.
Montgomery's lawyers say Montgomery admits her guilt but deserves clemency because she has long suffered severe mental illness, exacerbated by being gang raped by her stepfather and his friends during an abusive childhood.
Montgomery is being held at the Federal Medical Center in Carswell, Texas, a prison for inmates with mental illness. Her lawyers say that she has been dressed in a ""suicide smock"" and given only a crayon with which to write. 

""Now, despite Lisa's deteriorating mental health and a much deeper understanding of the trauma she endured, the government plans to kill her,"" Sandra Babcock, one of Montgomery's attorneys, said in a statement. ""No other woman has been executed for a similar crime, because most prosecutors have recognized that it is inevitably the product of trauma and mental illness.""

(Reuters) - State and federal officials pleaded with Americans to stay at home and redouble efforts to curtail the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday, defending unpopular public health measures as record hospitalizations pushed healthcare professionals to the brink.
""We are on fire with COVID,"" Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said on CNN after enacting new restrictions last week including retail curbs and school closures. ""We're just trying to do the right thing.""
The United States surpassed 86,000 hospitalizations for COVID-19 on Tuesday, a record, as 30 of the 50 states reported record numbers of patients this month.
That has taxed already exhausted healthcare providers as more than 1,500 coronavirus deaths and 171,000 new cases pile up daily on average.
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams asked Americans to grasp ""the severity of the moment"" and remain vigilant by wearing masks, avoiding crowds and frequently washing hands until promising vaccines and therapies can be administered. 
""We just need you, the American people, to hold on a little bit longer,"" Adams, a White House Coronavirus Task Force member, told Fox News in an interview.
Adams urged people to adjust their plans ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, which has led to the busiest U.S. air travel since the early days of the pandemic in March, with millions of people flying despite the hazards of a crowded airport. U.S. health officials last week strongly recommended that Americans avoid travel for the holiday.
Global pharmaceutical companies have reported promising trial results in the development of vaccines, which could be administered to high-priority patients in December.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government will begin distributing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN)'s newly authorized COVID-19 antibody combination therapy starting Tuesday. 
In Texas, where the western city of El Paso has been ravaged by the virus, the state said it has established a facility to treat COVID-19 patients with bamlanivimab, an experimental therapy granted emergency approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The so-called infusion wing has been provided with 1,000 doses.
But hospitals need immediate relief.
After pounding big U.S. cities in the spring, COVID-19 now has engulfed rural and small-town America. Case rates in the 12 Midwestern states are more than double that of any other region, according to the COVID Tracking Project, up more than 20 times from mid-June to mid-November. 
Many Midwestern hospitals severely lack beds, equipment and clinical staff, providers say, and are asking staffers to work longer hours and more frequent shifts.
""There's a disconnect in the community, where we're seeing people at bars and restaurants, or planning Thanksgiving dinners,"" said Dr. Kelly Cawcutt, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. As health workers, she said, ""we feel kind of dejected.""
Further south, Mississippi warned that the surge of COVID-19 admissions of the past two weeks was unsustainable.
""Stay home, stay protected and keep yourself and others well,"" the Mississippi State Department of Health said in a tweet on Tuesday. 
While many Americans have chosen to ignore the best medical advice and put their families at risk, others have scaled back Thanksgiving plans or moved their holiday meals outdoors.

Jerard Gunderway, 44, who was driving from Massachusetts to North Carolina for Thanksgiving, said his family was limiting the gathering to just to him, his wife and stepdaughter.
""Just family during this situation right now. Keep everyone safe,"" he said from a rest stop in Connecticut. ""I try to keep it low-key until we figure this all out.""

305,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",Venezuela's Guaido seeks to maintain bipartisan U.S. support amid Biden transition,"By Brian Ellsworth and Vivian Sequera
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition hopes to maintain bipartisan support from politicians in the United States as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office in January, opposition leader Juan Guaido said in an interview on Tuesday. 
The Trump administration in 2019 led an international push to recognize Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader as part of a plan to force the ouster of President Nicolas Maduro amid an economic crisis and a mass migration. 
The opposition now hopes to maintain the backing of both Republicans and Democrats as it seeks to continue pressuring Maduro, who has retained the support of Venezuela's military despite a raft of aggressive U.S. sanctions. Biden is due to take office on Jan. 20.
""Any president in the world today would want to get closer to a solution to the crisis in Venezuela,"" Guaido said in an interview in his home. ""We want to have bipartisan support. It's a challenge for us, not for the new administration ... to show a path toward a viable solution.""
Biden aides have said he does not plan to change Washington's approach toward Maduro. The United States last year created a broad sanctions program that limits Venezuela's oil exports and blocks U.S. citizens from doing business with his government.
But Biden will likely face pressure to ease some measures such as restrictions on Venezuela's gasoline imports amid crippling fuel shortages.
Maduro dismisses Guaido as a puppet of the United States and denounced the sanctions campaign as an illegal and unilateral effort to force him from power.
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The country on Dec. 6 holds a congressional election that Guaido and allied opposition leaders are boycotting, saying it is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party.
Guaido, who is the head of Congress until early January, is organizing a popular consultation to be held between Dec. 5 and Dec. 12 that will ask citizens if they want Maduro to resign, if they reject the congressional vote as fraudulent, and if they support international efforts to restore democracy. 
The consultation will be both physical and digital to ensure social distancing and to allow for participation of some 5 million Venezuelans who have emigrated to escape the crisis.
Guaido said he and other opposition legislators will not recognize the results of parliamentary vote and will consider themselves legislators under the principal of ""constitutional continuity,"" which holds that they will remain in their posts because no legitimate election is being held to replace them.
This approach has faced criticism from within the opposition that it will create a ""virtual parliament"" that competes with the congress recognized by the Socialist Party. 
Guaido in response said that virtual meetings are already routine both because of the pandemic and because many opposition legislators have been forced into exile.

""In 2020, everything is virtual,"" he said. ""And in Venezuela (this is true) for other reasons, because of the (high) costs, because of the persecution.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The four nations of the United Kingdom have agreed to relax COVID-19 restrictions for Christmas to allow up to three households to meet at home for five days.
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have taken differing approaches to handling the pandemic so far but the leaders of the devolved nations reached agreement with London on Tuesday on rules governing the festive period.
Three households will be able to form a ""Christmas bubble"", allowing them to meet up at home, places of worship and in outdoor public places but not at indoor hospitality or entertainment venues from Dec. 23 until Dec. 27 under the plans. 
""People want to be with their loved-ones and those close to them for what is the most important holiday of the year,"" senior minister Michael Gove said on Tuesday. 
Limits on travel will also be scrapped so that people can meet up, with an additional day on either side for those going to and from Northern Ireland. 
A national lockdown in England is due to end next week after which different parts of the country will face varying restrictions as part of a tiered system announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
A decision is expected later this week on which areas will fall into the different categories.
The United Kingdom has one of the highest tolls from the coronavirus pandemic, reaching 55,838 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to government data published on Tuesday. 

""The virus won’t take time off, so please be cautious,"" said Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. ""If you can, stay at home with your own household.""

LUCKNOW (Reuters) - India's ruling Hindu nationalist party approved a decree in the country's most populous state on Tuesday laying out prison terms for anyone compelling others to convert their faith or luring them into these conversions through marriage, officials said. 
The move follows a campaign by hardline Hindu groups against some interfaith marriages that they describe as ""love jihad"", Muslim men engaging in a conspiracy to turn Hindu women away from their religion by seducing them.
Critics said the unlawful conversion order approved by the cabinet of Uttar Pradesh state, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP, was aimed at further alienating India's 170 million Muslims by painting them as aggressors plotting to weaken Hindus.
Little data exists to show how many interfaith marriages took place in the state, the first in the country to bring in such legislation.
Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh said prison terms of up to five years were necessary to stop unlawful conversions and provide justice to women who have suffered from them.
Under the new law, a man and woman belonging to different religions will have to give two months' notice to the district magistrate before they get married and they will be allowed to tie the knot if there are no objections.
Hindus makes up 80 percent of India's 1.3 billion population. But hardline groups accuse political parties of appeasing minority groups such as Muslims for votes and in recent years have stepped up a campaign for a Hindu-first India.
Nusrat Jahan, a member of the national parliament from a regional group most active in the neighbouring state of West Bengal, told NDTV television news channel the decree smacked of politics - even though regional elections are at least a year away. 

""This is just another agenda before the elections. There is nothing like 'love jihad' that exists. People can make their own decisions,"" she said.

CAMBRAI, France (Reuters) - At work, Caroline Tesse, an anaesthesiologist in northern France, is helping her patients make it through the COVID-19 epidemic. In the meantime, her own life is on hold.
Tesse, 34, cannot book a Christmas break this year because it's unclear when she'll be needed at the hospital and she lives in fear that her parents -- her main childcare providers -- could get infected with the virus.
""I know very well that if my parents fall ill I would never forgive myself,"" she said at her dining room table as her daughter coloured in a picture.
While attention in the COVID-19 epidemic has been focussed on the toll from the novel coronavirus on patients, Tesse's story reveals the hidden toll on professionals and their families who have had to re-organise their lives.
On a shift at Cambrai hospital, Tesse snatches a spare few minutes to make a video call to her youngest child, 18-month-old Rose, who is at home with her husband, David, also a medical professional. 
""How are you? It's mummy,"" she said to Rose. But the conversation was interrupted when her work phone rang. ""I'm coming right now,"" she said to the colleague on the other end, before quickly wrapping up the call with her daughter. 
""See you tomorrow,"" she said, blowing kisses.
She has two other children, a six-year-old son and a daughter who is four. When she's at home, she said, she tries to leave work behind. ""I avoid having my phone when I'm with the children,"" she said.
France is now in a second COVID-19 wave, and Tesse and her colleagues are focussing on dealing with that. She said she was hoping that in February she may be able to go on a skiing holiday with the family.

""But I 'm not telling the children because I'm not at all sure,"" she said. ""Things are still up in the air, we don't know what's going to happen.""

Five people were killed and 20 wounded, some critically, in a blast that exploded at a road junction on the outskirts of the city of al Bab, north of Aleppo province, they said.
A few hours later, at least two civilians was killed and 17 wounded in a car blast in the city of Afrin, a mainly Kurdish area which Turkish forces and their Syrian allies took from the Kurdish YPG militia in 2018.
Videos posted on social media showed footage of mangled cars and extensive damage to an industrial area with fires burning. Reuters could not immediately vouch for their authenticity.
Civil defence officials said the death toll was expected to rise.
The two cities, which Turkey administers with the help of Syrian Arab rebels it backs, have in the last year been frequently hit by bombings detonated in crowded civilian areas.
Turkey and its rebel allies accuse the YPG of carrying out the blasts that have killed dozens in the mainly Arab populated towns near the border under their control, saying their goal is to make them ungovernable and sow fear among civilians.
There was no immediate comment from the YPG, which has denied previous accusations of attacks on civilians. It says it only targets Turkish soldiers and their allies in a guerrilla campaign to drive out ""occupiers"". 
The YPG says Ankara wants to drive out Kurds and settle Arabs. 
Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group tied to the PKK inside its own borders, and has staged incursions into Syria in support of Syrian rebels to push it from the Turkish frontier. 

Ankara now retains a large military presence in the area deploying thousands of troops in the last rebel enclave.

French rights activists and journalists have staged protests against the bill, which stipulates that anyone circulating a police officer's image with the intention of seeing harm done to the officer could be jailed for a year and fined 45,000 euros ($53,450) upon conviction.
Castex told parliament that the government is not targeting the freedom of the press or freedom of expression, but wants to protect police from the disseminaton of images and text aimed at harming police forces. 
""The aim is not to prevent anyone from filming or broadcasting images that shed a light on a fact or a public event,"" said Castex, who will hold talks with journalists' unions this week. 
Opponents say the bill - drafted by two MPs from President Emmanuel Macron's centrist party - would infringe journalists' freedom to report on public events, and make it harder to hold officers accountable if, for example, they use excessive violence while detaining a suspect. 
The government has already added a line to the draft law to specify that it ""does not infringe on the right to inform"".
The law was to be voted in the National Assembly, where Macron's party has a majority, later on Tuesday. Some of the party's MPs have said they will vote against the bill. 
In a nod to the opposition, Castex said the government itself would present the bill - once voted on - to the Constitutional Council to verify that it is in line with the constitution. 

Opposition parties often appeal to the council if they contest the constitutionality of a law.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 11:37AM ET</span>",‘We’re drowning’: COVID cases flood hospitals in America’s heartland,"By Nick Brown
(Reuters) - Dr. Drew Miller knew his patient had to be moved.
The vital signs of the 30-year-old COVID-19 victim were crashing, and Kearny County Hospital in rural Lakin, Kansas, just wasn’t equipped to handle the case. Miller, Kearny’s chief medical officer - who doubles as the county health officer - called around to larger hospitals in search of an ICU bed. With coronavirus cases soaring throughout Kansas, he said, he couldn't find a single one.
By the time a bed opened elsewhere the following day, the young man was near death. For a full 45 minutes, Miller and his staff performed chest compressions in a desperate attempt to save him.
Somehow, Miller said, the patient regained a pulse, and was dispatched in an ambulance to the larger facility about 25 miles away. Miller then prayed with the family, whom he knew “very well” from Lakin, a town of just a few thousand people.
“It’s truly a miracle he has survived,” Miller said.
After pounding big U.S. cities in the spring, COVID-19 now has engulfed rural and small-town America, seeming to seep into the country’s every nook and cranny. According to Reuters’ interviews with more than a dozen medical care providers and public health officials in the nation’s heartland, many hospitals are severely lacking in beds, equipment and - most critically - clinical staff, including specialists and nurses.
COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are spiking nationally. But the Midwest - encompassing a dozen states between Ohio and the Dakotas - has been especially brutalized. Reported case rates are more than double that of any other region in the United States, according to the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run data provider. From mid-June to mid-November, reported cases in the Midwest rose more than twentyfold.
For the week ending November 19, North Dakota reported an average of 1,769 daily new cases per 1 million residents, according to the tracking project. South Dakota recorded nearly 1,500 per million residents, Wisconsin and Nebraska around 1,200, and Kansas nearly 1,000. Even in New York’s worst week in April - with business closed and panic gripping the public - the state never averaged more than 500 new cases per million people. California never topped 253.
Hospital officials in the Midwest told Reuters they’re at capacity or nearly so. Most have tried to increase availability by repurposing wings or cramming multiple patients in a single room, and by asking staffers to work longer hours and more frequent shifts.
Facilities like Kearny, known as “critical access” hospitals, weren’t made for this. Often sparsely funded, they mainly provide basic or emergency care to residents who live long distances away from bigger medical centers. Now, “we have to plan on being able to care for whomever comes in,” said Miller, whose specialty is family medicine.
As cases spike in many conservative states and counties, medical workers say they often face a challenge just in convincing patients and local leaders that the disease should be taken seriously and isn’t a Democrat-perpetuated hoax.
Such viewpoints flow from the top. President Donald Trump often has held shoulder-to-shoulder rallies in the Midwest and elsewhere and treated masks as a matter of personal choice. Although Trump was not re-elected, about two months remain in his tenure, with little sign of change in his coronavirus strategy, even as the crisis grows. 
The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.
Some medical officials and hospital staffers find it hard to reconcile laissez-faire policies with the sickness and suffering they see.
“There’s a disconnect in the community, where we’re seeing people at bars and restaurants, or planning Thanksgiving dinners,” said Dr. Kelly Cawcutt, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. As health workers, she said, “we feel kind of dejected.”
All told, COVID-19 has claimed more than 256,000 lives in the United States. The virus’ mortality rate has dropped as doctors have learned more about the disease, and vaccines developed by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and others could hit the market early next year. In the meantime, smaller hospitals say they are employing the same drugs - such as remdesivir and dexamethasone - that big-city facilities do, but don’t have the same access to ICU equipment or specialized expertise.
With low temperatures sending people indoors and holiday travel underway, doctors in the region aren’t expecting relief anytime soon.
“I don’t think the worst is here yet,” Miller said.
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
Hospital leaders described demoralization among staffers struggling to reckon with overwork, grief and death.
Shortages of staff, rather than beds, are the biggest single problem in many hospitals, the health officials said. “Just because you can take a cot and put it in a room doesn’t mean you have the appropriate nursing staff to care for a patient,” said Dr. Anthony Hericks, director of critical care with Avera Health in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Nurses must observe COVID-19 patients even more closely than others, because of the potential for rapid decline, said Melisa Hazell, a critical care nurse at Hutchinson Regional Medical Center, in Hutchinson, Kansas. She said she recently recovered from COVID-19 herself, returning to work as soon as she was certain she wouldn’t spread the virus.
“I was off for 12 days,” she said. “Was I mentally and physically ready to go back to work? No, but my teammates needed me.”
Remote hospitals don’t keep a full staff on board in the best of times. They hire traveling nurses as the number of patients surge. Now it’s tough to find any available.
Aya Health, a San Diego, California-based nurse staffing agency, was posting around 14,000 open positions in the spring, said April Hansen, an executive vice president. That number has now doubled, she said, and pay rates have shot up with demand.
Mary Helland, a chief nursing officer with CommonSpirit Health in North Dakota, said she has put in requests for traveling nurses for the 11 critical access hospitals she oversees in North Dakota and Minnesota. But “bigger hospitals are using them all up,” she said.
At Hutchinson Regional, which has 190 beds, Chief Nursing Officer Amanda Hullet has begun taking floor shifts, even though she had long since graduated to a desk job.
The physical and emotional fatigue is constant, Hullet said, and even harder when the patient is a close friend or colleague.
Hullet recalled the recent deaths of local couple Bill and Judy Mason, just weeks apart, from COVID-19. Judy had taught dance in town for decades, Hullet said, and her students included some of the hospital’s employees.
Holly Thomas, 37, who is married to the couple’s grandson, said Judy was the ""glue"" that kept the family together.
Referring to COVID-19 in the Midwest, Thomas said ""we sat by idly from March to August not seeing a whole lot."" Now she hears of about two deaths a day. “My PE teacher from high school and his wife died within 12 hours of each other, too,” she said.
Hazell, the Hutchinson Regional nurse, encountered a patient who was a former bowling buddy. “He’s just fantastic,” she said. “Great heart, always willing to sit down and share a story or two.”
He’s on a ventilator now, not doing well. “Over next week or two, there’s going to be some tough decisions,” she said. 
‘FED UP’
Medical workers told Reuters that denial about the disease is frustratingly common among public officials, community members and even patients.
One patient at SSM Health in Janesville, Wisconsin, refused to believe COVID-19 was a serious threat, even as it consumed him, said Dr. Alison Schwartz, an infectious disease physician there. When he died, “the family did not want to admit this patient had died of COVID, because they didn’t believe COVID kills people,” she said.
Some Midwestern states and local jurisdictions been loath to mandate masks or social distancing. 
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, went so far as to say he would not allow municipalities to impose mask mandates.
Ricketts’ office declined to comment, but the governor said in a Nov. 13 press conference, “I’m against broad-based mandates in favor of educating people about how to use masks.”
“Masks work, but they’re just one tool,” Ricketts said, urging people to also focus on keeping their distance and avoiding large gatherings.
South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem has refused to mandate mask-wearing, and has not imposed restrictions on businesses or public gatherings, saying she would leave such matters to “individual responsibility.” In July, she hosted an Independence Day celebration with Trump at Mt. Rushmore, where the crowd was close together and many attendees were maskless.
Doctors say trying to change such behavior can feel like a hopeless task. “Everyone (is) continuing to go about their lives,” Schwartz said, but “we sort of feel like we’re drowning.”

Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. Turkish officials believe his body was dismembered and removed, while his remains have not been found.
In September a Saudi court jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years over the killing, in a trial that critics said lacked transparency. None of the defendants was named.
At Tuesday's hearing in Istanbul, only the second session of a trial which opened four months ago, the court accepted a second indictment adding six defendants to the list of 20 Saudi officials already being tried in absentia. 
The latest indictment accuses a vice consul and an attache of ""premeditated murder with monstrous intent"". The four others, also Saudi nationals, were charged with destroying, concealing or tampering with evidence.
The court heard testimony from Egyptian opposition activist Ayman Noor, a friend of Khashoggi's, before adjourning the case to March 4 and extending a process which has kept Khashoggi's killing in the public eye and further strained relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
Yasin Aktay, a member of President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party and an acquaintance of Khashoggi, said a just verdict could not have been expected from a Saudi court that was ruling on senior Saudi officials.
""The events actually transpired in Turkey. If we have a concern about justice, there is no other way than to have confidence in Turkish courts,"" he said after Tuesday's hearing.
The first indictment accused two top Saudi officials, former deputy head of Saudi Arabia's general intelligence Ahmed al-Asiri and former royal court adviser Saud al-Qahtani, of instigating murder.
It said 18 other defendants were flown to Turkey to kill Khashoggi, a prominent and well-connected journalist who had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince.
Noor said in court that Khashoggi called him about 10 days before he came to Turkey, and broke down in tears as he asked Noor to delete an interview Khashoggi had recorded with him.
""Qahtani had called him from Saudi Arabia. He threatened him with very strong language, saying he knew his children and was close to them,"" Noor said, according to Turkey's state-owned Anadolu news agency.
Qahtani, a top aide to Prince Mohammed who was sacked and was later sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury over his suspected role, has not faced trial in Saudi Arabia. He did not respond to requests for comment at the time of the Saudi trial.
The CIA and some Western countries believe Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, which Saudi officials deny.
Reporters Without Borders said it was disappointed by the court's rejection of its request to join the case as a civil party, and would continue to closely monitor the case and call for adherence to international standards.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 10:51AM ET</span>","Both sides claim gains in Ethiopia war, Tigrayans accused of massacre","ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia's state-appointed rights watchdog accused a Tigrayan youth group on Tuesday of killing hundreds of civilians as federal and local forces both claimed advances in a three-week war in the country's mountainous north. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government said enemy soldiers were surrendering as it advanced towards the regional capital, but the Tigrayans reported they were resisting and had destroyed a prestigious army division.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission published findings into a Nov. 9 attack in Mai Kadra in southwest Tigray - first reported by Amnesty International - where it said a youth group called Samri killed at least 600 people of the minority Amhara and Wolkait ethnic groups in the town.
They were beaten to death, stabbed, set on fire and strangled with ropes, the report said, though some residents protected neighbours by hiding them in homes. The commission accused local forces of colluding in the ""massacre"". [L1N2IA11G]
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was not immediately available but has previously denied involvement. 
Reuters has been unable to verify statements made by either side since phone and internet connections to Tigray are down and access to the area is strictly controlled.
Since fighting began on Nov. 4, hundreds have died, more than 41,000 refugees have fled to Sudan, and there has been widespread destruction and uprooting of people from homes.
The war has spread to Eritrea, where the Tigrayans have fired rockets, and also affected Somalia where Ethiopia has disarmed several hundred Tigrayans in a peacekeeping force fighting al Qaeda-linked militants.
Abiy's government said many Tigrayan combatants had responded to a 72-hour ultimatum to lay down arms before a threatened offensive against Mekelle city, with half a million inhabitants. The deadline expires on Wednesday.
'TRAGIC CONFLICT'
The battle-hardened TPLF, which had ruled the region of more than 5 million people, gave a different version, saying their troops were keeping federal forces at bay and scoring victories.
Their spokesman Getachew Reda said an important army unit - which he named as the 21st mechanised division - was destroyed in an assault at Raya-Wajirat led by a former commander of that unit now fighting for the TPLF. 
The prime minister's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum denied that.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael has disputed the government version that Mekelle is encircled at a roughly 50km (30 mile) distance, telling Reuters the ultimatum was a cover for government forces to regroup after defeats.
The United States - which regards Ethiopia as a powerful ally in a turbulent region - France and Britain were the latest foreign powers to call for peace. Washington backed African Union (AU) mediation efforts ""to end this tragic conflict now"", while Paris and London warned against ethnic discrimination. 
The U.N. Security Council had been due to hold informal talks on Tuesday over Tigray, but that was postponed to give AU envoys time to travel to Ethiopia, diplomats said.
Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for ending a standoff with Eritrea, has said he will not negotiate with the TPLF though he does plan to receive the AU envoys.
OFFENSIVE
His predecessor, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, criticised mediation efforts by ""well-intentioned outsiders"" that he said obscured crimes by the TPLF and overestimated their importance in Ethiopian society. 
""The key problem in the international community's approach to Ethiopia is the assumption of moral equivalence, which leads foreign governments to adopt an attitude of false balance and bothsidesism"" between the federal and Tigrayan sides, he wrote in Foreign Policy magazine.
Abiy, whose parents are from the larger Oromo and Amhara groups, denies any ethnic overtones to his offensive, saying he is pursuing criminals who ambushed federal forces.
The TPLF says he wants to subdue Tigray to amass power.
Since taking office in 2018, the prime minister has removed many Tigrayans from government and security posts and arrested some on rights abuse and corruption charges, even though he was their former military comrade and coalition partner. 
The conflict threatens to destabilise the vast nation of 115 million people from myriad ethnic groups whose struggles for greater resources and power intensified when Abiy took office.
In Geneva, the U.N. human rights chief voiced alarm over reports of tank and artillery build-ups outside Mekelle. 
""We have seen an Ethiopian colonel come out and say there will be no mercy. On the other side you have had the TPLF leadership say they are ready to die,"" said Michelle Bachelet.

""This is the kind of rhetoric that is extremely worrying and that may provoke or may lead to serious violations of international humanitarian law.""

The two bombs, hidden at the side of a road in a main bazaar in Bamiyan city, killed 12 civilians and two traffic policemen, said Zabardast Safai, the police chief of the province.
The other 45 people injured were mostly from a nearby restaurant and shops, Safai added.
Dozens of nations began pledging billions of dollars in aid for Afghanistan at the conference in Geneva on Tuesday, hoping that peace negotiations recently begun between the government and the Taliban will end nearly two decades of war.
Bamiyan has been seen as the country's safest province due to its remote location in the central mountains. The dominant local tribe, the Hazara, opposed the Taliban, mostly ethnic Pashtuns who massacred thousands of Hazara during their rule. 
The Taliban, which has been waging an insurgency against the foreign-backed Kabul administration since being toppled in late 2001, denied involvement in the bombings.
Hazaras are mostly Shi'ite Muslims. Minority Shi'ites have been repeatedly attacked by Sunni militants, especially Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan.
Nearly 6,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in the first nine months of this year as heavy fighting between government forces and Taliban insurgents rages on despite efforts to find peace, according to the United Nations.

""The sanitary protocol for the use of the ski stations has been finalised, the slopes will be open in winter,"" Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Gowin wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, a day after meeting representatives of the ski industry.

The government's main coronavirus advisory board said it was too early to contemplate the reopening of bars and restaurants or lifting limits on group sizes for the holiday season, RTL said, citing the committee's latest confidential advice.
The experts also said they would try to determine whether the Christmas school holiday would need to be extended in order to bring down the infection rate in the country, as a growing number of children were testing positive for COVID-19. 
There was no immediate comment from Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government, which has said it will decide on policy for the Christmas holidays by Dec. 8. It is expected to request updated advice from its expert committee by that time. 
Over the past week a total of 36,931 new infections were reported in the Netherlands, health authorities said on Tuesday, down 2% from the previous week.
The number of new cases in the past week mainly involved children aged 13-17 while they fell in all older age groups, the National Institute for Public Health said.
Infections had been declining much faster in previous weeks, after peaking at around 67,500 in the week through Oct. 27.
Bars and restaurants in the Netherlands have been shut since mid-October in an effort to stop the spread of the disease while groups of no more than four people are allowed to meet outdoors and the number of house guests is capped at three.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and China agreed on Tuesday to restart coronavirus-hit business travel this month and to continue talks on disputed isles in the East China Sea, in the first high-level dialogue since Japan picked a new leader in September. 
The two-day visit to Tokyo by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi comes amid growing concerns over Beijing's assertiveness in the region. Talks with Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi covered maritime tensions, trade and the pandemic response.
On Wednesday, Wang will make a courtesy call on Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has so far sought to balance Japan's deep economic reliance on China with security concerns, including Beijing's claims over the disputed isles that are controlled by Japan.
While Suga has steered clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by Japan's ally the United States, he has moved to counter its influence by deepening ties with Australia and choosing Vietnam and Indonesia for his first overseas trip.
""It's important to interact with people and talk directly with each other,"" Motegi told a news briefing after the talks.
""I hope this agreement will contribute to the revitalization of the economies of Japan and China, and promote mutual understanding,"" said Motegi. 
He was referring to schemes streamlining travel for business travellers and those residing in each country, which has been restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic.
EAST CHINA SEA
    While the maritime dispute over the East China Sea isles called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China remains unresolved, the sides have made tentative moves closer through trade agreements. 
Japan's government has complained of China's ""relentless"" intrusions in waters around the islets claimed by both nations.
Motegi called on China to take a ""forward-looking stance"", and said he would continue to communicate with China.
Wang stood by Beijing's stance.
""We will of course keep protecting our country's sovereignty,"" he said.
""Through the joint effort by both sides, we would like to make the East China Sea the sea of peace, friendship and cooperation."" said Wang, noting that the two countries plan to have working-level maritime talks next month.
Foreign ministers of Japan and China also confirmed progress has been made on establishing a hotline between their defence authorities, a Japanese foreign ministry official said.
The two countries implemented the Japan-China maritime and air communication mechanism in 2018 to avoid an accidental clash, but a military hotline, a key element of the scheme, has yet to be set up. 
During their meeting, Japan's Motegi also expressed concern over developments in Hong Kong, a politically thorny issue for Beijing, the Japanese foreign ministry official added.
    China, which is Japan's largest trading partner, this month signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with other 14 economies including U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, but the United States was not party to the deal.
    It was the first multilateral trade deal for China, the first bilateral tariff reduction arrangement between Japan and China, and the first time China, Japan and South Korea have been in a single free-trade bloc.
    Wang, who will fly to South Korea after Japan, said on Tuesday China and Japan agreed to move forward negotiations on a free trade deal between only the three countries.
Wang's visit to Japan reaffirmed their economic partnership, but it still lacked progress on the territorial dispute said Toshiya Takahashi, an associate professor of international relations at Shoin University. 

""Out of the bilateral talks, what can be called 'progress' is only the easing of business travel curbs between Japan and China,"" Takahashi said.

The law enforcement agency said it had opened an investigation as it suspected the Christian denomination was organising the activity in Moscow of its national centre and affiliates. 
Yaroslav Sivulskiy, a spokesman for the European Association of Jehovah's Witnesses, denied the centre had resumed its activity and said the group was being targeted in a campaign of persecution. 
Russia's Supreme Court ordered the Jehovah's Witnesses to disband in 2017 after labelling it extremist, and some of its adherents have since been jailed or hit with criminal charges in a crackdown. 
On Tuesday, black-clad officers used a crowbar and an axe to break down a door to gain access to one property, footage released by the Investigative Committee showed. 
The agency said it had identified a number of group organisers and followers and had taken them into custody as part of its investigation. It said in a statement that searches had been carried out in more than 20 regions. 
Some adherents have met privately in a flat in northwest Moscow from June 2019 to discuss and study religious literature relating to their faith, and have converted some Moscow residents, it said . 
Six Jehovah's Witnesses were detained in the Russian capital during the searches, Sivulskiy said.
The Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia where the Orthodox Church championed by President Vladimir Putin is dominant. 
Putin said in 2018 that he did not understand why authorities were pursuing the group and called for the matter to be analysed. 
The Kremlin declined to comment on Tuesday. 
Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian denomination known for door-to-door preaching, close Bible study, and rejection of military service and blood transfusions.

President-elect Joe Biden's victory has raised the possibility that the United States could rejoin a deal Iran reached with world powers in 2015, under which sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme.
President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, and Tehran responded by scaling down its compliance.
Biden's staff says the former vice president aims to restore the deal provided that Iran again abides by it. But diplomats and analysts have also said this was unlikely to happen overnight, as the adversaries would both want additional commitments.
Washington wants Iran to curb missile programmes which are not covered by the nuclear deal, and reduce its interventions in the Middle East. Iran has long said it will not negotiate over missiles, and no talks can begin unless Washington returns to the nuclear agreement and lifts sanctions unconditionally.
In remarks reported by state television on Tuesday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressed scepticism about the entire project of negotiating with the West.
""We once tried the path of having the sanctions lifted and negotiated several years, but this got us nowhere,"" he said.
""They interfere in regional affairs, they tell us not to intervene. And while Britain and France have nuclear missiles, they tell us not to have missiles. What does it have to do with you? You should first correct yourselves.""
Khamenei has long criticised negotiations with the West. Nevertheless, he gave his ultimate blessing to the nuclear agreement when it was reached.
COMPANIES WILL RETURN, SPOKESMAN SAYS
The U.S. sanctions restored under Trump have since hit Iran's economy hard, undermining pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani's argument that opening the country up to the world would improve the quality of life.
Government spokesman Ali Rabiei said on Tuesday that foreign companies were already preparing to return.
""Recently, contacts about opening offices and the presence of foreign companies in Iran have increased,"" Rabiei told a news conference that was streamed live on a government website.
""Certainly, with the... lifting of the oppressive sanctions and the absence of Trump, the presence of foreign companies and a willingness to invest in Iran will increase.""
A European diplomat said companies were still wary of a lack of transparency in Iran and that Biden lifting sanctions would not be enough to lure them back.

""There’s just no benefit for a major company to play around in a market with so little financial transparency. No compliance officer is going to sanction such a move.”

323,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Scottish court told evidence was flawed in Lockerbie bombing trial,"By Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - Scotland's High Court was told on Tuesday that the conviction of a Libyan man over the 1988 Lockerbie aircraft bombing, the deadliest militant attack in British history, rested on evidence that was badly flawed.
The family of now deceased Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, the only person convicted over the bombing that killed 270 people, have launched a posthumous appeal, supported by some victims' relatives who say the truth has yet to come out.
Pam Am Flight 103 was blown up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988 en route from London to New York, carrying mostly Americans on their way home for Christmas.
Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence officer, was jailed for life in 2001 after being found guilty of the murder of 243 passengers, 16 crew and 11 residents of Lockerbie.
His family's barrister, Claire Mitchell, told the court that the prosecution's evidence in the original trial was flawed to the extent that the case against Megrahi was not proven.
""No reasonable jury, properly directed, could have reached a guilty verdict"" based on the evidence, she said.
She said the prosecution case rested on evidence that the suitcase carrying the bomb contained clothing which it said was traceable to Megrahi, but the absence of any explanation as to how the case got onto the Pan Am flight was a critical issue.
Mitchell went through the evidence about the clothing in forensic detail, revisiting issues such as whether it had rained on the day it was purchased in Malta, as she argued that the prosecution had failed to prove that Megrahi was the purchaser.
Megrahi, who denied involvement, died in Libya in 2012 after being released three years earlier by the Scottish government on compassionate grounds following a diagnosis of terminal cancer.
In 2003, then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi accepted his country's responsibility for the bombing and paid compensation to the victims' families, but he did not admit personally ordering the attack. Gaddafi was killed by rebels in 2011 after being toppled by a popular uprising.
Megrahi's family and some relatives of the Scottish victims have always doubted his guilt.
In March, an independent Scottish review body ruled that Megrahi's family could launch an appeal after concluding there might have been a miscarriage of justice.
""Overturning of the verdict for the Megrahi family, and many of the families of British victims also supporting the appeal, would vindicate their belief that the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom stand accused of having lived a monumental lie for 31 years,"" the family's lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said in a statement ahead of the hearing.

The hearing is scheduled to last until Friday. The five judges will give their decision at a later date.

MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government is to propose a ""different"" Christmas and New Year under coronavirus restrictions with just six people at parties, although it hopes the ""soul and spirit"" of the festive season will still shine, El Mundo newspaper reported on Tuesday.
Governments across Europe, which accounts for a quarter of reported global infections and deaths, are trying to navigate a fine line between avoiding super-spreading the virus over the holidays while allowing families to celebrate Christmas. 
Quoting a health ministry draft document to be discussed with regional health chiefs, El Mundo said the government would recommend that office gatherings and similar celebrations in the run-up to the holidays be held on restaurant terraces or outside.
They would be limited to six people. 
Speaking at a news conference to anounce a nationwide vaccination plan that is due to kick off in January, Health Minister Salvador Illa would not confirm or deny the report.
""Nothing is set in stone, we need to find consensus about it (holiday restrictions). When it's decided we will announce the measures,"" he said, without elaborating further.
The document proposed ""planning a different Christmas without taking out the soul and spirit that makes it one of our citizen's most beloved holidays"".
The regional health chiefs could still introduce changes. Catalonia's government said last week it wanted to allow gatherings of up to 10 people for Christmas.
""We will listen (to central government proposals) but we will make our own decisions,"" Catalan government spokeswoman Meritxell Budo said on Tuesday.
Spain, which has more than 1.58 million COVID-19 cases - western Europe's second highest tally after France - and 43,131 dead - imposed a six-month state of emergency in October, giving regions legal backing to impose curfews and other restrictions.
Families of more than six people living together would still be able to party without the six-person cap, which applies to celebrations with any invited guests on Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year's Eve and on New Year's day, El Mundo said.

The start of the nighttime curfews in force in most Spanish regions would be moved to 1 a.m. from 11 p.m. on Dec. 24 and Dec. 31.

Speaking about the making of his film Midnight Sky, in which he plays a scientist in a post-apocalyptic world, Clooney told GQ magazine: ""We weren't in the middle of a pandemic when it happened, but there were still all these other elements, these elements of how much hate and anger all of us are experiencing in this moment of history, all over the world - go to Bolsonaro in Brazil, or Orban in Hungary.""

Orban, who has been in power for more than a decade, has built a self-styled illiberal regime, with a centralised state, a loyal business elite and an ever more nationalistic government ideology.
Criticised for years by European Union peers for eroding the rule of law and civil liberties in Hungary, Orban and his Polish allies are fighting against new EU rules enforcing democratic standards.
Asked by state television to comment on Clooney's remarks, government spokesman Ors Farkas said the actor voiced the pro-immigration message of Hungarian-born U.S. liberal billionaire George Soros, a promoter of open societies and a long-time Orban opponent.
Clooney's words were ""foolish,"" foreign affairs spokesman Tamas Menczer wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""George Clooney is a good actor so deserves respect, but... nobody should treat him like a global political oracle,"" Menczer told pro-Orban news channel HirTV late on Monday. ""He has people whispering in his ears.""
Reuters could not reach Clooney for comment. 
Through an agent, the actor released a statement to Hungarian news website Telex.hu late on Monday saying ""the Orban propaganda machine is lying, full stop,"" adding he had met George Soros only once.
""I would be ashamed if I were not on record for speaking out against the kind of authoritarianism (typical of) the Orban regime,"" Clooney said in the statement.

""I was (in Hungary) in the early 2000's and walked the boardwalk of the Danube. At that point Hungary was a shining example of democratic success... I look forward to the day that Hungary embraces what it once was.""

In a written opinion late last week, a U.N. panel of human rights experts concluded that the repeated arrest of Ghosn was ""fundamentally unfair"" and ""appears to be an abuse of process intended to ensure that he remained in custody"".
""It's hugely disappointing that the opinion piece was published based on factual errors, relying only on the one-sided claims made by Ghosn and his legal team without an understanding of how our legal system works,"" Japanese Justice Minister Yoko Kawakami said at a news briefing on Tuesday. 
""The Japanese government has filed a complaint,"" she added, saying the government would be working with the United Nations to ""correct their misunderstandings.""
The U.N. panel also urged the Japanese government to ""remedy the situation of Mr. Ghosn without delay"". 
Ghosn was charged with pocketing Nissan's funds for himself and hiding his income in late 2018. He was under house arrest awaiting trial when he fled to Lebanon about a year later, in December 2019. 
Ghosn's detention and escape to Lebanon threw Japan's legal system into the international spotlight, with critics viewing its judicial practices as overly harsh. 
In what has been called ""hostage justice"" by critics, the Japanese legal systems allow detainees to be interrogated without a lawyer present, and prisoners held in custody are often refused bail if they deny charges. 

Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing and says that he would have not received a fair trial in Japan. He has also claimed that he was a victim of a boardroom coup - a claim that Nissan Motor Co. has denied and called baseless.

Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahceli's attack on government critics came after Erdogan vowed earlier this month a new era of judicial reforms, after years of growing criticism from opponents at home and allies abroad.
The MHP has attracted criticism from opposition parties in recent days while several newspaper reports have suggested there were problems in their alliance with Erdogan's AK Party (AKP).
In a speech to MHP lawmakers in parliament, Bahceli said ""cowards, plotters and swindlers"" were targeting the so-called People's Alliance between his party and the AKP.
""The People's Alliance is Turkey's only hope, its only guarantee against the world,"" he said. ""Our relationship with our president is so consistent, balanced, uncalculating, unplanned, principled, and based on mutual respect that enemy heads cannot understand.""
Bahceli also described as a ""terror lover"" a former top government figure who called last week for the release of two high-profile prisoners charged separately after a failed coup in 2016: a Kurdish political leader and a philanthropist.
Former deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc had called for the release of the two, Selahattin Demirtas and Osman Kavala, after Erdogan last week promised judicial reforms would come in the new year. 
The comments by Arinc - a member of the Presidency's High Advisory Board - had raised expectations that Erdogan's AKP was intent on burnishing its approach to the rule of law, which opposition parties and Western allies say is influenced by politics. 
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden is also expected to toughen bilateral ties with Turkey. 

But Bahceli on Tuesday slammed the comments by Arinc, after Erdogan himself dismissed them on Sunday.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",First African-American cardinal seeks common ground with Biden administration,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, D.C. who this week will become the first African-American cardinal, said on Tuesday he wanted to find common ground with the incoming U.S. administration despite disagreements on some issues.
Gregory, who clashed with President Donald Trump earlier this year, is one of the 13 Roman Catholic Church prelates whom Pope Francis will raise to the rank of cardinal on Saturday.
The American Church is divided over many issues, including abortion. Conservative Catholics have criticised Joe Biden, who will become the first Catholic president since John F. Kennedy in 1961, for his support of abortion rights.
""I have always seen myself as someone who is charged with being in dialogue and in conversation, so I hope that my conversation with the new administration reflects that, knowing full well that there are areas about which we disagree, but also searching for those areas where we can find common ground,"" Gregory said.
Some U.S. conservative bishops say Biden, who attends Mass regularly, should be denied the sacrament of communion. Biden says he is personally opposed to abortion but cannot impose the view on others.
Last week, the head of the U.S. bishops' conference said Biden's position on abortion rights created a ""difficult and complex situation"" and announced the formation of a working group to study its ramifications.
Gregory, 72, viewed as a moderate, spoke to Reuters from a guest house in the Vatican where he has placed himself in quarantine ahead of the ceremony with the pope.
BRIDGE DIFFERENCES
He said he wanted to work with the incoming U.S. administration to look for ""where we can find things that we can do together for the betterment of the American community, for the people of the archdiocese in general. I want to be one who engages people in conversation.""
In June, Gregory criticised Trump's visit to a Washington shrine honouring Pope John Paul II, a day after police and armed soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear protesters so Trump could be photographed in front of a historic Washington church holding a Bible.
  At the time, Gregory said he found it ""baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated"".
Asked about that statement, Gregory said Catholic institutions, such as parishes, schools, hospitals, and social justice and service activities, should be models to others.
""We have to be models of how we can invite people to bridge the differences that divide us and seek the areas where we are on the same page,"" Gregory said.
""Our institutions must reflect the truth of the gospel, which is an invitation for unity and harmony rather than be used in the divisive way,"" he said.
An outspoken civil rights advocate, Gregory has addressed the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes in May.

Gregory said he hoped to be able to use his new title to be a bridge builder between the African-American Catholic community and the worldwide Church and would be ""inviting all of us to engage in a more fruitful dialogue on racial and social justice issues.""

Harry Dunn's family have said Anne Sacoolas was driving on the wrong side of the road when she crashed with the teenager, who was riding a motor-bike, near an air force base in central England which is used by the U.S. military.
Sacoolas left Britain shortly after the accident. Her lawyer has said that she will not return voluntarily to potentially face jail for ""a terrible but unintentional accident"".
She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December but an extradition request was denied the following month.
Dunn's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn challenged British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police in London's High Court over the determination that Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity at the time of his death.
They also alleged that the Foreign Office unlawfully confirmed or advised the relevant police force that Sacoolas had immunity from criminal jurisdiction. 
The court ruled on Tuesday that Sacoolas did have immunity, that it had not been expressively waived, and also that any advice given was correct.
""They may have won round one but we have got many rounds to go and a lot of fight still in us,"" Charles told Sky News, saying she would never give up and they had an appeal under way against the decision. 
""We've also got (U.S. President-elect Joe) Biden coming into power, we can hope that him and his team will show us that the U.S. do have a better side to them.""
Raab said the verdict showed his department had acted lawfully throughout.
""I appreciate that won’t provide any solace to the family in their search for justice,"" he said. ""We stand with them, we’re clear that Anne Sacoolas needs to face justice in the UK, and we will support the family with their legal claim in the U.S.""

During the lead up to the quadrennial international donors conference, diplomats reckoned Afghanistan could receive 15-20% less funding than the roughly $15.2 billion pledged at the last conference in Brussels in 2016 due to uncertainties over the peace process and difficulties getting commitments during the coronavirus pandemic.
""Despite our suffering, I want to be very clear that our commitment to negotiations with the Taliban remains firm...we must bring an end to the violence that is haunting our lives and robbing our children of the joys of childhood,"" Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said, joining the virtual conference in a video link from Kabul.
Also addressing the conference, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a ceasefire as soon as possible, with violence escalating while peace negotiators have have struggled to make progress since talks began in Qatar in September.
Keeping financing on a tight rein could provide foreign governments with some leverage to inject a greater sense of urgency into the peace process, diplomats said. 
Uncertainty whether the compromises needed for peace might lead to backsliding on human and women's rights, has made some countries wary about making long-term commitments to an Afghan administration, which needs foreign money to cover about three-quarters of its spending. 
Also, most governments are under intense pressure to make savings as they ramp up spending to help their own economies recover from impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and diplomats said.
The European Union pledged 1.2 billion euros ($1.43 billion)over four years but emphasised aid was conditional on strict requirements. 
""Afghanistan's future trajectory must preserve the democratic and human rights gains since 2001, most notably as regards to women and children's rights,"" said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.
""Any attempt to restore an Islamic emirate would have an impact on our political and financial engagement,"" he added, referring to the Taliban's previous rule between 1996 and 2001.
Britain, one of the country's top bilateral donors, said in a statement it would pledge $227 million in annual civilian and food aid.
Finland and the United Nations, who are organising the conference with the Afghan government, urged the international community not to abandon their commitments to the country as the United States withdraws troops.
""(Afghans) will need the ongoing support of the international community: political, financial, and technical. Now is not the time to walk away,"" said Deborah Lyons, head of the UN's mission to Afghanistan.

Nursing homes were ravaged by the initial wave of the coronavirus, prompting Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's sombre admission in May that the country failed to protect its elderly.
Known for its rejection of lockdowns and masks, Sweden has suffered many times more COVID-19 deaths per capita than its neighbours - though fewer than countries such as Spain - a failure authorities have in part blamed on inadequate controls and care at nursing homes. 
The Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO), a government agency supervising healthcare and social services, has spent months investigating care at nursing homes after a flood of complaints from relatives and staff.
""In its investigation, IVO has identified serious short-comings at regional level when it comes to the care provided to people living in nursing homes,"" Sofia Wallstrom, the watchdog's director general, told a news conference presenting its findings.
The watchdog said none of Sweden's 21 regions had taken sufficient responsibility for the treatment of infected nursing home residents, with a fifth of patients having received no individual assessment by doctors. 
The probe did not single out individual facilities or staff.
After a lull during the summer, cases have shot up again at elderly care facilities during a second wave of the pandemic, raising fears of a repeat of the deadly spring. Nursing home residents account for nearly half of Sweden's more than 6,400 deaths among COVID-19 patients.
The watchdog urged regional authorities to carry out measures to improve care and present them no later than Jan. 15 next year and said it would be carrying out a further review of patient records.
""The lowest level (of care) is quite simply too low,"" Wallstrom said. ""Even during a pandemic.""

In a new book ""Let Us Dream: The Path to A Better Future,"" Pope Francis said: ""I think often of persecuted peoples: the Rohingya, the poor Uighurs, the Yazidi.""
It was the first time he had called China's Uighurs a persecuted people, something human rights activists have been urging him to do for years.
Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian rejected his characterisation of the Uighurs.
""The Chinese government has always protected the legal rights of ethnic minorities equally,"" he told a media briefing.
People of all ethnicities in Xinjiang enjoy full protection of their subsistence rights, developmental rights and religious freedom, Zhao said.
""The remarks by Pope Francis are groundless,"" he said.
​ While the pope has spoken out before about the Rohingya who have fled Myanmar and the killing of Yazidi by Islamic State in Iraq, it was the first time he mentioned the Uighurs.
Faith leaders, activist groups and governments have said crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place against Uighurs in China's Xinjiang region, where more than 1 million people are held in camps.
Beijing has rejected the allegations as a attempt to discredit China, saying the camps are vocational education and training centres as part of counter-terrorism and deradicalisation measures.
Many commentators have said the Vatican was reluctant to speak out on the Uighurs earlier because it was in the process of renewing an accord with Beijing on the appointment of bishops. It was renewed in September.

KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Tuesday vowed to defend the democratic island's sovereignty with the construction of a new fleet of domestically-developed submarines, a key project supported by the United States to counter neighbouring China.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has been for years working to revamp its submarine force, some of which date back to World War Two, and is no match for China's fleet, which includes vessels capable of launching nuclear weapons.
At a ceremony to mark the start of construction of a new submarine fleet in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, Tsai called the move a ""historic milestone"" for Taiwan's defensive capabilities after overcoming ""various challenges and doubts"".
""The construction demonstrates Taiwan's strong will to the world to protect its sovereignty,"" she told the event, which was also attended by the de facto U.S. ambassador in Taiwan, Brent Christensen.
""Submarines are important equipment for the development of Taiwan's navy's asymmetric warfare capabilities and to deter enemy ships from encircling Taiwan.""
The U.S. government in 2018 gave the green light for U.S. manufacturers to participate in the programme, a move widely seen as helping Taiwan secure major components, though it is unclear which U.S. companies are involved.
State-backed CSBC Corporation Taiwan said it would deliver the first of the eight planned submarines in 2025, giving a major boost to Tsai's military modernisation and self-sufficiency plan.
Company chairman Cheng Wen-lung said they had faced major challenges, including difficulty procuring parts as well as ""external forces hindering the development of this programme"".
Taiwan's armed forces are mostly equipped by the United States, but Tsai has made development of an advanced home-grown defence industry a priority.
In June, Tsai oversaw the first public test flight of a new locally designed and made advanced jet trainer.

Chinese forces have ramped up their military activities near Taiwan, on occasion flying fighter jets across the unofficial buffer median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait.

The official investigation into the deadliest peacetime shipwreck in European waters of modern times reached the conclusion in 1997 that the bow ramp of the ferry had failed during a storm, flooding the car deck and causing the vessel to sink.
A Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Network documentary in September has prompted some survivors and relatives of victims to demand a new investigation. The film included underwater video images from the wreck site, showing previously undisclosed damage to the starboard side of the ferry.
""A request has been submitted to the Prosecution Authority that the preliminary investigation from the 1990s on Estonia's sinking should be reopened as new circumstances have appeared,"" Swedish prosecutors said in a statement. 
The statement quoted Prosecutor Karolina Wieslander as saying the request referred to ""information in the recently aired TV documentary"".
Estonia, a roll-on roll-off ferry, carried 803 passengers and 186 crew when it sank on a stormy Baltic Sea shortly after midnight on Sept. 28, 1994.

(Reuters) - David Dinkins, who served as New York City's first and only African American mayor during the 1990s, died on Monday at the age of 93, police said.
His death appeared to be of natural causes, Detective Adam Navarro of the city's police department told Reuters.
Born in 1927 in Trenton, New Jersey, Dinkins attended Howard University and Brooklyn Law School.
He eventually came to Harlem, the historically Black neighborhood in upper Manhattan, where he rose in the ranks of local politics.
""For decades, Mayor Dinkins lead with compassion and an unparalleled commitment to our communities,"" state attorney general Letitia James said in a statement. ""New York will mourn Mayor Dinkins and continue to be moved by his towering legacy."" 
In Harlem, Dinkins formed part of a group of Black power brokers, known as the ""Gang of Four,"" that included Congressman Charles Rangel, Percy Sutton and Basil Paterson, the father of future New York Governor David Paterson.
Dinkins defeated the three-term incumbent Democrat Mayor Ed Koch and Republican prosecutor Rudy Giuliani in the 1989 mayoral race.
Giuliani, who would come back to defeat Dinkins four years later, was among the first to pay tributes.
""I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mayor David Dinkins, and to the many New Yorkers who loved and supported him,"" Giuliani said on Twitter. ""He gave a great deal of his life in service to our great City.""
New York, during Dinkins' term, was battling high crime, a fierce economic recession and the AIDS epidemic.
But it was his role in the 1991 Crown Heights riot that would most define his mayoralty.
The riot was sparked in the racially divided Brooklyn neighborhood by the acquittal of a young black man, Lemrick Nelson, in the killing of Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Jewish student. 
Speaking in 2011, Dinkins remembered his handling of the riot as one of his chief regrets.
""The thing that hurt the most, I suppose, was to be accused by some of permitting — holding the police back — and permitting young blacks to attack Jews,"" Dinkins said, according to the New York Times. 

""And this was untrue, inaccurate and not so, and that’s kind of painful. But if I had it to do over again, I would have said maybe 24 hours earlier to the police, ‘What you’re doing isn’t working,’ which I finally said.""

The milestone was achieved by lifting 93 million people out of poverty since 2013, China's government said. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press briefing on Tuesday that China was prepared to share its experience with other developing countries.
China sets its own national standard of extreme poverty, based on a per capita income threshold of 4,000 yuan per year, or around $1.52 per day, and other factors such as access to basic healthcare and education. That compares with a threshold of $1.90 per day set by the World Bank to measure extreme poverty globally.
On Monday afternoon, officials in one of China's poorest provinces, Guizhou, announced that the last nine remaining counties had been removed from the nation's list of poor regions. The list, drawn up in 2014, initially identified 832 counties as extremely poor.
Guizhou said average per capita annual income in the counties had risen to 11,487 yuan. State media said third-party auditors had visited the nine counties to conduct final surveys this month.
Guizhou was the last province to report its latest surveys, after other provinces and regions including Xinjiang, Guangxi, Ningxia Yunnan, Sichuan and Gansu removed their final counties from the list earlier this month. ($1 = 6.5820 Chinese yuan renminbi)

Bahrain followed the United Arab Emirates in normalising ties with Israel in a deal brokered by the United States that marked a strategic Middle East alignment against Iran. The shift has enraged the Palestinians who have demanded statehood before any such regional rapprochement. 
""We are both excited to bring the fruits of peace to our people and countries in such a short time. That's why he (al-Khalifa) invited me to come soon for a formal visit in Bahrain and I will do this happily,"" Netanyahu said in a statement about a phone call he held with the crown prince. 
A first Bahraini delegation visited Israel last Wednesday.
On Monday, an Israeli official and local media said Netanyahu had secretly traveled to Saudi Arabia on Sunday for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in what would be the first publicly confirmed visit there by an Israeli leader.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud denied such talks took place. Netanyahu did not confirm or deny the reports. 
Since September, the Trump administration has brokered agreements with Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Sudan toward normalising their relations with Israel. An Israeli delegation traveled to Sudan on Monday. 
Although White House officials have said more countries are considering normalising ties with Israel, further developments appear unlikely before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20 and establishes his administration's policy on Iran.

The federal government denied that and said many Tigrayan soldiers were surrendering in line with a 72-hour ultimatum before a threatened attack on the regional capital Mekelle.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's troops launched an offensive against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) local government on Nov. 4 and say they are closing in on Mekelle in a final push to win the conflict.
But the battle-hardened TPLF say their troops are keeping the federal army at bay and scoring some big victories.
Their spokesman Getachew Reda told Tigray TV a prestigious army unit - which he termed the 21st mechanised division - had been ""completely destroyed"" in an assault at Raya-Wahirat led by a former commander of that unit now fighting for the TPLF. 
Billene Seyoum, the prime minister's spokeswoman, told Reuters that was not true.
Reuters has been unable to verify statements made by either side since phone and internet connections to Tigray are down and access to the area is strictly controlled.
Hundreds have died, tens of thousands of refugees have fled to Sudan and there is widespread destruction and uprooting of people from homes, security and aid sources say. 
The conflict has spread to Eritrea, where the TPLF has fired rockets, and also affected Somalia where Ethiopia has disarmed several hundred Tigrayans in a peacekeeping force fighting al Qaeda-linked militants.
'TRAGIC CONFLICT'
The United States, which regards Ethiopia as a powerful ally in a turbulent region, became the latest nation to call for peace, saying it supported African Union (AU) mediation efforts ""to end this tragic conflict now.""
Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for ending a standoff with Eritrea, has said he will not negotiate with the TPLF though he does plan to receive AU envoys.
He has given Tigrayan forces until Wednesday to surrender or face an assault on the highland city of Mekelle, home to about half a million people. 
A government taskforce said large numbers of Tigrayan militia and special forces had surrendered and it asked others still with the TPLF to disarm wherever they were.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael has disputed the government version that Mekelle is encircled at a roughly 50km (31 mile) distance and told Reuters the ultimatum, which ends on Wednesday, was a cover for government forces to regroup after defeats.
The U.S. embassy in Eritrea's capital Asmara, where TPLF rockets have fallen near the airport, issued an alert saying it had reports that neighbourhood wardens advised residents to remain indoors at the instruction of local officials. 
""All U.S. Citizens in Asmara are advised to continue to exercise caution, remain in their homes, and conduct only essential travel until further notice,"" the embassy said.
France also expressed concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, condemned ""ethnic violence"" and called for protection of civilians. 
Abiy, whose parents are from the larger Oromo and Amhara groups, denies any ethnic overtones to his offensive against the TPLF, saying he is pursuing criminals who have revolted against the federal government and ambushed a military base.
The TPLF says he wants to subdue Tigray to amass more personal power. Since taking office in 2018, the prime minister has removed many Tigrayans from positions in government and the security forces and arrested some on charges of corruption and human rights abuses, even though he was their former military comrade and coalition partner.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said on Tuesday that the best case scenario for the 2020 Olympics postponed until next year is to have venues full of spectators, as organisers wrestle with how to plan for the Games amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
With COVID-19 infections on the rise in many countries around the world, Olympics organisers have yet to decide whether to allow spectators into venues next year and if so, how many.
Koike, speaking at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, said organisers were still hopeful venues could be filled with spectators when the Olympics begin in July.
""The best-case scenario ... would be when all athletes from all countries come here in safety and with peace of mind and the Olympics can, as in previous years, be held with full spectators present as well,"" said Koike.
Organisers have said previously they will not make a decision on spectator numbers until the spring.
Although Japan has largely avoided the huge numbers of COVID-19 infections seen in other countries, daily cases in Tokyo rose to records above 500 last week.
Koike warned that Tokyo was seeing a rise in infections among older residents, including cases where people had contracted the virus while eating out and brought it home to elderly relatives. 
She is due to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga later on Tuesday to discuss a domestic travel promotion campaign introduced by the government earlier this year to try to stimulate local economies hit by the near-complete absence of foreign tourism amid the pandemic.
""It is clear that the movement of people is having an impact on the increase in cases,"" Koike said. ""It is necessary to look at what kind of restrictions on the movement of people might be needed.""
The Japanese government is preparing to pause the travel campaign in Osaka and Sapporo following sharp rises in COVID-19 cases, the minister handling the government's coronavirus response said on Tuesday.

Biden's victory on Nov. 3 is awkward for Warsaw's right-wing conservative government, which set great store by its relationship with Trump, securing a pledge of a permanent U.S. military deployment, while straining the tolerance of Brussels and European Union allies over its handling of democratic values.
After weeks of fruitless legal campaigns, President Donald Trump's administration on Monday cleared the way for Biden to transition to the White House, giving him access to briefings and funding, while vowing to continue fighting the result.
Poland's president has congratulated Biden on a successful campaign, but Warsaw has not officially recognised him as the next U.S. president.
Asked when he would do so, Rau noted that the Electoral College, which formally elects the president, did not meet until Dec. 14, and that legal challenges could continue until the inauguration on Jan. 20.
""It depends on the political and legal developments in the United States itself,"" he told public radio.

During the election campaign, Biden accused Trump of backing authoritarian leaders around the world, citing Poland among others.

Claimed by China but democratically ruled, Taiwan enjoyed unprecedented backing from Republican Trump's administration, including stepped-up arms sales and visits by top officials to Taipei.
The election of Biden, a Democrat, has caused some unease in Taiwan, where Trump remains a popular figure amongst the public.
Still, Taiwan has sought to underscore its confidence in ties, noting bipartisan support for the island in Washington. This month, Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Washington spoke to longtime Biden confidant Antony Blinken, now tapped as the next secretary of state.
Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said the island had good contacts with both the Democratic and Republican parties.
""The foreign ministry and our representative office in the United States have continued to maintain smooth communication and have good interactions with the Biden team via various appropriate means,"" she said.
""At the same time, we have also conveyed Taiwan's sincere gratitude to the current Trump administration. The current Taiwan-U.S. relationship is at its best in history. We sincerely thank you.""
Taiwan will continue to play the role of a close and reliable partner to the United States, whether in regional or global issues, Ou added.

The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is its strongest backer on the international stage and major source of arms, to China's anger, becoming another major irritant in Sino-U.S. ties.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai police will deploy nearly 6,000 officers on Wednesday for a demonstration at the office that manages the royal fortune by protesters demanding that King Maha Vajiralongkorn give up personal control of the assets.
Police said on Tuesday that no protesters would be allowed within 150 metres (450 feet) of the Crown Property Bureau, where royalists have also said they plan to gather in defence of a monarchy that faces its biggest challenge in decades.
Piya Tavichai, the deputy head of Bangkok police, said the two groups would be kept apart.
""Depending on how protesters behave, we will take appropriate measures,"" he told a news conference.
More than 50 people were hurt last week when police used water cannon and teargas against thousands of protesters at parliament in the most violent day of more than four months of demonstrations.
Protesters seek the removal of former junta leader and now Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and want a new constitution, but have also broken taboos by demanding reforms to curb the powers of the king.
Among protesters' demands is the reversal of changes that gave the king personal control over a royal fortune valued in the tens of billions of dollars.
The FreeYouth protest group said in a Twitter post that they would demonstrate on Wednesday to ""reclaim the property that is meant to belong to the people"".
The Royal Palace has made no comment since the protests began, although the king said the protesters were loved ""all the same"" when asked for comment on the demonstrations.

Prayuth has rejected protesters' calls to resign and said last week that all laws would be used against protesters who break them - raising concerns among activists that this includes royal insult laws which have not been used since 2018.

People posted photos and videos on social media of police hitting demonstrators as they moved in to clear the square of migrants' tents, which the police said had been set up without official permission.
""Some of the images of the dispersion of the illegal migrant camp at Place de la Republique are shocking,"" Darmanin wrote on Twitter in the early hours of Tuesday, adding that he was seeking a full report into the incident.
The migrant camp at Place de la Republique emerged just a week after police had cleared out a bigger, illegal migrant campsite near the French national sports stadium.
France has joined other European states, such as Italy and Britain, in taking a tougher stance on migrants since the outbreak of the Syria conflict in 2011 triggered a migrant crisis across Europe.

Opinion polls show voters are worried about the issue of migration, which in turn has driven support for far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who is likely to be President Emmanuel Macron's main opponent in the next presidential election in 2022.

During a trip to Manila on Monday, national security adviser Robert O'Brien underscored the U.S. commitment to Taiwan and told the Philippines and Vietnam, countries both locked in maritime rows with China, that ""we've got your back"".
""It shows that his visit to this region is not to promote regional peace and stability, but to create chaos in the region in order to seek selfish interests of the U.S.,"" the embassy said in a statement issued late Monday. 
The United States should ""stop inciting confrontation"" in the South China Sea and ""stop making irresponsible remarks on the Taiwan and Hong Kong issue, which are purely China's internal affairs"", the statement said. 
O'Brien has warned China it would face a ""backlash"" if it attempted to use military force to coerce Taiwan, which China views as one of its provinces with no right to state-to-state ties.
The United States and China have been at loggerheads over issues from technology and human rights to Chinese maritime militarisation, with each accusing the other of deliberately provocative behaviour.
China claim to 90% of the South China Sea includes areas claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. An international tribunal in 2016 ruled that China's expansive claim, based on its historical maps, is inconsistent with international law. 
The United States has repeatedly sent warships to the strategic waterway to demonstrate freedom of navigation there.
""Facts have proved that the U.S. is the biggest driver of the militarization,"" the embassy statement said, calling it ""the most dangerous external factor"" in the South China Sea. 

The United States embassy in Manila had no immediate response.

Millions of Venezuelans have fled an economic collapse in their homeland in recent years, with around 40,000 settling in the neighboring dual-island nation. More than a dozen Venezuelans have been missing since vessels they boarded in attempts to get to Trinidad sunk.
""The IACHR urges Trinidad and Tobago to strictly observe the duty of special protection of (children and adolescent) migrants and to consider their best interests in all decisions that affect them,"" the IACHR, a body of the Washington-based Organization of American States (OAS), wrote on Twitter, adding that some of the minors were unaccompanied by their parents.
Neither Venezuela's information ministry nor Trinidad and Tobago's foreign ministry immediately responded to requests from Reuters for comment.
David Smolansky, an exiled Venezuelan opposition leader who coordinates the OAS's response to the once-prosperous OPEC nation's migration crisis, said the minors as well as 13 adults were deported on Sunday afternoon on two small boats destined for Venezuela.
Concern for the deportees grew on Monday when the boat did not arrive in eastern Venezuela as expected around midday, Smolansky said.

Shares in the Brazilian chain, the local unit of France's Carrefour, were the biggest losers on Brazil's Bovespa benchmark stock exchange index, which was up about 1% overall in afternoon trading. 
A Carrefour Brasil spokesman declined to immediately comment on the fall in share price.
Some protesters have called for a boycott of the chain after a graphic video circulated on social media showing two security guards punching and pinning to the ground 40-year-old João Alberto Silveira Freitas on Thursday night. The two guards have been arrested.
The killing sparked Black Lives Matter protests in major Brazilian cities on Friday, with more than 1,000 demonstrators gathering at the store in the city of Porto Alegre where the incident took place. Some of the protesters rioted, destroying windows and vehicles, and setting fires.
Carrefour's global chairman and CEO Alexandre Bompard said late on Friday that the images of the beating were ""unbearable"" and he condemned racism and violence.
Carrefour Brasil said that it was taking steps to ensure those responsible were legally punished and that it would terminate its contract with the firm that provided security at the store. 

Another protest was planned for Monday evening in Porto Alegre, organized by local Black activists, Black city council members and the third-tier São José soccer club, which Silveira Freitas supported.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will keep pressing China to improve its human rights record but has no interest in irresponsible tough talk, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said on Monday.
Bilateral ties between the two nations effectively froze in December 2018 when Canadian police picked up a senior Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive on a U.S. arrest warrant.
China subsequently detained two Canadian citizens and blocked lucrative imports of canola seed.
The minority Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under pressure from the official opposition Conservatives to crack down by banning Huawei from supplying equipment to 5G telecoms networks and stop what it calls Chinese interference in Canada's internal affairs.
""To those who are seduced by this one-dimensional view I say this: while it is easy to be tough, let's continue to be smart,"" Champagne said, noting China's economic power and its central role in fighting climate change.
""Let's not fall into the temptation of tough and irresponsible rhetoric that will generate no tangible results"" for the detainees, Canadian farmers, the business community and human rights advocates, he told a special parliamentary committee on Canada-China relations.
Canada would continue working with allies to pressure China over the detention of foreign citizens as well as its clamp down in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang region, Champagne said.
In July, Canada became the first nation to suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in the wake of new Chinese national security legislation. Earlier this month it promised to make it easier for Hong Kong youth to study and work in Canada.

""It is absolutely imperative that advanced democracies like Canada and our like-minded partners work together to protect the international rules that have ensured stability and prosperity for decades,"" Champagne said. ""It is a challenge we all share. No country will succeed alone.""

The feast day of the Virgin of Guadalupe celebrated on Dec. 12 typically features lavish pageantry at her namesake basilica in the north of Mexico City where throngs of pilgrims arrive on their knees in prayer.
But this year the festivities will move online, according to a statement issued by the bishops' conference and city government.
""The health conditions the country is experiencing due to COVID-19 do not permit us at this time to celebrate the Virgin of Guadalupe together at her sanctuary,"" the statement said.
The closure will run from Dec. 10 through Dec. 13, and a security perimeter will be erected to ensure compliance.
The basilica is the most visited Catholic shrine of the Americas and was built next to a hill where legend holds that Jesus's mother, Mary, appeared to an Aztec man in the 1531 just a decade after the Spanish conquest of Mexico.
The authorities said that while millions would like to attend the celebration ""in search of comfort in the face of anguish, despair and helplessness... the common good motivates us to take containment measures to avoid further spread of the virus.""

Since the pandemic reached Mexico in the spring, most in-person religious gatherings, including Catholic Masses, have been pared back or simply canceled and replaced with online services.

Britain, which ruled Hong Kong for over 150 years until it handed it back to China in 1997, says a new security law imposed on the territory by Beijing in July was a breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that paved the way for the handover.
London has also objected to new rules imposed by mainland China to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong, and to what it describes as retribution by the territory's executive against political opposition and silencing of dissent.
""This has been, and continues to be, the most concerning period in Hong Kong’s post-handover history,"" Raab wrote in his foreword to the latest in a regular series of six-monthly reports on Hong Kong. 
China has rejected all of Britain's criticisms and accused it of seeking to meddle in internal Chinese affairs.
In the foreword, Raab said he had begun consulting on what to do about British judges who currently sit on Hong Kong's top court.
""I have begun consultations with Lord Reed, President of the UK Supreme Court, concerning when to review whether it continues to be appropriate for British judges to sit as non-permanent judges on the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal,"" Raab said.
Britain had already announced new immigration rules making it easier for people from Hong Kong to live in the United Kingdom, suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and extended its China arms embargo to include Hong Kong.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - In a new book, Pope Francis for the first time calls China's Muslim Uighurs a ""persecuted"" people, something human rights activists have been urging him to do for years.
In the wide-ranging ""Let Us Dream: The Path to A Better Future,"" Francis also says the COVID-19 pandemic should spur governments to consider permanently establishing a universal basic income.
In the book, a 150-page collaboration with his English-language biographer, Austen Ivereigh, Francis speaks of economic, social and political changes he says are needed to address inequalities after the pandemic ends. It goes on sale on Dec. 1.
He also says people who see wearing masks as an imposition by the state are ""victims only in their imagination"" and praises those who protested against the death of George Floyd in police custody for rallying around the ""healthy indignation"" that united them.
""I think often of persecuted peoples: the Rohingya, the poor Uighurs, the Yazidi,"" he said in a section where he also talks about persecuted Christians in Islamic countries.
While the pope has spoken out before about the Rohingya who have fled Myanmar, and the killing of Yazidi by Islamic State in Iraq, it was the first time he mentioned the Uighurs.
Faith leaders, activist groups and governments have said crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place against Uighurs in China’s remote Xinjiang region, where more than 1 million people are held in camps.
Last month, during a conference at the Vatican, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted China over its treatment of Uighurs.
Beijing has rejected the allegations as a attempt to discredit China, saying the camps are vocational education and training centres as part of counter-terrorism and deradicalisation measures.
Many commentators have said the Vatican was reluctant to speak out on the Uighurs earlier because it was in the process of renewing a controversial accord with Beijing on the appointment of bishops. The accord, which Pompeo urged the Vatican to abandon, was renewed in September.
Francis also gives his clearest support to date in the book to universal basic income (UBI), a controversial policy espoused by some economists and sociologists in which governments give a fixed amount of money to each citizen with no conditions attached. 
UBI was a cornerstone of the campaign of Andrew Yang last year during the Democratic presidential primaries in the United States.
""Recognising the value to society of the work of nonearners
is a vital part of our rethinking in the post-Covid world. That's why I believe it is time to explore concepts like the universal basic income (UBI) ..."" he said.
""By providing a universal basic income, we can free and enable people to work for the community in a dignified way,"" he said.
Francis again criticised trickle-down economics, the theory favoured by conservatives that tax breaks and other incentives for big business and the wealthy eventually will benefit the rest of society through investment and job creation.

He called it ""the false assumption of the infamous trickle-down theory that a growing economy will make us all richer.""

Hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets since the Constitutional Tribunal ruled on Oct. 22 to further limit already restrictive abortion rules, the latest phase of a battle between liberals and religious conservatives in Poland.
Strajk Kobiet (Women's Strike) organised a car blockade on a bridge in Warsaw and dozens gathered separately in front of the ministry in the capital Warsaw late on Monday afternoon, footage from private broadcaster TVN showed. 
Protesters unveiled a large poster outside the ministry that read ""Free Abortion, Free Education"" and chanted ""schools free of fascism"", state news agency PAP said.
Police cordoned off the building with vans, blocking protesters and lifting up those sitting on the ground, TV footage showed. 
Szpila, an ""anti-repression"" activist group, said four protesters were detained by police. A spokesman for the Warsaw police did not respond to a request for comment. 
While centred on abortion, the protests have channeled a broader outpouring of anger at Poland's nationalist rulers and their allies in the Catholic church.
The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has faced criticism for appointing Przemyslaw Czarnek, a vocal critic of the spread of ""LGBT ideology"", as minister of education, in what many see as a lurch further to the right on social issues. 
Police said one protester was hurt after trying to pull protective glass from a police vehicle. Local media had earlier reported a protester was hit by a police van.
The ruling nationalists have faced criticism for allowing for an increasingly firm police response to the protests.

BERLIN (Reuters) - With restrictions on family gatherings, instructions not to hug and a polite request to St Nicholas to ""keep your distance"", Europe is preparing for its first COVID-19 Christmas.
Governments across the continent, which accounts for a quarter of reported global infections and deaths, are trying to fine-tune restrictions on public life to allow families to celebrate Christmas without super-spreading the virus.
Most are due to unveil plans for Christmas this week and many are thinking along similar lines: restricted family gatherings, with festive traditions - like German Christmas markets and Wise Men parades in Spain - widely cancelled.
In Belgium, one of the hardest hit countries in Europe, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo is worried about a third wave of infections just as the second starts to flatten.
""Either we break a third wave at Christmas or we make a third wave at Christmas,"" De Croo, who plans to celebrate only with his wife and two children, said on Sunday.
Underlining its message, the Belgian government has written to St Nicholas, whose Dec. 6 visit with presents for children is a national festive highlight, urging him to: ""Keep your distance, wash your hands regularly and wear a mask when necessary"".
In Italy, which has the second highest toll in Europe after Britain, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned last week: ""We will have to spend the festivities in a more sober way. Big parties, kisses and hugs will not be possible.""
Paris will forgo its ice rinks and Christmas market this year and Moscow has cancelled big public celebrations, instead encouraging people to take a stroll to enjoy the city's lights and decorations. 
Faced with restrictions, Europeans are getting innovative. One Bavarian innkeeper has opened a drive-through Christmas market and in the Netherlands children are enjoying a drive-in, distanced meeting with SinterKlaas.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has said German families should be able to come together for Christmas, ""perhaps with protective measures"".
The prospect of controls has provoked dissent in her Christian Democrats. Friedrich Merz, a contender to become party leader next year, told the Tagesspiegel daily: ""It is none of the state's business how I celebrate Christmas with my family.""
In London, the government said it was working with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ease restrictions over Christmas to allow families to meet, despite a scientific adviser warning that mixing at Christmas posed substantial risks.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez summed up the balancing act governments face: ""We have two wishes: to be with and embrace those we love the most, and the obligation to protect them. Because without a doubt our greatest aspiration is to be able to live and share many more Christmases in the company of our loved ones.""
Across the Atlantic, Americans are already offering a preview of what Christmas could look like with millions defying health warnings and traveling ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
U.S. airport travel on Sunday reached its highest peak since March while U.S. COVID-19 infections are hitting a record 168,000 per day.

""I'm asking Americans, I'm begging you: hold on a little bit longer,"" U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams told the ABC News show ""Good Morning America"" on Monday. ""We want everyone to understand that these holiday celebrations can be superspreader events.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out new measures on Monday to replace a COVID-19 lockdown in England from Dec. 2, reinforcing a previous regional approach to try to reopen businesses where infection rates are lower. 
Just over two weeks after Johnson introduced a national lockdown for England to try to tame a spiralling increase in new coronavirus cases, he said the measures had reduced COVID infection rates and would be eased on Dec. 2 as promised.
Johnson has also been under pressure to scrap the lockdown from lawmakers in his Conservative Party, where many have threatened to vote against any new restrictions they consider overly damaging to the economy without more evidence of their effect in stemming infections.
"" We are going to go back ... to a regional, tiered approach,"" he told parliament virtually from home where he is self-isolating. 
Trying to ease the concerns among sceptics within his party, he said the measures would run until the end of March.
""This will be still a hard winter, Christmas cannot be normal and there is a long road to spring. But we have turned a corner and the escape route is in sight,"" he said. 
""We must hold out against the virus until testing and vaccines come to our rescue and reduce the need for restrictions.""
After his statement, as he was answering questions from lawmakers, his video-conference connection failed and health minister Matt Hancock had to take over.
But the message to his own party was clear: an appeal to vote in favour of the new measures next week to make sure hospitals can cope during winter, when demand increases.

Some are bound to criticise 'Tier 3' (very high alert) restrictions, which mean that bars, cafes and restaurants must remain shut except for takeaway services, and that households cannot mix except in public places outdoors.

Security Council about a major attack that it said militants from Pakistan had attempted in the Indian part of Kashmir last week, government officials said.
The four militants, belonging to the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, infiltrated into Indian Kashmir through a tunnel in the Samba area, the government said. The heavily armed men carried radio sets, a mobile phone, medicines and foods all made in Pakistan, it said. 
They were moving in a truck and when that was stopped for a routine inspection at a checkpoint in Nagrota, they opened fire, the government said. Security forces killed all four of them. 
Pakistan has rejected allegations of any involvement in the alleged attack and said these were aimed at diverting attention from India's repression of the people of Kashmir.
Stepping up the diplomatic offensive against the arch rival, Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla met the envoys of the United States, Britain, France, Russia and Pakistan's ally, China, to convey the country's grave concern about the risks of a major militant attack traced back to Pakistan, a government source said.
""The heads of missions were provided with a detailed information docket giving the details of the incident as it transpired as well as list of items and munitions that were recovered from terrorists clearly indicating their Pakistani origins,"" the source briefed on the meeting said.
India says Pakistan gives material support to the militants fighting its rule in Muslim majority Kashmir, a charge that Islamabad denies.
Last week's incident was part of Pakistan's ongoing terror campaign in Kashmir, Shringla told the envoys.

He sent sexual images of young women that he had found online in exchange for the boys sending him videos and images of themselves. Once he had built up their trust, he blackmailed them into sending him more extreme footage of themselves – and in some cases of them abusing younger siblings or friends.
Appearing at Ipswich Crown Court on Monday, he admitted 96 offences against 51 boys, aged from four to 14. The NCA said there was evidence that as many as 500 victims had sent him images, and that he had contacted 5,000 children worldwide.
""He knew the anguish victims were suffering but ignored any pleas from them to stop until he got what he wanted from them,"" Tony Cook from the NCA said. 
Police said Wilson's activities came to light in 2017 when Facebook identified 20 accounts of boys, aged from 12 to 15, who had sent indecent images of themselves to an account seemingly belonging to a 13-year-old girl.
Those details were passed to the NCA by the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). In total, the NCMEC handed over 90 referrals from Facebook.
Wilson will be sentenced on Jan. 12.

In May 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump quit a deal with Tehran that sought to limit Iran's nuclear programme to prevent it from developing atomic weapons in return for the easing of economic sanctions.
While the United States restored sanctions and announced a ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Iran, the other signatories - Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China - upheld the agreement with Tehran.
""With the new U.S. administration taking office next year, we will get the opportunity to again use the JCPOA (the nuclear deal with Iran) for what it was meant for - to curtail Iran's nuclear programme,"" a German diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Seeing how Iran increasingly violates its nuclear obligations, this is urgently needed,"" he added after a meeting of the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain in Berlin for talks on Iran.
The diplomat said the three European countries, known as the E3, were preparing for a period of intensive diplomacy, knowing they would be facing difficult negotiations.

Biden, who will take office on Jan. 20, has said he will rejoin the agreement if Iran first resumes strict compliance and will work with allies ""to strengthen and extend it, while more effectively pushing back against Iran's other destabilising activities"".

Some of the women were Australian and the issue has sparked outrage in Australia. Qatari officials said the searches were conducted in order to locate the mother of a new-born child found abandoned in a garbage bin in an airport bathroom.
Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said the searches were appalling and Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz al-Thani has apologised. 
Judicial police officers working in the Airport Security Department broke the law when they summoned female medical staff to conduct the searches, the public prosecutor said in a statement on Monday
The police officers acted unilaterally and face ""penalties of a maximum of three years,"" it said.
The public prosecutor did not say what crimes had been committed, how many police officers had been charged or detail the penalties they faced, such as imprisonment, if convicted.
The public prosecutor said it had also charged the child's mother, who has left the country, with attempted murder and that it had launched legal proceedings to arrest her.
The mother, identified as of ""Asian nationality"", faces a maximum penalty of 15 years if convicted, the statement said.
It also said a male defendant had been identified as the father of the child after a DNA test, without saying how they were able to initially locate him.
The mother of the abandoned child had messaged the father telling him she had just given birth and that she was abandoning the child and leaving the country, the prosecutor said.
It was not clear what charges the father faced.
The baby girl is being taken care of by Qatari authorities.
The prosecutor said in the statement that the medical staff had been summoned to conduct ""external examination of female passengers"", contradicting Australian officials who said the women had been invasively searched.

Reuters reported last week that Mexico agreed with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to seek the arrest of a high-level Mexican drug cartel leader as part of a deal to get U.S. drug trafficking charges against Cienfuegos dropped. 
""There is no deal in the shadows,"" Lopez Obrador said at his regular news conference, referring to the Reuters story as well as other media reports that Mexico had threatened to expel U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents over Cienfuegos' arrest.
He said it was wrong to suggest that the United States sent Cienfuegos back so that Mexico would send Washington a leader of organized crime.
Cienfuegos' arrest in Los Angeles in October followed a multi-year investigation that used wire taps to track a military figure, dubbed ""El Padrino"" (The Godfather) by traffickers.
Investigators concluded ""El Padrino"" was Cienfuegos and that he helped drug traffickers move tonnes of narcotics.

Mexico's government, angry it was not forewarned about the investigation, hailed Cienfuegos' return on Wednesday as a diplomatic achievement and a win for the nation's sovereignty.

""The beginning of the end is within reach,"" government spokesman Redwan Hussein said of the nearly three-week-old offensive that has destabilised Ethiopia and spilled into some Horn of Africa neighbours.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has told the TPLF, which had been ruling the mountainous northern zone of 5 million people, to lay down arms by Wednesday or face a final assault on Mekelle, a highland city of half a million people. 
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael denied that Mekelle was surrounded and told Reuters the ultimatum threat was a cover for government forces to regroup after what he described as defeats on three fronts.
Reuters could not verify the latest statements. 
Claims by all sides are hard to verify because phone and internet communication has been down.
Hundreds, possibly thousands, have been killed in fighting and air strikes that erupted on Nov. 4, sending about 40,000 refugees into neighbouring Sudan, after the government accused the TPLF of ambushing a federal military base.
The conflict has spread beyond Tigray, with the TPLF firing rockets into both the neighbouring Amhara region and across the border to Eritrea, which Tigrayans accuse of supporting government forces, something Asmara denies.
Redwan told a news conference that the government now controlled most of Tigray and people in captured towns were handing over weapons given them by the TPLF. 
Federal forces were ringing Mekelle from about 50 km, he added in a text to Reuters. 
Tigrayan forces fired rockets on Monday at Bahir Dar, the capital of Amhara region whose authorities are supporting the federal offensive, Redwan and residents said. He said the rockets caused no damage. 
""So far, I didn’t hear of any casualties,"" said a hotel receptionist of the pre-dawn attack. ""I guess now we are accustomed to it and there wasn’t much panic."" 
ANCIENT AXUM
Addis Ababa police have arrested some 796 people suspected of plotting ""terrorist attacks"" in the capital for the TPLF, the state-affiliated Fana broadcaster reported.
There was no immediate comment from Ethiopia's government or the TPLF.
The government said TPLF troops had destroyed the airport at the ancient town of Axum, a popular tourist draw and UNESCO World Heritage site 215 km (133 miles) northwest of Mekelle. 
The TPLF's Debretsion denied this, saying obstacles had been put up to block advances by the Ethiopian military.
Axum's history and ruins, including fourth-century obelisks erected when the Axumite Empire was at its height, gives Ethiopia its claim to be one of the world's oldest centres of Christianity.
Legend says it was home to the Queen of Sheba and Ethiopians believe a church there houses the Ark of the Covenant.
The TPLF accuses Abiy of invading their region to dominate them. ""We are people of principle and are ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region,"" TPLF leader Debretsion added in a text message to Reuters. 
Debretsion was a signals and intelligence officer for the TPLF in their war against Ethiopia's Marxist dictatorship in the 1980s and later earned a degree in electronic engineering from Addis Ababa University. 
He rose to the rank of deputy prime minister in the Ethiopian government when it was dominated by the TPLF.
The TPLF accuses Abiy, a former military comrade and coalition partner, of marginalising their ethnic group since becoming prime minister two years ago. He has removed Tigrayan officials from influential roles in government and the military and detained some on rights abuse and corruption charges.
Abiy, whose parents are from the larger Oromo and Amhara groups, denies any ethnic undertones, saying he is legitimately pursuing criminals and preserving national unity.
The African Union (AU) has named three envoys for potential talks over Tigray. Redwan said Abiy would meet them and was open to all options except negotiating with the TPLF.

Attorney General Gedion Timothewos Hessebon said TPLF actions, including attacks on the military's Northern Command, Amhara and Eritrea, may constitute treason and terrorism. Authorities have frozen the assets of 38 companies linked to them, he added.

The country's Investigative Committee, the body that probes major crimes, said it had detained Gazi Isayev, an Interior Ministry official overseeing the Kizlyarsky district of Dagestan as part of a investigation into the attack that killed 39 people and injured more than 100 others. 
It said that Isayev had driven a female suicide bomber, clad in an explosive belt, to a bus station near the town of Kizlyar, from where she would travel some 1,470 km (910 miles) north to carry out the attack.
The Investigative Committee also said Isayev had been a member of the Imarat Kavkaz terrorist group -- also known as Caucasus Emirate -- and that he had passed information on police activity and special operations to the organisation.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Saudi Arabia and met its crown prince, an Israeli official said on Monday, in what would be the first publicly confirmed visit there by an Israeli leader as the countries close ranks against Iran.
Earlier, Israeli media said Netanyahu had secretly flown on Sunday to Neom, on the Red Sea, for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Reports of the meeting between the crown prince and Netanyahu were denied by Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.
""I met Pompeo at the airport and went with him to the meeting. I then took him back to the airport. Saudi and American officials were the only ones present throughout,"" he said.
Saudi Arabia, Islam's birthplace, has long championed the Palestinian cause and shunned official contacts with Israel.
Netanyahu, speaking publicly after the Saudi denial, was circumspect about any clandestine travel.
Asked at a meeting of his right-wing Likud faction about a Saudi visit, Netanyahu replied: ""Are you serious? Friends, throughout my years I have never commented on such things and I don't intend to start doing so now.""
Spokesmen for Pompeo declined comment.
But asked about the Israeli media reports, Yoav Gallant, a member of Netanyahu's security cabinet, told Army Radio: ""The very fact the meeting happened, and was outed publicly, even if half-officially right now, is a matter of great importance.""
Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz, in a speech, condemned ""the irresponsible leak of the secret flight to Saudi Arabia"".
SIGNAL TO BIDEN? 
Netanyahu, in an apparent message to U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, said in a speech on Sunday there should be no return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal abandoned by President Donald Trump.
As Trump's term winds down, Pompeo has been trying to coax Saudi Arabia to follow the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan in moving toward formal diplomatic relations with Israel. 
Israel sent a delegation to Sudan on Monday, according to Israeli media. Israeli and Sudanese officials did not comment.
Israel and its Gulf partners may share concern about a possible review of U.S. policies in the region by Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20. Biden has said he would rejoin the nuclear accord that world powers signed with Iran if it first resumed strict compliance with the deal, and would work with allies to strengthen its terms.
Since August, Riyadh has allowed Israeli airliners to overfly Saudi territory to newly available Gulf destinations and Asia. More publicly closing ranks with the Saudi crown prince could help the conservative Netanyahu burnish his statesman credentials as he faces domestic challenges.
They include a trial on corruption charges - which Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, denies - and a feud with centrist coalition partner Gantz.
""Gantz does politics while the prime minister makes peace,"" Netanyahu spokesman Topaz Luk tweeted. 
Asked on Saturday whether Riyadh had changed its position on Israel, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said the kingdom had favoured normalisation ""for a long time"", but on condition Israel and the Palestinians reach ""a permanent and full peace deal"". 

Palestinian militant groups condemned the news of a softer Saudi line on their enemy, Israel. Palestinian Islamic Jihad called it ""a betrayal of Jerusalem, blessed Mecca and Medina"".

""It's a nice alternative, so that we can meet the children and the children can really come see Sinterklaas in person,"" Nienke Spruit, who acted as one of the saint's jolly helpers at a drive-in in the city of Apeldoorn on Sunday, told Reuters.
Dozens of cars waited in line to let children sing a song to Sinterklaas or hand drawings to his helpers through their windows in return for a gift.
In Dutch lore, St. Nicholas travels once a year from Spain on a steamship laden with presents, accompanied by dozens of helpers who traditionally have their faces painted black. Together, children are told, they travel the land for two weeks, handing out cookies and presents, finishing with a night of gifts and poems on Dec. 5.
But the coronavirus has drastically changed things in the Netherlands, with public events banned and groups of no more than four people allowed to meet.
The government last month urged people to limit this year's celebrations to their own household, while towns and cities had to scrap festivities, which usually attract large crowds.
But that is not the only change facing Sinterklaas, as growing numbers say his helpers' traditional image is a racist caricature.
The clownish servants known as ""Black Pete"" are usually played by white people in black face paint, frizzy wigs and red lipstick. 
In a national poll this year, 45% said Pete's image should change, up from less than 30% last year.
In Apeldoorn, the Petes wore only dabs of black paint on their cheeks, representing soot from the chimneys they are said to climb down to deliver presents. 
""Make-up covering the whole face is outdated,"" Spruit said. ""We are doing soot, to make it acceptable for everyone.""

""Our message is we're going to be here, we've got your back, and we're not leaving,"" said O'Brien, on a visit to the Philippines after concluding a trip to Vietnam on Sunday.
""I think when we send that message –  that peace-through-strength message – is the way to deter China. It is a way to ensure the peace,"" O'Brien said.
Vietnam and the Philippines have been the most vocal regional opponents to what they see as Chinese overreach in the South China Sea and its disregard for boundaries outlined in international maritime law. 
China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam each claim parts of it.
The United States has long opposed China's expansive claims, sending warships regularly through the strategic waterway to demonstrate freedom of navigation there.
China maintains it is a force for peace in the region and sees the U.S. presence as provocative and interference by an outsider. 
O'Brien, who led the turnover in Manila of $18 million worth of precision-guided munitions, said the United States stood with the Philippines in protecting its offshore resource entitlements. 
""Those resources belong to the children and grandchildren of the people here,"" he said.
""They don't belong to some other country that just because they may be bigger than the Philippines,"" he said, adding: ""That's just wrong."" 
His visit came more than a week after the Philippines suspended its scrapping of a Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the United States for a second time, as the treaty allies work on a long-term mutual defence arrangement.

Last year, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assured the Philippines it would come to its defense if attacked in the South China Sea.

Shamima Begum, who was born to Bangladeshi parents, left London in 2015 when she was 15 and went to Syria via Turkey with two schoolfriends. 
In Syria, she married an Islamic State fighter and lived in Raqqa, the capital of the self-declared caliphate, where she remained for four years until she was discovered in a detention camp. She has had three children since leaving Britain, but all the infants have since died.
Britain's interior minister stripped her of her British citizenship but in July, the Court of Appeal unanimously agreed Begum, now 21, could only have a fair and effective appeal of that decision if she were permitted to come back to Britain.
Challenging that verdict, James Eadie, the lawyer for the British government, told the Supreme Court that intelligence agencies concluded those who aligned with Islamic State posed a serious risk to national security. 
""The assessment was that she presented a current threat, justifying the removal of her British citizenship and thereby placing serious practical and legal impediments on national security grounds in the way of her return to the United Kingdom,"" Eadie said.
Begum's case has been the subject of a heated debate in Britain, pitting those who say she forsook her right to citizenship by travelling to join IS against those who argue she should not be left stateless but rather face trial in Britain.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey and Russia are at odds over Ankara's wish to set up an independent military observation post on Azeri territory, a Turkish source said, after the two agreed this month to monitor a ceasefire in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Turkey and Russia have already agreed to set up a joint centre in the region to monitor the Nov. 10 ceasefire, which ended weeks of fighting between Azerbaijan's troops and ethnic Armenian forces in the enclave.
Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated by ethnic Armenians.
The ceasefire agreement, which locked in Azerbaijan's territorial gains from the fighting, involves the deployment of some 2,000 Russian peacekeepers to Nagorno-Karabakh. 
Russian and Turkish officials have still to agree on the parameters of the monitoring mechanism, but Turkey, a staunch ally of Azerbaijan, also wants its own independent observation post to boost its influence in a region it sees as key to its own security.
""The biggest difference of opinion right now is the observation post Turkey will establish on Azerbaijan's lands,"" the Turkish source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Russia thinks it is unnecessary for Turkey to establish an observation post in the region independent of the joint centre. However, this is necessary for Turkey.""
The source said talks would continue in Moscow and that Turkey expected eventually to reach a compromise with Russia.
There was no immediate comment on the matter from Russia, Armenia or Azerbaijan.
Turkey has backed Azerbaijan, with which it has close ethnic and cultural ties, since the start of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict nearly 30 years ago and has demanded the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all Azeri territory.
France said last week it wanted international supervision to implement the ceasefire, concerned that Russia and Turkey could strike a deal to cut out Western powers from future peace talks.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>","Special Report: Ortega media enrich his family, entrench his hold on Nicaragua","By Drazen Jorgic and Ismael Lopez
MANAGUA (Reuters) - In early 2010, Nicaragua's Canal 8, an independent television network, had a new owner. 
Details of the deal – the identity of the buyer, the purchase price, an exact date for the transaction – remained secret. The seller died of cancer soon after. 
But a familiar face soon took charge at Canal 8: the son of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. The leftist leader, who rose to prominence in the late Cold War with his Sandinista revolutionaries, had reclaimed the presidency three years before. 
Canal 8 was long known for scrutinizing administrations both left and right. But new chief executive Juan Carlos Ortega Murillo, then 28 years old, quickly imposed orders for ""good news"" about his father's government, according to several former employees of the station. 
Many Nicaraguans quickly concluded the young Ortega's appointment meant the first family or its allies were behind the acquisition. They were right.
According to previously undisclosed tax documents from earlier this year, Canal 8 is owned by Yadira Leets Marin, wife of Rafael Ortega Murillo, another son of the president. It isn't clear whether Leets Marin was involved in the 2010 purchase, but the documents identify her as Canal 8's majority owner now. She didn't respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
The takeover of Canal 8 by the Ortega clan was the first step in a media strategy that over the past decade has saturated the Central American country's airwaves, newsstands and smartphone screens with pro-government coverage. 
The strategy was hinted at by Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, in a public communique she issued as the president's communications chief shortly after he began his second administration in 2007. The goal: not only ensure positive coverage, but also secure outright control of media properties by Ortega and allies.
In the years since, the president, his family and close associates have gained ownership or managerial control of at least a dozen TV channels, radio stations, and online news sites. 
Some of the acquisitions, including the Canal 8 deal, were financed at least in part by funds provided by oil-rich Venezuela, said three current and former employees and people familiar with the acquisitions. 
The Ortega family itself, according to 2020 tax and corporate registration documents reviewed by Reuters, controls ownership of Canal 8 and radio broadcaster Radio Ya. 
Friends and close allies, according to the documents, own three additional television channels – Canal 4, Canal 13, and Canal 22 – all managed by children of the Ortegas. A fourth station, Canal 2, is also owned by an associate, according to people familiar with the channel, and the Ortegas manage its news operations. 
Through state ownership, the Ortegas control TV broadcaster Canal 6, national network Radio Nicaragua, and online news portals like El 19 Digital. Associates of the first family own at least three other radio stations, all openly allied with the government.
Nicaraguans for years have speculated about the extent of the Ortegas' control of their country's media landscape. But the family has never officially disclosed what assets it owns or operates through allied investors.
Reuters interviewed current and former employees of outlets controlled by the family as well as dozens of government officials, people at rival media, and Nicaraguan tax and legal experts. They provide the fullest portrayal yet of how Canal 8 came under the Ortegas' control and how the family went on to use budget and tax laws to squeeze rival media and tighten their own grip on power. 
The office of the president didn't return calls or emails from Reuters seeking comment for this report. Murillo, who is now vice president as well as government spokeswoman, didn't respond to separate requests for comment. Juan Carlos, Rafael and other Ortega relatives named in this story didn't respond, either. Canal 8 and other media properties run by the family didn't respond to queries.
The clan's media empire has crowded out voices opposed to Ortega. ""Canal 8 was a space where different, independent journalism was possible,"" said Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a prominent journalist who left the station because of the acquisition. ""It was a key move toward concentrating control.""
As the media empire shores up the president's power, his government is steering large sums of state money into the properties controlled by the family and its allies. 
Over the past two years, Nicaragua's government bought advertising worth an estimated $59 million from the three biggest TV channels owned or controlled by the Ortega family, according to data compiled by Media Guru, a consultancy that tracks media spending. The government spent an estimated $230,000, less than 1% as much, at channels not affiliated with the Ortegas. 
In another benefit for the Ortegas and their allies, at least two of their channels, unlike rival media, don't appear to have paid taxes in recent years, according to previously unreported tax documents reviewed by Reuters. 
Over the past decade, Canal 8 hasn't paid more than $4 million in tax and interest it should have under Nicaraguan law, according to the documents, a finding supported by local tax experts who examined the materials for Reuters.
""They've created a system in which the money comes out of the national budget, runs through their holdings, and all stays in their pockets,"" said Alfonso Malespin, a media specialist at the University of Commercial Sciences in Managua, Nicaragua's capital.
The media effort is a family affair. 
Ortega has been aided by his wife, Murillo. Once a poet, she is widely considered the architect of the media strategy. Their children play key roles: In addition to Juan Carlos and Rafael, four other Ortega Murillo children run major media properties or hold stakes in them.
The Ortega family's media activities appear to violate several Nicaraguan laws, according to local attorneys consulted by Reuters. By channeling state funds to family-controlled properties, the Ortegas flout legislation that governs behavior and procurement by public servants, the attorneys said. 
Because some of the acquisitions were allegedly made in part through a joint venture controlled by Venezuela's state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, lawyers said the purchases broke a law that forbids foreign ownership of Nicaraguan media outlets. 
And by not paying taxes, the lawyers said, Canal 8 may be violating Nicaraguan tax laws – statutes that Ortega has used to confiscate assets, including studios and newsprint, from rival media. ""If the rule of law were respected here, there would be clear criminal and civil penalties, with people arrested and companies impounded,"" Alberto Novoa, a former solicitor general who reviewed the tax documents, told Reuters. 
Political opponents, human rights activists, and foreign powers including the United States and the European Union say Ortega's media might has made Nicaragua more autocratic. State propaganda, they argue, was instrumental in helping Ortega secure two re-elections, in 2011 and 2016, and weather a wave of bloody anti-government protests in 2018. 
More than 300 people died during those protests, some killed by government snipers on rooftops. Police raided the newsrooms of rival media, arresting journalists and confiscating computers and other equipment, while Murillo went on family-run broadcasters to decry demonstrators as ""coup-plotters"" and ""terrorists."" More recently, she has used the platforms to label independent media ""termites"" and ""extremists."" 
In a statement earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attacks, ""including the use of spurious revenue charges to shutter studios and seize equipment, demonstrate that Ortega, along with Vice President Rosario Murillo, are interested only in prolonging their rule.""
The media strategy has been cited by the United States among abuses for which it has sanctioned family members and associates including Murillo, Juan Carlos and Rafael, husband of Canal 8 owner Leets Marin. In a June statement, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Juan Carlos for spreading ""regime propaganda."" 
Last year, the Treasury accused Rafael of using various companies, including a chain of state-run gas stations, to launder money and hide family assets. ""Rafael Ortega is the key money manager behind the Ortega family's illicit financial schemes,"" it said in a statement. 
Nicaragua's government appears unchastened.
The National Assembly, the country's pro-Ortega legislature, recently passed laws that further pressure rival media. One bill makes it a crime for anyone to spread ""false"" information via social media or in news outlets. Another imposes prison sentences of up to six years for anyone convicted of publishing information ""not authorized"" by the government.
With such measures, opponents say, reality has become increasingly distorted across the country of more than 6 million people. Nicaraguans will go to the polls again next year. They will have a diminishing number of independent sources covering the state of their country, the second-poorest in the Americas after Haiti, and its leadership. 
""It's the opposite of reality,"" says Gioconda Belli, a novelist and poet once close to Murillo. ""It's totally Orwellian.""
""NEW AND BETTER WAYS OF COMMUNICATING""
Ortega, now 75, was once an icon for leftist revolutionaries worldwide and a symbol of hope for a Nicaraguan society long torn by inequality. With Coke-bottle glasses and a bookish demeanor, he was chosen by colleagues as Sandinista leader after they toppled Anastasio Somoza, the last in a string of dictators, in 1979. 
Ortega, Sandinista colleagues said, appeared less power-hungry than more ambitious rivals at the time. 
Nicaraguans elected Ortega president in 1984. He was plagued by economic and social problems, however, and voters denied him a second term five years later. He remained Sandinista chief but spent the next 16 years in the opposition, failing three times to return to the presidency.
For most of their first act, his wife, Murillo, lay low.
The 69-year-old first lady, fluent in English and French, at the time was known mostly for mystical writings and her kaleidoscopic wardrobe. ""Rosario had no influence in the '80s and '90s,"" said Victor Hugo Tinoco, a former Sandinista who served as United Nations ambassador and deputy foreign minister in Ortega's first term.
More recently, Ortega has deployed Murillo's communication skills. Her media savvy, people familiar with the couple said, helped him remake his image. 
Ortega once sported military fatigues like those of Fidel Castro, his friend and mentor; the leftie look gave way to jeans and Oxford shirts. The couple mended fences with the Catholic Church and businesspeople their party once antagonized. 
In 2006, the transformation carried Ortega back to victory.
Upon his inauguration in January 2007, Ortega made Murillo his communications chief. She told aides the government should find ways to publish news ""uncontaminated"" by critical media, according to several people familiar with the discussions. 
In a ""Communications Policy"" statement that February, Murillo criticized what she saw as favoritism by previous administrations and their practice of having government agencies and state-owned firms place ads in friendly major media. Ortega's government, she wrote, would ""seek new and better ways of communicating."" 
Right away, Ortega's government began playing favorites of its own, according to journalists and media executives. It advertised with left-leaning newspapers and broadcasters and shunned outlets it deemed critical. 
Murillo centralized the advertising budgets of all ministries and took full control of their communications, according to former government officials involved in the changes. She put Daniel Edmundo Ortega, another of the couple's nine children, in charge of Canal 4, a channel owned by Sandinista allies that he continues to manage. 
Ortega's return came at the peak of the so-called ""Pink Tide,"" a wave of leftist victories that swept Latin America starting around the turn of the century. In the movement's vanguard was Hugo Chavez, the late Venezuelan strongman, whose charisma and petro-dollar diplomacy inspired and financed like-minded leaders across the region. 
In July 2007, the two countries announced the creation of a joint venture, Alba de Nicaragua SA, that would use Venezuelan oil funds to pay for infrastructure and social projects in Nicaragua. The venture, known locally as Albanisa, was meant to begin with $250 million in financing for a refinery west of Managua. 
The refinery never started, but Venezuelan cash flowed in.
The International Monetary Fund, in a 2017 report, estimated that Nicaragua received as much as $3.2 billion from Venezuela before the South American country's economy imploded in recent years. Nicaragua's own central bank has said the figure reached as much as $5 billion. 
But neither government has ever given a full accounting of the financing or how Ortega spent the money, which is equivalent to as much as a third of Nicaragua's annual economic output. 
Spokespeople at Venezuela's information ministry and PDVSA didn't respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
By 2008, Ortega's family and close associates had begun building what today is a business empire with assets in energy, security and other sectors. Juan Carlos that year launched Difuso Comunicaciones SA, an advertising agency. 
The agency quickly attracted clients eager to do business with those in power. People familiar with the ad agency's operations say it serves as a conduit for much of the government's advertising. Difuso produces commercials for state tourism, the ports agency, the electricity authority and other agencies, these people say, and places the ads on channels controlled by the family. 
Government documents reviewed by Reuters show that Difuso's owners include Maria Luisa Mejia, who is regularly referred to in Nicaragua as one of first lady Murillo's attorneys. Another Difuso owner is Nestor Moncada Lau, an advisor to President Ortega. 
In 2018, the U.S. sanctioned Moncada for allegedly paying counter-demonstrators to clash with protestors that year and bribing other Nicaraguans to keep them from opposing the government. 
Mejia has never publicly addressed her reported role as Murillo's attorney. She didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Moncada, though widely considered a close aide of Ortega, has never given an interview. Reuters was unable to reach him. 
When Juan Carlos took the reins at Canal 8, workers were surprised by what suddenly seemed like a bottomless budget, according to five former employees of the channel. He bought modern studio equipment, they said, and wooed rival journalists with good salaries. He sent iPads and other gifts to the heads of ad agencies from which he hoped to win non-government business. 
Questions began circulating in Nicaragua about the source of the money in Canal 8's newly fat wallet. Rafael Paniagua, the Venezuelan then in charge of Albanisa, told a Managua newspaper in 2010 that Canal 8 was purchased for roughly $10 million by the Nicaragua-Venezuela joint venture. Paniagua left Nicaragua abruptly afterward and never returned. 
Reuters was unable to determine how ownership of the channel was transferred from Albanisa to Leets Marin. Paniagua couldn't be reached for comment.
Rodrigo Obregon, another former Albanisa executive who retired in 2014, recently supported Paniagua's assertion. The Canal 8 acquisition, Obregon told Reuters in an interview, was part of a plan by Ortega to replicate Chavez's strategy of bringing the media under state control to ""indoctrinate"" the masses. 
""They were interested in all the radio and TV broadcasters they could buy,"" Obregon said. 
""IGNORE EVERYTHING""
Throughout Ortega's second and third terms, his family took control of more broadcasters, often with close associates as owners. Generous compensation made jobs at these outlets attractive for some journalists. The perks included discounted homes at subsidized housing developments, according to four people familiar with the benefits. 
In exchange, Murillo expected reporters to toe the Sandinista line. 
In 2011, Noel Miranda, a reporter at Radio Ya, a Managua station, asked Murillo at a press conference about allegations by local academics that the government was growing autocratic. Radio Ya is owned by Entretenimiento Digital SA, a company controlled by Rafael Ortega, according to previously undisclosed ownership documents reviewed by Reuters. 
Murillo looked at the reporter's identification card, stared him down, and ignored the question. The following day, Miranda said, he wasn't allowed back at work. The station didn't renew the six-month contract he was on, and Miranda is now a reporter for an online news site in Managua. ""We knew there were limits,"" Miranda told Reuters. 
Miranda's account was substantiated by several former colleagues. Executives at Radio Ya and Entretenimiento Digital didn't respond to emails and phone calls from Reuters for comment.
That same year, the Ortegas launched a new television station, Canal 13, managed by three other Ortega Murillo children: Camila, Maurice and Luciana. One of the channel's owners, according to government documents reviewed by Reuters, is Mejia, the attorney who also is part-owner of Difuso, the advertising agency. 
Three years later, in 2014, Maurice Ortega also began managing the news operations of Canal 2, another major station owned by Ortega allies.
With more platforms in the hands of the family, the Ortega government increased state spending on advertising more than tenfold, according to data compiled by Media Guru, the advertising consultancy. The data, independently reviewed by Reuters, is based on market rates for advertising on channels across the country. 
Media Guru, which has offices in Managua and elsewhere in Central America, declined to comment. 
Between 2000 and 2010, according to a person familiar with the data, Nicaragua's government spent an estimated $2.6 million a year on advertising. By 2019, the data show, the figure had soared to an estimated $29 million annually. 
Last year, all but roughly $128,000, or 0.44% of that amount, went toward advertising with Ortega family outlets, according to a Reuters calculation based on the data. The ads are purchased by government agencies and by state-run companies like the gas-station chain controlled by Rafael Ortega.
At Canal 8 alone, advertising placed by the state jumped from roughly $400,000 in 2009 to an estimated annual average of more than $6 million over the past decade, according to the person familiar with the data. Last year, the government placed ads worth an estimated $16.8 million with the channel, the data show. 
By comparison, Canal 10, Nicaragua's most popular station and a channel not controlled by the Ortegas, in 2019 received less than $9,000 in state advertising, according to the data. Executives at Canal 10 didn't respond to requests for comment.
The person familiar with the Media Guru data confirmed the accuracy of the spending figures reported here. Separately, three advertising executives in Nicaragua told Reuters the estimates are realistic. 
With unrivaled reach, the Ortega family's messaging permeated the country.
Murillo grew especially visible, appearing on family-run channels, often daily, and issuing orders about coverage and editorial priorities through offspring at the helm of each broadcaster. ""She is like the head of an octopus, her children the tentacles,"" said one journalist who formerly worked at one of the broadcasters. 
In 2014, Sandinista legislators scrapped presidential term limits. Two years later, Ortega won a fourth term and Murillo, now his running mate, the vice presidency. Ortega barred international observers from the election. 
In 2018, an Ortega plan to increase social security contributions and lower pension payouts sparked demonstrations.
At first, Murillo told state and allied outlets not to cover the unrest. ""The order was to ignore everything,"" said Carlos Mikel Espinosa, then an editor at El 19 Digital, a state-controlled online news portal. Espinosa quit when the upheaval intensified and the government response grew violent.
Foreign governments, the United Nations, and human rights groups denounced Ortega and Sandinista allies for reported killings, beatings, detentions and torture of many protesters. Police raided newsrooms of opposition media, seizing equipment and supplies needed for publishing. 
They arrested Miguel Mora, founder of 100% Noticias, a Managua television station, and shut its broadcasts. The government, Mora told Reuters, claimed the channel owed unpaid taxes, an assertion he denied. ""It was a brutal attack to make us change our editorial line or to make us bankrupt,"" said Mora, who was released but has since left the media business. 
Some outlets controlled by the Ortegas, meanwhile, are shortchanging the government on taxes, Reuters found.
Documents reviewed by Reuters from the General Revenue Directorate, Nicaragua's tax collection agency, show that Canal 8 hasn't paid taxes and interest amounting to about $4 million since 2010, the year Juan Carlos took over. Canal 4, the Sandinista channel managed by Daniel Edmundo Ortega, owes about $380,000 in back taxes, the documents show.
Nicaragua's tax agency didn't respond to requests for comment.
It isn't clear why the taxes have gone unpaid or whether the government has sought to collect them. Tax specialists who reviewed the documents told Reuters both stations are in clear violation of Nicaraguan tax law. ""Any other company would have already been seized,"" one of the experts said. 
Consider the case of Canal 12, a private television station owned by Mariano Valle, a Managua businessman. Valle has sought to keep his channel independent, and its journalists and on-air guests have criticized Ortega policies. 
In September, Ortega's government said the channel owes about $800,000 in unpaid taxes. A judge, pending ongoing litigation, authorized the state to seize the station's offices and cars, and Valle's home, and keep them if the channel loses in court.
The channel in a statement called the moves ""arbitrary and illegal."" In September Valle told a local radio station, ""we don't owe anything."" He didn't respond to requests for comment.
Eduardo Enriquez, editor of La Prensa, the last large independent newspaper still operating in Nicaragua, told Reuters that during the protests, tax authorities used their power to block imports of newsprint and ink. 

The suffocating reach of pro-Ortega propaganda, Enriquez said, means La Prensa and the handful other independent outlets are operating in a ""news desert."" If the Ortegas remain in power, he predicts, ""independent media won't survive.""

Soldiers from the frigate Hamburg boarded the Turkish freighter, the Rosaline A, overnight, but had to abandon checks and withdraw after Turkey protested to the EU mission, the German defence ministry said.
The frigate was operating in the Mediterranean as part of the EU's Irini mission, which aims to stop arms reaching the warring factions in Libya.
""By the time the soldiers left the ship, they had not found anything suspicious,"" a German defence ministry spokesman said.
Turkish security sources said the Rosalina-A was carrying various materials such as food and paint, and that the search team had violated international law by not waiting for permission from Turkey.
It said the soldiers had found nothing despite spending the entire night opening containers on the ship.
""Following the search that lasted until the early hours of the morning, the soldiers understood that there was nothing on the ship apart from humanitarian aid, foods such as biscuits, and paint materials, and left the ship,"" a source said.
Confirming a report in the news magazine Der Spiegel, the German spokesman said the Hamburg had intercepted the Rosaline A about 200 km (125 miles) north of the Libyan city of Benghazi on Sunday night.
He said the Hamburg had followed standard procedure by waiting four hours for approval from the flag country, and then boarding. Later, once the objection arrived, they withdrew.
""All procedures were followed correctly,"" a German foreign ministry spokeswoman said. 

The 16,000-tonne container ship left the Turkish port of Gemlik near Bursa last week, and was last seen off Athens, heading southwest towards Libya, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Tension between Australia and China has been driven by incorrect assumptions shaped by rivalry between China and the United States but Australia has its own interest and independent views, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday.
Australia's relationship with China soured in 2018 when it became the first country to publicly ban China’s Huawei from its 5G network, and worsened this year when Australia called for an enquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus.
As ties deteriorated, China imposed tariffs on Australian barley and slowed its imports of Australian beef and coal. 
But Morrison said in a speech Australia had been unfairly judged.
""Our actions are wrongly seen and interpreted by some only through the lens of the strategic competition between China and the United States,"" Morrison said.
""It's as if Australia does not have its own unique interests or views as an independent sovereign state. This is false and needlessly deteriorates relationships.""
Australian government ministers have recently said they wanted to improve communication with China but its foreign ministry has said Australia needed to “take concrete actions to correct their mistakes”. 
China is by far Australia’s top overall export market, worth $104 billion in 2019 according to the IMF. 
So disruption to trade ties could be costly for Australia's economy, which is already languishing from the impact of the novel coronavirus.

The economy shrank 7% in the three months that ended in June, the most since records began in 1959, while the unemployment rate hit a 22-year high of 7.5% in July.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Some flee on boats. Some hide in the stilts under their homes. Others run into the woods. 
All across Malaysia's Sabah region on Borneo island, stateless residents and undocumented migrants are fleeing public health officials conducting coronavirus screenings, fearful of being detained or deported. 
The race to tackle COVID-19 in Sabah, Malaysia's biggest palm oil producing state, is being complicated by an estimated one million undocumented migrants and stateless residents who account for a third of the population.
Sabah accounts for nearly half of Malaysia's 54,775 recorded COVID-19 infections and over half its 335 deaths despite having barely a tenth of the Southeast Asian country's population. 
But health officials fear the real picture could be much worse as people evade screenings in fear of detention or deportation.
""We see authorities coming, we do what we've always done: run,"" Ahmad Han, an undocumented migrant living on the outskirts of Semporna district in Sabah, told Reuters by phone. 
As of Nov. 17, nearly a fifth of the state's infections involved foreigners, according to government data obtained by Reuters.
They included stateless indigenous communities as well as refugees and migrant workers from neighbouring Philippines and Indonesia, countries that have the highest number of coronavirus cases in the region. 
Sabah has recorded 192 deaths from COVID-19 so far. Of the 176 fatalities recorded in the state as of Nov. 16, 63 people died even before receiving treatment, including 40 foreigners, according to the data provided by Sabah cabinet minister Masidi Manjun. The data included both documented and undocumented migrants. 
""Many would flee whenever they see nurses in uniform or an ambulance,"" Masidi, who is also the state's spokesman on COVID-19 matters, told Reuters.
""We are constantly trying to convince them that they won't be arrested or deported when they go for COVID-19 testing. But the response has been lukewarm to say the least.""
Malaysia's crackdown on undocumented migrants since the start of the pandemic has also worsened fears among vulnerable communities, rights groups say. The country has detained thousands, including during lockdowns, in what it says are efforts to stem the virus' spread. 
'CHALLENGING'
Coronavirus infections have been surging in Sabah since a state-wide election in September. 
Movement restrictions have already hurt production of palm oil, a key export for Malaysia, while an emergency has been declared in one eastern Sabah region to prevent a by-election during the pandemic.
Deprived of income due to lockdown measures and ineligible for government aid, many of the undocumented people depend on working odd jobs to survive and fear that being forced to quarantine would leave their families unable to fend for themselves. 
Doctors in Sabah say some migrants delay seeking treatment even after falling ill, likely leading to more severe COVID-19 infections and the state's higher death rate. 
""Many come in only when they're at the stage where they're having trouble breathing,"" said one doctor at Tawau Hospital in eastern Sabah, who declined to be identified as staff there were not authorised to speak to media. 
Minister Masidi said health officials were working with aid groups and local authorities to reach vulnerable groups.
On islands off Semporna, the Bajau Laut community of sea nomads, most of whom are stateless, only came forward after health officials teamed up with aid agencies to persuade them to undergo screening in exchange for supplies such as rice, oil, baby formula and sanitary pads. 
But even after they were tested, many fled as they feared being quarantined on land. 
""Logistically, it's a huge challenge,"" said Ahmad Kamil of the Sabah-based Surah Al Falah aid group. 

""Many communities live far in the interior or on remote islands so it's hard to do contact tracing or transport patients to health facilities.""

392,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Pope says his brush with death helps him relate to Covid victims,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis says in a new book that he can relate to people in intensive care units who fear dying from coronavirus because of his own experience when part of his lung was removed 63 years ago.
Italian newspapers published excerpts of the new book ""Let Us Dream: The Path to A Better Future,"" on Monday ahead of publication next month.
In the book, a conversation with one of his biographers, Briton Austen Ivereigh, Francis talks in some of the most personal terms to date about the time he was hovering between life and death. 
""I know from experience the feeling of those who are sick with coronavirus, struggling to breathe as they are attached to a ventilator,"" he said. 
Francis was a 21-year-old seminarian in the second year of his studies for the priesthood in his native Buenos Aires when an illness that had been mis-diagnosed as influenza worsened and he was hospitalised.
""They took about a litre and a half of water out of one lung and I was hanging between life and death,"" he said. 
Several months later doctors removed the upper lobe of his right lung. Today, the 83-year-old pope can be heard breathing heavily after climbing stairs. 
""(The experience) changed my bearings,"" he said. ""For months I didn't know who I was, if I would live or die, even the doctors didn't know. I remember hugging my mother one day and asking her if I was about to die.""
Francis recounts how a nun who worked as nurse helped save his life by secretly doubling the doses of penicillin and streptomycin that a doctor had prescribed.

""Thanks to her regular contact with sick people, she knew what patients needed better than the doctor and had the courage to put that experience to work,"" he said.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>","Exclusive: In latest China jab, U.S. drafts list of 89 firms with military ties","By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - The Trump administration is close to declaring that 89 Chinese aerospace and other companies have military ties, restricting them from buying a range of U.S. goods and technology, according to a draft copy of the list seen by Reuters.
The list, if published, could further escalate trade tensions with Beijing and hurt U.S. companies that sell civil aviation parts and components to China, among other industries.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Commerce, which produced the list, declined to comment. 
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China ""firmly opposes the unprovoked suppression of Chinese companies by the United States.""
What the United States is doing severely violates the principle of market competition and international norms for trade and investment that the U.S. claims to uphold, he added.
Chinese companies have always operated in accordance with the law and strictly follow local laws and regulations when operating overseas, including in the United States, Zhao said.
Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus, is on the list, as is Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and 10 of its related entities. The list is included in a draft rule that identifies Chinese and Russian companies the U.S. considers ""military end users,"" a designation that means U.S. suppliers must seek licenses to sell a broad swath of commercially available items to them. 
According to the rule, applications for such licenses are more likely to be denied than granted. 
U.S President Donald Trump has stepped up his actions in recent months against China. Ten days ago, he unveiled an executive order prohibiting U.S. investments in Chinese companies that Washington says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military. 
The pending list comes after the Commerce Department expanded the definition of ""military end user"" in April. [L2N2CF0JS] The April rule includes not only armed service and national police, but any person or entity that supports or contributes to the maintenance or production of military items -- even if their business is primarily non-military.
The export restriction applies to items as disparate as computer software like word processing, scientific equipment like digital oscilloscopes, and aircraft parts and components. 
In terms of aircraft, the items include everything from brackets for flight control boxes to the engines themselves. 
News of the list comes at a sensitive time for the U.S. aerospace industry as Boeing seeks Chinese approval of its 737 MAX after it was cleared by U.S. regulators last week. In March 2019, China was the first nation to ground the jet following two fatal crashes and it is already expected to wait months to lift the ban. A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment.
Washington trade lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce official, said Commerce had shared the draft rule with a technical advisory committee of industry representatives, and it should have been kept confidential.
Wolf said the rule and list still could be modified and that the clock was running out for it to go into effect under the Trump administration since it would need to be cleared and sent to the Federal Register, the official U.S. publication for rules, by mid-December. 
In the draft rule seen by Reuters, the Commerce Department said being able to control the flow of U.S. technology to the listed companies was ""vital for protecting U.S. national security interests"".
But a former U.S. official who did not want to be identified, said ""merely creating a list and populating it is a provocative act."" An aerospace industry source said it could spur China to retaliate. 
The inclusion of COMAC would come as a surprise to at least one major U.S. supplier, which had determined the company was not a military end user, the industry source said. 
A list also would provide European competitors with an opening to promote their manufacturers, by pointing out they do not have to clear such hurdles, even if the U.S. grants the licenses, the industry source said.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and Honeywell International (NYSE:HON), both supply COMAC and have joint ventures with AVIC.
A GE spokesperson said its global joint ventures operate in compliance with all laws, and that the company has worked to obtain licenses related to military end users. 
A Honeywell spokeswoman declined to comment.
Besides the 89 Chinese listings, the draft rule also designates 28 Russian entities, including Irkut, which is also aiming to break into Boeing's market with its MC-21 jetliner development. 

The 117-company list is ""not exhaustive,"" the draft rule said, and is considered an ""initial tranche.""

Thousands took to the streets of the Belarusian capital Minsk on Sunday, with police using stun grenades to disperse the crowd.

Opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko have staged regular protests since August, accusing him of rigging the election to extend his 26-year grip on power. He denies electoral fraud and has refused to resign.

Politicians in Japan are strictly forbidden to give anything to constituents that could be construed as a gift. The rule is so strict that one cabinet minister quit in 2014 after distributing paper fans during the summer. 
In May, about 660 lawyers and scholars filed a complaint with Tokyo prosecutors seeking an investigation into whether Abe and two executives of his political support group broke campaign and funding laws by subsidising the attendance of backers at the reception in 2018, Kyodo news agency then reported.
Abe has denied any wrongdoing. 
NHK said Tokyo prosecutors had questioned one of Abe's aides and some others on a voluntary basis as part of their investigation. 
Reuters' calls to Abe's offices in Tokyo and in his constituency of Shimonoseki in western Japan went unanswered on Monday, a public holiday in Japan. 
But Kyodo news agency said Abe's office issued a statement saying that it was cooperating with the prosecutors' investigation. 
No one was immediately available for comment at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office or at the Hotel New Otani, where the reception was held in 2018. 
Attendees each paid a 5,000 yen ($48) admission fee for the annual party, but opposition lawmakers said the admission price was much lower than that of other receptions held at the upscale hotel. 

Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, stepped down in September due to health problems, but has stayed on as a lower house lawmaker.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss voters decide on Sunday whether to ban the funding of arms makers, the latest anti-military referendum in the neutral country that hasn't fought an external war for 200 years.
Swiss banks have given loans and hold shares worth nearly $11 billion in companies like  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT),  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), according to a study by independent researchers Profundo.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB), UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) have the biggest exposure, the study said.
""An enormous amount of money comes from Switzerland into an industry which profits from death and destruction,"" said Julia Kueng, co-president of the Young Greens Party.
""How can a country which claims to be neutral profit from war material?""
Campaigners have gathered 120,000 signatures, triggering the referendum.
The SNB opposed the initiative, which it said would create legal uncertainty and undermine the central bank's independence. UBS also rejected it, saying it did not directly or indirectly finance weapons already banned in Switzerland.
Credit Suisse referred Reuters to the Swiss Bankers Association. The association said the initiative would weaken Switzerland as a business location and unnecessarily restrict the SNB, pension funds, banks and insurance companies.
'NAIVE AND IRRESPONSIBLE'
The Initiative Against the War Trade wants to ban the SNB and pension funds from holding shares in companies which generate more than 5% of sales from weapons and components. It would ban banks from lending to defence companies.
The vote is the latest to question Swiss links to the military. In 1989 voters rejected abolishing its army, while six years ago they turned down buying Gripen fighter jets.
The Group for Switzerland without an Army (GSoA) argues a proliferation of weapons fuels wars, and Switzerland could contribute to demilitarization through its outsized wealth management industry.
""These weapons have to be financed,"" GSoA secretary Nadia Kuhn said. ""The banks in Switzerland manage about one quarter of global assets managed across borders. This gives Switzerland an opportunity to make a difference.""
As well as investing in foreign companies, Switzerland also produces arms, and some companies will get loans from banks. Switzerland exported weapons worth 727.9 million Swiss francs to 71 countries in 2019, up from 510 million francs in 2018.
Switzerland bans the production and sale of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as well as land mines and cluster munitions.
Industry group Swissmem estimates around 3,000 companies employing 50,000 people could be affected by the initiative, which it opposes. The Swiss government is also against it.
A poll this month showed 50% of respondents in favour and 45% against.
Maja Riniker, MP for the conservative FDP party, called the referendum ""naive and irresponsible.
""Of course, we would all want to have a totally peaceful world. But this initiative wouldn't achieve that – no other countries are doing it. Instead this would lead to companies taking production out of Switzerland.""
Among the companies affected would be Casram, which gets around 15% of its sales from the defence industry, selling parts to Saab for use in Gripen airframes.

""You cannot survive in Switzerland making just simple products, you need to make more complex articles,"" said Chief Executive Franco Puffi. ""If we lose this market it's like cutting our legs off.""

397,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 03:21AM ET</span>",Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong detained for 2019 illegal assembly,"By Jessie Pang and Joyce Zhou
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was remanded in custody on Monday after pleading guilty to charges of organising and inciting an unauthorised assembly near the police headquarters during last year's anti-government protests.
Wong, who was just 17 years old when he became the face of the 2014 student-led Umbrella Movement democracy protests, faces a maximum three-year jail term. The sentence will be delivered by Dec 2 at 2.30 p.m. (0630 GMT)
Before being taken away by security staff, Wong shouted ""Everyone hang in there! Add oil"" in the courtroom, using a popular Cantonese expression of encouragement often used during protests.
On Twitter afterwards, Wong said attention should be directed to the 12 Hong Kong people detained virtually incommunicado in China after being arrested at sea in August as they were attempting to flee by boat to Taiwan to escape charges related to last year's protests in the city.
""I wish to pay tributes to our fellow activists who are about to face trials and prison, or ... (are) in distress for not being able to return home: We're not fearless, but you are the braver ones,"" he said.
""What we are doing now is to explain the value of freedom to the world,"" Wong added. ""I'm still learning to conquer the fear and I believe you are with me along this journey.""
Wong did not plead guilty to a third charge of knowingly participating in an unauthorised assembly after the prosecution offered no evidence for it.
His long-time activist colleagues Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam, who also pleaded guilty for similar charges, were remanded in custody at the same trial.
Dozens of supporters outside the court chanted pro-democracy slogans and ""Release Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, Ivan Lam!""
Wong was not a leading figure in last year's pro-democracy and anti-China protests, but his continued activism has drawn the wrath of Beijing, which sees him as a ""black hand"" of foreign forces.
He disbanded his pro-democracy group Demosisto in June, just hours after China's parliament passed a sweeping national security law for Hong Kong, punishing anything Beijing considers to be subversion, secessionism, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison.
Wong also faces charges of participating in an unauthorised assembly in October 2019 and on June 4, 2020 over a vigil commemorating the crackdown on protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Earlier this year, Wong was disqualified along 11 other pro-democracy politicians and activists from running in a since-postponed election for the city's legislature.
Wong spent five weeks in jail last year for contempt of court, before being released on June 16 when protests were already in full swing.
Wong's and other activists' repeated arrests have drawn criticism from Western governments who say China is not fulfilling its obligation to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, agreed with former colonial master Britain when the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

China denies the accusation and says Hong Kong is its internal affair.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A row over a Thai woman who held up a placard alleging sexual abuse in schools has put a spotlight on harassment in the education system even as she draws threats of legal action for misrepresentation and attacks for soiling Thailand's image.
The issue is the latest on which discussion has become more vocal as an anti-government protest movement seeking reform of the monarchy also emboldens people in a society where conservatism has often constrained criticism of the powerful.
""I hope my case will raise awareness for people in society, for students in schools, for adults who send children to schools, for teachers and for the Ministry of Education,"" Nalinrat Tuthubthim, 20, told Reuters.
Nalinrat, now a university student, had made allegations on social media of being sexually harassed at school several years ago.
But she grabbed attention at the weekend when she dressed in a high-school uniform at a protest in Bangkok, put black tape over her mouth and held up a placard that read: ""I have been sexually abused by teachers. School is not a safe place.""
Detractors criticised her for not being a real high-school student and she was bombarded with abusive messages. Some shared screengrabs of her Instagram account showing recent pictures in which she had modelled revealing outfits.
""When a non-student wears school uniform, when you draw this much attention from society and from social media, you need to take responsibility for it and what follows,"" said Pareena Kraikupt, a member of parliament for the Palang Pracharat Party of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.
Pareena told Reuters she was planning to file a police complaint against Nalinrat for wearing a school uniform when she was not a school student, but also to call for a police investigation into her former school over the alleged harassment. 
Senator Somchai Sawangkarn condemned Nalinrat for damaging Thailand's image and said she should be punished if an investigation of her accusations found them to be untrue.
Nalinrat said it was their right to criticise and take legal action but she would defend herself.
BIGGER MESSAGE
While she has faced thousands of negative comments on social media, her supporters have argued that the message should not get lost in the questions over whether she chose the right form of protest.
""Successive governments have promised to make schools safe for children but little has been done in reality to end sexual harassment and other abuses,"" said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.
""Children refuse to be silently submissive in the face of an education system that fails to protect them,"" he told Reuters.
When asked for comment on the allegations of harassment, an official at the education ministry noted that this year it had established a Student Protection Center to tackle sexual harassment and set up a committee to investigate reports of it.
In a high-profile case in March, a teacher was put under investigation after students accused him of molesting students in exchange for better grades.
But student groups say the problem is far more widespread, both in school and beyond.
Alongside the broader demands of the youth-led protest movement, students are also campaigning for greater freedom and gender equality in schools they say are designed to instil archaic principles of obedience rather than to educate.
A YouGov poll in 2019 found that one in five Thais had experienced sexual harassment, with men almost as likely to face it as women. The most common form of sexual harassment was sexual assault - reported by 44% of those who had suffered harassment. Only 10% said they reported incidents to police.
""Schools are a place where rates of sexual harassment are high,"" said Bajrasobhin Maneenil of the Feminist's Liberation Front Thailand group. 

""Students have been sexually abused by both teachers and students but schools and this society still do not provide solutions for victims to take legal action or get therapy.""

There was no immediate Saudi confirmation of the claim made by the group's military spokesman, who warned foreign companies and residents in Saudi to exercise caution as ""operations will continue"".
Aramco's oil production and export facilities are mostly in Saudi's Eastern Province, more than 1,000 km across the country from Jeddah.
State oil giant Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A Houthi military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, said the attack was carried out with a Quds-2 type winged missile. 
He also posted a satellite image with the label ""north Jeddah bulk plant-Saudi Aramco"". Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Maps shows a facility matching that image and description on the northern outskirts of Jeddah. 
""The strike was very accurate, and ambulances and fire engines rushed to the target,"" Sarea said.
Yemen has been mired in conflict since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in March 2015 to restore the Yemeni government ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by Houthi forces in late 2014.
Cross-border attacks by Houthi forces have escalated since late May when a truce prompted by the novel coronavirus pandemic expired. The Saudi-led coalition has responded with air strikes on Houthi-held territory. 
The Houthi group controls most of north Yemen and most large urban areas. They say they are fighting a corrupt system. 
Sarea said the strike had been carried out in response to the Saudi-led coalition's actions in Yemen.
Saudi Arabia finished hosting a G20 summit on Sunday.

Several thousands of people took to the streets of Guatemala's capital on Saturday to urge President Alejandro Giammattei to veto the 2021 budget, which will cut funding for healthcare, education and human rights just as the country grapples with the aftermath of two major storms and COVID-19.
Most protestors demonstrated peacefully, but one group torched rooms inside the Congress and others clashed with police, who used tear gas to dispel crowds. Thirty-six people were arrested, and at least a dozen people were taken to hospitals to be treated for injuries. 
""The president expresses his most absolute openness to an inclusive dialogue that will allow an understanding among all sectors of national life,"" Guatemala's government said in a statement.
It said authorities were working on measures that will ""promote dialogue among diverse political forces.""
Guatemala's call for OAS assistance under the Inter-American Democratic Charter (IDC) came after the organisation urged dialogue over the 2021 budget that would take into account the COVID-19 crisis and two recent hurricanes.
The government's statement said violence did not represent a legitimate form of expression, and had left authorities ""no other path than to turn to the international community.""

The G13 group of countries and institutions that provide aid to Guatemala, including the United States, has called for an investigation into Saturday's events.

401,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 22, 2020 09:27PM ET</span>","U.S. Navy Rear Admiral on Surprise Visit to Taiwan, Reuters Says","(Bloomberg) -- A senior U.S. military officer who oversees intelligence gathering for the Indo-Pacific Command made an unannounced visit to Taiwan, Reuters reported, a move that risks further raising tensions between Washington and Beijing.
The visiting official was U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Michael Studeman, Reuters said, citing two unidentified sources. In a statement on Sunday, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said it welcomed the visit of an “unidentified U.S. official” but declined to give more details because the trip “has not been made public.”
A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment when asked about the trip.
The visit is the latest show of support from the outgoing Trump administration, which has sold Taiwan billions of dollars worth of weapons and sent the highest-level delegation to the self-governing democracy in four decades. Taiwanese officials have also said the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could visit Taipei this year.
“This visit could be more symbolic than functional as other interactions between Taipei and Washington would be frequent enough to promote bilateral cooperation,” said Wu Shang-su, a research fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies who previously worked at Taiwan’s National Defense University and the island’s Legislative Yuan.
“Beijing will be naturally unhappy, but the intensity of the response may not be strong, since other high U.S. officials have visited and will visit the island,” he added. “If China remains highly furious on all such interactions, it would become routine.”
U.S. President Donald Trump’s willingness to risk angering Beijing with pro-Taiwan policies, symbolic gestures and high-level visits has boosted his popularity among some democracy advocates in Asia. That represents a challenge to President-elect Joe Biden, who some in Taiwan and Hong Kong fear could take a more conciliatory approach to China.
Beijing, which views Taiwan as its territory, has condemned high-level U.S. visits to Taipei and threatened unspecified sanctions in response to U.S. arms sales, which have included F-16 warplanes, Abrams tanks and anti-ship missiles.

TAIPEI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A two-star Navy admiral overseeing U.S. military intelligence in the Asia-Pacific region has made an unannounced visit to Taiwan, two sources told Reuters on Sunday, in a high-level trip that could vex China.
The sources, who include a Taiwanese official familiar with the situation, said the official was Rear Admiral Michael Studeman. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
According to the Navy's website, Studeman is director of the J2, which oversees intelligence, at the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command.
The Pentagon declined comment, as did Taiwan's Defence Ministry. Taiwan's foreign ministry confirmed on Sunday that a U.S. official had arrived in Taiwan but declined to provide details, saying the trip had not been made public. 
China, which claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, reacted with fury when U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar came to Taipei in August, followed by U.S. Undersecretary of State Keith Krach in September, sending fighter jets near the island each time.
The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan, including with new arms sales, alarming China.
It was not immediately clear whether Studeman's visit would be seen as an escalation by Beijing. Still, he could be one of the most high-ranking U.S. military officers known to have visited Taipei in recent years.
Douglas Paal, a former head of the U.S. representative office in Taiwan who is now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: ""If it is Indopacom J2 Studeman, I know of no precedent for such a visit.""
But Randall Schriver, a former assistant secretary of defense for Asia during the Trump administration, said Trump's Pentagon had been quietly sending one-star flag officers to Taiwan on a routine basis. 
He noted that the United States and Taiwan had close intelligence exchanges on the threat from China's military.
Bonnie Glaser, a regional security expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said it would not be unprecedented for a U.S. flag officer to visit Taipei. 
UNMARKED AIRCRAFT
The Taiwanese and U.S. militaries have a close relationship, though rarely mention those ties in public.
Eric Sayers, who worked as an adviser to former PACOM commander Admiral Harry Harris and is now a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said it was his understanding that two-star officers have visited Taiwan before. 
""However, the goal on both sides has been to keep these military-to-military exchanges discreet, so they can continue on a regularized basis,"" he said. 
Taiwan's United Daily News published pictures of an unmarked private jet, which it identified as being a U.S. military aircraft, arriving at Taipei's downtown Songshan airport, and what appeared to be officials waiting at its VIP terminal.
Data on the flight-tracking website planefinder.net showed a private flight arriving from Hawaii - home to the headquarters of the Indo-Pacific Command - into Songshan airport late Sunday afternoon, shortly before the United Daily News published the pictures on its website.
In a brief statement, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said there were frequent interactions with the United States and that ""we welcome the visit of the U.S. official.""
""But as this itinerary has not been made public, based on mutual trust between Taiwan and the United States, the Foreign Ministry has no further explanation or comment,"" it added.
The de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei declined to comment.
The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is the democratic island's most important international backer and supplier of arms.

Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said last week the cabinet-level head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, will visit Taiwan. U.S. media said that trip is likely next month.

Built in 1955, the boat was once owned by a fisherman who lived on the vessel with his family. It has been used for harbour tours since the 1980s, and the current operator has run the service since 2014. 
Its 12 staff serve mainly foreign tourists looking to see Hong Kong's glitzy skyline from a different angle.
But with the border all but shut for non-residents for roughly the past 10 months, Dukling Limited's director of business development, Charlotte Li, says foreign clients are virtually non-existent.
""This disease has had a massive impact on the entire planet and Hong Kong is really dependent on trade and tourism,” said Li, seated in the wooden boat. 
Visitor arrivals have been down 96-99% year-on-year for every month since February. At its peak Hong Kong received almost 7 million visitors per month.
Still, Li has preserved about a third of the business by offering tours in Cantonese rather than English and sailing to more distant Hong Kong locations to attract more local residents.
“My kids love boats,"" said Edmund Kwok, a 36-year-old engineer, on a tour with his wife and two children. 
Traditional Chinese junk boats were originally used for fishing and transportation. Tourism has prompted more such boats to float across Victoria harbour, but many are believed to be just replicas.

“Every piece of wood and every bit of furniture here has its history,"" Li said of the Dukling.  “This boat really represents Hong Kong.”

China will offer extensive financial and policy support to encourage couples to have more children, the official China Daily cited experts as saying. 
""More inclusive population policies will be introduced to improve fertility, the quality of the workforce and the structure of the population,"" said Yuan Xin, vice-president of the China Population Association. 
China introduced a controversial ""one-child policy"" in 1978, saying efforts to reduce poverty and develop the economy were being undermined by rapid population growth, especially in the countryside. 
But the world's most populous nation decided in 2016 to relax restrictions and allow couples to have a second child in a bid to address the rapid increase in the elderly as well as a dwindling workforce. Some experts say it should now scrap all limits entirely. 
The number of citizens aged 60 or over stood at 254 million at the end of last year, accounting for 18.1% of the population. The number is expected to rise to 300 million by 2025 and 400 million by 2035, putting huge pressure on the country's health and social care system, demographers say.
Demographers also predict that on current trends, the number of people of working age could decline by 200 million by 2050.
Despite the relaxation of the one-child policy in 2016, the number of live births per 1,000 people fell to a record low of 10.48 last year, down from 10.94 in 2018. 
Policies aimed at suppressing population growth must be replaced by a system designed to boost fertility, the official Legal Daily said, citing government experts.

""To proactively tackle the ageing population, urgent measures are required to reform our country's family planning policies and liberate fertility,"" said Zheng Bingwen, an expert with the China Academy of Social Science.

Police detained more than a dozen people for attempting to protest while security forces prevented around a dozen more from leaving their homes in the first place, according to exiled rights group Cubalex. 
The Reuters eyewitness saw police arrest at least one young man after a mob chased him down as he ran across the park waving a sign, pushing and shoving him into a nearby building.
The mob surrounded, chased, pushed and punched another young man and woman, with police and other security personnel doing little if anything to stop them.
The rabble then turned on credentialed foreign journalists filming the story, pushing, shoving and punching one cameraman four or five times in the body.
The protest had been called in support of a group of activists who say they have gone on a hunger strike to protest authorities' attempts to prevent them from publicly demonstrating against the imprisonment of a fellow member on charges of contempt.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the claims and could not access their headquarters due to security forces blocking off the street. One state official said access was restricted due to a coronavirus outbreak. 
A number of international human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have denounced authorities' treatment of the activists who have had numerous run-ins with the state in recent years as they protest curbs on freedom of speech. 
The Cuban government dismisses dissidents as mercenaries seeking to destabilize the country and did not reply to request for comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy goes on trial on Monday accused of trying to bribe a judge and of influence-peddling, one of several criminal investigations that threaten to cast an ignominious pall over his decades-long political career.
Prosecutors allege Sarkozy offered to secure a plum job in Monaco for judge Gilbert Azibert in return for confidential information about an inquiry into claims that Sarkozy had accepted illegal payments from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign.
Sarkozy, who led France from 2007-2012 and has remained influential among conservatives, has denied any wrongdoing in all the investigations against him and fought vigorously to have the cases dismissed.
Investigators had from 2013 been wiretapping conversations between Sarkozy and his lawyer Thierry Herzog as they delved into allegations of Libyan financing in Sarkozy's 2007 campaign.
As they did, they learned that Sarkozy and his lawyer were communicating using mobile phones registered under false names. Sarkozy's phone was registered to a Paul Bismuth.
Prosecutors have said the wiretaps revealed that Sarkozy and Herzog had on multiple occasions discussed contacting Azibert, a magistrate at the Cour de Cassation, France's top appeals court for criminal cases, and well-informed on the Bettencourt inquiry. 
They allege that Sarkozy offered to help Azibert get the Monaco job in return for insider help.
""Mr Azibert never got the job in Monaco,"" Sarkozy told BFM TV this month.
Herzog and Azibert are both on trial with Sarkozy, charged with corruption and influence-peddling. They are also accused of ""violating professional secrecy"". All three face up to 10 years in prison and hefty fines if convicted.
Sarkozy and his centre-right party Les Republicains have for years said the investigations against the former president are politically motivated. 
Next March, Sarkozy is due in court on accusations of violating campaign financing rules during his failed 2012 re-election bid. The so-called ""Bygmalion"" case centres on accusations that Sarkozy's party worked with a friendly public relations firm to hide the true cost of his campaign.

Prosecutors are still investigating claims that Libya's former leader Muammar Gaddafi provided Sarkozy’s 2007 campaign with millions of euros shipped to Paris in suitcases - allegations that Sarkozy denies. His main accuser, a French-Lebanese businessman, withdrew his account of events this month.

The face-to-face survey of 1,000 Mexicans between Nov. 12-18 by polling firm Buendia & Laredo showed Lopez Obrador had the support of 64%, bolstered by his social spending programs. Just 25% disapproved of him, according to the poll.
The rating was up from the 59% he scored in the pollster's prior August telephone survey, reaching the highest level since November 2019 - well before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 100,000 people in Mexico.
Lopez Obrador is gearing up for mid-term elections due on June 6, 2021, which will determine whether he can retain control of the lower house of Congress.
Failure to hold the lower house could do significant damage to his efforts to roll back the last government's liberalization of the energy market. He argues that has been a rip-off for taxpayers, sparking conflict with foreign investors in Mexico.
Easily the most popular of the president's policies cited by respondents were welfare spending schemes which target the elderly, students and poorer rural areas, the survey showed.
""The social programs are his anchor,"" said Jorge Buendia, head of the polling firm.
Lopez Obrador's popularity stands in defiance of his overall record on the economy and security, where he has fallen short of the goals he set himself upon taking office two years ago. 
Mexico's economy slipped into recession months before the pandemic even began, while murders hit record levels last year. This year they are on track to hit another record.

While Mexicans still support his handling of the pandemic, they are becoming more skeptical about it, the poll showed.

In a statement, the ministry said its legal and technical departments were analyzing the documents presented by the five entities and determining the best way to go about purchasing vaccines at ""the opportune moment.""
The government has contracts in place to guarantee access to 142,900,000 coronavirus vaccine doses, enough to immunize at least a third of Brazil's population, officials said in the statement. 
So far, the Brazilian federal government's main bet is on a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC, with which it has already signed a supply contract.

Quinn, who was born and grew up in Yonkers, New York, was co-founder of the campaign that raised more than $220 million for medical research into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, his Facebook page said.
He was diagnosed with ALS on March 8, 2013, according to his Facebook page.
""It is with great sadness that we must share the passing of Patrick early this morning,"" his supporters said on Facebook. ""We will always remember him for his inspiration and courage in his tireless fight against ALS.""
Condolences to the Quinn family poured in on social media, with many expressing gratitude for the spotlight he drew to the disease and the need to find a cure. 
The Ice Bucket Challenge went viral on social media in the summer of 2014, when people around the world posted videos and photos of themselves dumping buckets of ice water on their heads and challenging others to do the same while urging donations for ALS research. 
Roughly 12,000 to 15,000 Americans may have ALS, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An estimated 5% to 10% of ALS cases are believed to be hereditary, but the cause is unknown and there is no cure.

Among Quinn's many honors for raising awareness of ALS and promoting research was a nomination with fellow ALS activist Peter Frates as ""Person of the Year"" by Time magazine. Frates died last year at age 34, seven years after his diagnosis.

The sources, who include a Taiwanese official familiar with the situation, said the official was Rear Admiral Michael Studeman. They were speaking on condition of anonymity. According to the Navy's website, Studeman is director of the J2, which oversees intelligence, at the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command.
The Pentagon, asked whether Studeman was visiting Taiwan, declined to comment. China claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory. The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan, including with new arms sales and high-level visits.

The leftist president has warned against taking on debt and bailing out companies, even as Mexico's economy is set to contract 10% this year, its worst slump since the Great Depression. 
""Our proposal consists in ... making a reality the commitment to remove sums of debt and debt-servicing to the poor nations of the world,"" Lopez Obrador said in a video as part of the G20 summit. 
He also urged fellow leaders to ""guarantee that middle-income countries can access credit at interest rates equivalent to the current ones in developed countries.""
On Saturday, the World Bank president had warned G20 leaders that failing to provide more permanent debt relief could lead to increased poverty and a repeat of the disorderly defaults of the 1980s. 
With interest rates in the United States and Europe already close to zero, Lopez Obrador is likely aiming to rally support for extending loans on similarly favorable terms for developing countries, said economist Jose Luis de la Cruz, director of the Institute for Industrial Development and Economic Growth. 
Lopez Obrador also said Mexico's economy is meeting the government's expectation of V-shaped recovery, and projected that by next March the number of formal jobs will bounce back to 20.5 million, the amount before the pandemic hit.

Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he would rejoin the accord if Tehran first resumed strict compliance, and would work with allies ""to strengthen and extend it, while more effectively pushing back against Iran's other destabilising activities"".
The agreement, which world powers reached with Iran, sought to limit Tehran's nuclear programme to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons in return for the easing of economic sanctions.
But the deal, abandoned by Trump in 2018, did not restrict Iran's ballistic missile programme nor its support for militia in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, which Washington sees as destabilising to the Middle East.
""There must be no return to the previous nuclear agreement. We must stick to an uncompromising policy to ensure that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons,"" Netanyahu said in a speech in southern Israel.
He did not mention Biden directly, but his comments were widely interpreted by Israeli media as a message to the incoming president not to bring the United States back into the agreement.
Netanyahu was a strong opponent of the 2015 accord, calling it a ""very bad deal"" in an address that year to the U.S. Congress that further strained his relationship with Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.
European powers party to the agreement, along with Russia and China, have been trying to hold the deal together despite U.S. pressure for sweeping sanctions against Iran over breaches it declared in response to Washington's pullout.

Iran denies that its atomic programme is aimed at developing weapons.

""We see ourselves as an inseparable part of Europe...However this does not mean that we will bow down to overt attacks to our country and nation, veiled injustices and double standards,"" Erdogan said in a speech to the members of its AK Party.
Turkey's drilling activities in a disputed part of the eastern Mediterranean have raised tensions with the EU as Turkey locked in a dispute with and Greece and Cyprus over the extent of their continental shelves and hydrocarbon resources.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said this month that Turkey's rhetoric on Cyprus was aggravating tensions with the EU and Ankara had to understand that its behaviour was ""widening its separation"" from the bloc.
The EU will discuss Turkey's pursuit of natural gas exploration in contested waters in the eastern Mediterranean at their next summit in December, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday.
""We do not believe that we have any problems with countries or institutions that cannot be solved through politics, dialogue and negotiations,"" Erdogan said.
Erdogan, connected to the event through videolink, said that the EU should keep its promises regarding the migrants issue and making Turkey a full member of the bloc. He was referring to a 2016 deal under which Ankara curbed migrant entries into Europe in exchange for financial help and visa-free travel in the Schengen region.

Turkey recently extended the seismic survey work being carried out by its Oruc Reis ship in a disputed part of the eastern Mediterranean until Nov. 29, according to a naval notice.

The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which is refusing to surrender its rule of the northern region, said its forces were digging trenches and standing firm. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's federal troops have taken a string of towns during aerial bombardments and ground fighting, and are now aiming for Mekelle, a highland city of about 500,000 people where the rebels are based.
The war has killed hundreds, possibly thousands, sent more than 30,000 refugees into neighbouring Sudan, and seen rockets fired by rebels into neighbouring Amhara region and across the border into the nation of Eritrea. 
Foreign nations have urged talks, but Abiy has pressed on with the offensive since Nov. 4. 
Reuters could not confirm the latest statements on the war. Claims by all sides are hard to verify because phone and internet communication has been down. 
'NO MERCY'
""The next phases are the decisive part of the operation, which is to encircle Mekelle using tanks,"" military spokesman Colonel Dejene Tsegaye told state-run Ethiopia Broadcasting Corporation.
""We want to send a message to the public in Mekelle to save yourselves from any artillery attacks and free yourselves from the junta ... After that, there will be no mercy.""
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters by text message that his forces were resisting a push from the south while also fighting near the northern town of Adigrat after it fell to federal troops.
""Encircling Mekelle is their plan but yet they couldn't,"" he said. ""On south front, they couldn't move an inch for more than one week. They (are) sending waves after waves but to no avail."" 
Abiy accuses the Tigrayan leaders of revolting against central authority and starting the conflict by attacking federal troops in the town of Dansha. The rebels say his government has marginalised Tigrayans since taking office two years ago, removing them from senior roles in government and the military and detaining many on rights abuse and corruption charges.
ARRESTS
The prime minister drew plaudits for opening up Ethiopia's closed economy and repressive political system after taking office. However, rights groups say his government has carried out mass arrests after outbreaks of violence and detained journalists this year.
Abiy won a Nobel Peace Prize last year for ending a two-decade standoff with Eritrea. The awarding committee in Oslo last week made a rare foray into the activities of laureates by urging peace in Tigray. 
Redwan Hussein, spokesman for the government's taskforce on Tigray, said there was still time for TPLF leaders to surrender. ""The government will take maximum restraint not to cause major risks for civilians,"" he added. 
While many Tigrayan special forces and militiamen had surrendered or scattered around Adigrat, resistance was stronger on the southern front, Redwan said, where rebels have dug up roads, destroyed bridges and booby-trapped roads. 

The taskforce added that the army had also taken the small town of Idaga Hamus on the road from Adigrat to Mekelle.

Thousands of people took to the streets of Belarusian capital and police used stun grenades to disperse the crowd, several Belarus media outlets reported.
The Vesna-96 rights group said 70 people had been detained so far.
Opponents have staged regular protests since August, accusing President Alexander Lukashenko of rigging the election to extend his 26-year grip on power. He denies electoral fraud and has refused to resign. 
Protest organisers this week asked people to gather in dozens of different spots all across Minsk before forming bigger groups, to make it more difficult for police to control the crowd.
The street rallies were re-ignited following the death of a 31-year old anti-government protester Roman Bondarenko, who died in hospital earlier this month following what demonstrators said was a severe beating by security forces.

The interior ministry denied responsibility for Bondarenko's death, saying he was killed in a scuffle with civilians.

Htike Zaw was shot at the shop he ran at his house in the town of Kyaukme on Saturday, said party spokesman Myo Nyunt. 
The dead man had won a seat in a Nov. 8 general election that brought a landslide victory for the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD).
“He went outside to sell as a customer arrived, and that customer shot him,” Myo Nyunt told Reuters by telephone, adding that the party had asked authorities to investigate as soon as possible.
“We denounce violence, especially violence related to politics which is bad for the future,” he said.
Local police did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
The election was only the second held in Myanmar since the end of half a century of military and military-backed rule in 2011, and Aung San Suu’s NLD won a resounding victory.
The party won fewer seats than other parties in some ethnic areas including Shan state, a region ravaged by conflict with insurgents and large-scale drug production. Voting in some constituencies in the state was cancelled before the election, with authorities citing violence.
The army-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party has challenged the result of the polls, alleging irregularities from poor-quality ballot boxes to advanced voting problems, and demanded a re-run.
The NLD has called for evidence of wrongdoing.
The result in Htike Zaw's constituency, a seat previously held by an ethnic Shan party but won by the NLD in November, is among those being disputed, Myo Nyunt said, without giving further details.
The house of an election commission official in Kyaukme was attacked earlier this month.

Israel, which views Tehran as its biggest security threat, has repeatedly attacked Iranian targets and those of allied militia in Syria, where Tehran has backed President Bashar al-Assad and his forces against rebels and militants since 2012.
On Wednesday, an Israeli military spokesman said eight targets were attacked, including an Iranian headquarters at Damascus international airport and a ""secret military site"" that served as a ""hosting facility for senior Iranian delegations when they come to Syria to operate"".
Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khateebzadeh told a virtual weekly news conference: ""The Zionist regime (Israel) is well aware that the era of hit and run is over and therefore they are very cautious.""
Iran denies having military forces in Syria and says it has sent commandos to the country as military advisers. Tehran says it will provide military advisers to Syria for as long as necessary. 
""Iran's presence in Syria is advisory and naturally if anyone disrupts this advisory presence, our response will be a crushing one,"" Khatibzadeh said. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said at least 10 people, including five Iranians from the Quds Force, a branch of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards responsible for operations outside of Iran’s own borders, were killed during the attack. 

""I do not confirm the martyrdom of Iranian forces in Syria,"" ""Khatibzadeh said.

The comments posted on Twitter by Pakistan's Federal Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari on Saturday came as part of a clash between Pakistan and France over the publication of images of the Prophet Mohammad by a French magazine. The images have sparked anger and protests in the Muslim world, especially in Pakistan.
""Macron is doing to Muslims what the Nazis did to the Jews - Muslim children will get ID numbers (other children won't) just as Jews were forced to wear the yellow star on their clothing for identification,"" Mazari said in a tweet linking to an online article.
In a follow-up tweet on Sunday, Mazari doubled down on her claims following a condemnation by France's foreign ministry late on Saturday. 
""These hateful words are blatant lies, imbued with an ideology of hatred and violence. Such slander is unworthy of this level of responsibility. We reject them with the greatest firmness,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said, adding that Paris had informed the Pakistan embassy of its strong condemnation of the comments. 
""Pakistan must rectify these remarks and return to the path of a dialogue based on respect.""
Pakistan's parliament at the end of October passed a resolution urging the government to recall its envoy from Paris, accusing Macron of ""hate-mongering"" against Muslims.
Macron had paid tribute to a French history teacher who was beheaded by an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a class on freedom of speech.
French officials have said the beheading was an assault on the core French value of freedom of expression.

After satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo re-published the cartoons in September, Macron said the freedom to blaspheme went hand in hand with the freedom of belief in France.

Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), rallied its supporters to join the march for the first time, having mounted an increasingly strident campaign against the pork decision, which it says threatens food safety.
President Tsai Ing-wen announced in August that the government would, from Jan. 1, allow imports of U.S. pork containing ractopamine, an additive that enhances leanness but is banned in the European Union and China, as well as U.S. beef more than 30 months old. 
While welcomed in Washington, and removing a roadblock to a long sought after U.S. free trade deal for Taiwan, the KMT has strongly opposed the decision, tapping into public concern about food safety after several high-profile scandals in recent years.
KMT Chairman Johnny Chiang, elected in March to help turn around party fortunes after a trouncing in January's presidential and parliamentary elections, called on Tsai to take part in a televised debate on the issue.
""Taiwanese pigs don't eat ractopamine and yet you are asking Taiwanese people to? Does this make sense?"" he told supporters.
Tsai's government and her ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), which has a large majority in parliament, says the decision brings the island into line with international norms, is not a safety threat and will boost Taiwan-U.S. ties.
In a statement on Sunday, the DPP urged the KMT to ""stop its political machinations and return to rational discussions"".
The DPP, which had previously voiced strong objections to ractopamine, has accused the KMT of spreading fake news about the subject in an effort to sow public fear.

The KMT is also trying to organise a referendum on the U.S. pork imports.

On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron will give a speech to the nation about the virus situation and may announce a partial relaxation of restrictions which have been in place since Oct. 30.
""Emmanuel Macron will give prospects over several weeks, especially on how we adjust our strategy. What is at stake is adapting lockdown rules as the health situation improves while avoiding a new flare up in the epidemic,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal told Le Journal Du Dimanche.
""There will be three steps to (lockdown) easing in view of the health situation and of risks tied to some businesses: a first step around Dec. 1, then before the year-end holidays, and then from January 2021,"" Attal added.
Macron has said that France's second national lockdown, which started on Oct. 30, would last at least four weeks. Curbs include the closure of non-essential stores, restaurants and bars.
But with recent data showing France on track to rein in a surge in coronavirus infections, the government is under pressure from shops and businesses to ease restrictions in time for the Christmas shopping season, when many retailers make the bulk of their annual turnover.
""We had committed to allow them (shopkeepers) to reopen around Dec. 1 if the health situation improved, which seems to be the case,"" Attal said.
Bars and restaurants however ""will continue to experience restrictions,"" he added.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China plans to launch an unmanned spacecraft to the moon this week to bring back lunar rocks in the first attempt by any nation to retrieve samples from Earth's natural satellite since the 1970s.
The Chang'e-5 probe, named after the ancient Chinese goddess of the moon, will seek to collect material that can help scientists understand more about the moon's origins and formation. The mission will test China's ability to remotely acquire samples from space, ahead of more complex missions.
If successful, the mission will make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples, following the United States and the Soviet Union decades ago.
Since the Soviet Union crash-landed the Luna 2 on the moon in 1959, the first human-made object to reach another celestial body, a handful of other countries including Japan and India have launched moon missions.
In the Apollo programme, which first put men on the moon, the United States landed 12 astronauts over six flights from 1969 to 1972, bringing back 382 kg (842 pounds) of rocks and soil. 
The Soviet Union deployed three successful robotic sample return missions in the 1970s. The last, the Luna 24, retrieved 170.1 grams (6 ounces) of samples in 1976 from Mare Crisium, or ""Sea of Crises"". 
China's probe, scheduled to launch in coming days, will attempt to collect 2 kg (4 1/2 pounds) of samples in a previously unvisited area in a massive lava plain known as Oceanus Procellarum, or ""Ocean of Storms"". 
""The Apollo-Luna sample zone of the moon, while critical to our understanding, was undertaken in an area that comprises far less than half the lunar surface,"" said James Head, a planetary scientist at Brown University.
Subsequent data from orbital remote sensing missions have shown a wider diversity of rock types, mineralogies and ages than represented in the Apollo-Luna sample collections, he said.
""Lunar scientists have been advocating for robotic sample return missions to these many different critical areas in order to address a host of fundamental questions remaining from earlier exploration,"" Head said.
The Chang'e-5 mission may help answer questions such as how long the moon remained volcanically active in its interior and when its magnetic field - key to protecting any form of life from the sun's radiation - dissipated. 
THE MISSION
Once in the moon's orbit, the probe will aim to deploy a pair of vehicles to the surface: a lander will drill into the ground, then transfer its soil and rock samples to an ascender that will lift off and dock with an orbiting module. 
If this is successful, the samples will be transferred to a return capsule that will return them to Earth. 
China made its first lunar landing in 2013. In January 2019, the Chang'e-4 probe touched down on the far side of the moon, the first by any nation's space probe.
Within the next decade, China plans to establish a robotic base station to conduct unmanned exploration in the south polar region. 
It is to be developed through the Chang'e-6，7 and 8 missions through the 2020s and expanded through the 2030s ahead of manned landings. 
China plans to retrieve samples from Mars by 2030.

In July, China launched an unmanned probe to Mars in its first independent mission to another planet.

There were no casualties reported on either side of the border. Israeli police said the Gaza rocket fired on Saturday night damaged a factory in the southern city of Ashkelon. 
The Israeli military said its aircraft struck in response against several military sites belonging to Hamas, the Islamist armed group that controls Gaza. 
Reuters witnesses said the pre-dawn strikes hit targets in Gaza City and the southern Gaza cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, where flames and plumes of smoke could be seen rising from some sites.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility from any of Gaza's military groups for firing the rocket. Israel and Hamas last fought a war in 2014 and have exchanged fire several times since, though the border has been largely quiet in recent months.
""The Hamas terror organization is responsible for all events transpiring in the Gaza Strip and emanating from it, and will bear the consequences for terror activity against Israeli civilians,"" the military said in a statement.
In Gaza Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum blamed the new escalation on Israel.
""The Israeli occupation is the prime responsible for everything that happens in Gaza as it continues to blockade it and carry out attacks. The resistance is only acting in self-defence,"" Barhoum told Reuters.

Ministers from about 70 countries and officials of humanitarian organisations, at the virtual conference hosted in Geneva on Monday and Tuesday, are expected to pledge billions of dollars to safeguard development projects, with talks between the Afghan government and Taliban rebels stalled and President Trump sharply reducing U.S. forces in the country.
Although the fragile economy depends heavily on foreign aid, Kabul will see cuts in donations, and donors will introduce stringent political and human rights conditions on the money, five participants told Reuters.
Afghanistan's economy is set to contract by at least 5.5%this year because of COVID-19 impacts, stated the World Bank in a recent report. 
The strategy aims to protect the peace talks and prod the Afghan government to improve allocation, they said. 
Donors at the last conference, in Brussels in 2016, pledged $15.2 billion for 2017 to 2020, or $3.8 billion a year.
That could be cut by 15% to 20%, said a senior Western diplomat participating in the conference. ""This is the best countries can offer amid the domestic challenge of managing a pandemic.""
Trump will cut U.S. forces in Afghanistan to 2,500 from 4,500 by mid-January, the Pentagon said last week, seeking to wind down America's longest war. The drawdown of foreign forces - Britain plans to follow the U.S. lead - could mean greater influence for the Taliban.
This makes donors uneasy over whether the hardline Islamists will try to roll back progress on human rights and girls' education.
The peace talks in the Qatari capital Doha have stalled and the Taliban refuses to call a ceasefire. Its attacks have sometimes prompted U.S. airstrikes to protect urban areas. 
But senior diplomats told Reuters that a breakthrough was expected in the peace talks after the donor conference.
""Taliban and Afghan government representatives will take a break from the peace talks after the Geneva conference but not before they have joint declaration of agreement over key security issues,"" said a senior Western official.
At the Geneva meeting, the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani will present a peace and development framework meant to allocate funds to key projects, safeguard millions of jobs and protect democratic institutions.
""The conference will remain focused on making Afghanistan self-reliant by the end of its transformation decade which is 2024,"" Naser Sidiqee, a senior official of the Afghan finance ministry, said in Geneva last week.
The Taliban is not invited to the conference but the militants have urged donors to continue their humanitarian assistance while accusing Ghani's government of pocketing the aid money. 
""We request the international community and organisations to deliver aid, collected in the name of the people, to the people,"" the Islamist group said in a statement.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Thousands of people on Saturday staged the biggest protest yet against Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, with some setting fire to Congress, fuelled by anger over cuts in the 2021 budget just as the country reels from back to back storms. 
Waving Guatemalan flags and signs declaring ""Giammattei, resign,"" demonstrators called for Giammattei to veto the budget, which lawmakers approved at dawn last Wednesday even as Hurricane Iota was drenching parts of the Central American country still grappling with the destruction of a prior storm. 
At 99.7 billion quetzals ($12.9 billion), the budget increased public debt while cutting funding for healthcare, education, human rights and the justice system, outraging people from students to business leaders in a year marked by the economic crisis of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Congress allocated more money for their meals and didn't allocate money to the poor people,"" said Diego Herrera, 25, a student. 
While most protesters assembled peacefully at the main square, others smashed the windows of the Congress building and set fire to the interior, sending columns of orange flames rippling out, social media and Reuters images show. A cloud of grey smoke could be seen blocks away.
A spokeswoman for San Juan de Dios General Hospital, one of the capital's biggest hospitals, said it was treating 14 people for multiple injuries and tear gas poisoning, after clashes with police in riot gear who used tear gas to disperse the crowds. 
Twenty-two people were arrested, a court spokesman said.
Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, urged investigations into the detentions, which social media videos showed as violent.
""Multiple complaints of mistreatment, excessive use of force, indiscriminate use of tear gas by the Guatemalan police,"" she wrote on Twitter.
Giammattei had told national television on Friday he would meet with ""whomever necessary"" to explain the budget. As protests ramped up Saturday, he said on Twitter he was meeting with various sectors to analyze modifications to the budget. He did not provide details. 
Giammattei's own vice president, Guillermo Castillo, opposed the budget plan and has suggested both men resign.
Giammattei took office in January, shortly before the pandemic hit, forcing lockdown measures that crimped the already weak economy. 

In November, two fierce hurricanes - Eta followed just two weeks later by Iota - killed 60 people with many more missing, and destroyed crops that had sustained tens of thousands of families.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's top military official said on Sunday the country's defense force must 'own' a recent report on soldiers committing crimes in Afghanistan and pledged changes to ensure that atrocities do not happen again.
The report, published on Thursday after an inquiry into the conduct of special forces personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, found that senior commandos forced junior soldiers to kill defenseless captives in order to ""blood"" them for combat..
Defense Force Chief General Angus Campbell said on Sunday he would be held to account to ensure the report was dealt with thoroughly, as well as for duty and performance as the commander in the Middle East in 2011.
""I want the ADF (Australia Defense Force) to acknowledge that this is something we've got to own because if we don't own it, we won't fix it and if we don't fix it, this horror may appear again and I just cannot accept that,"" Campbell told ABC television.
The report, which recommended referring 19 current and former soldiers for potential prosecution, caused shame and anger in Australia, a country that usually honours its military history with fervour.
""I see layers of responsibility here,"" Campbell said. ""I'm determined to see deep, comprehensive and enduring change where it is needed.""

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Burkina Faso heads to the polls on Sunday in an election dominated by jihadist violence, which has cost over 2,000 lives this year and will prevent voting in hundreds of villages. 
President Roch Kaboré is seeking a second five-year term, campaigning on achievements including free healthcare for children under the age of five, and paving some of the red dirt roads that snake across the arid West African country. 
But a surge in attacks by groups with links to the militant groups al Qaeda and Islamic State has eclipsed everything else. Three weeks after his inauguration, al Qaeda’s regional branch attacked a hotel and a cafe in the capital, killing 32 people; an ambush on mine workers in the east last year killed 39. 
""I like Kaboré , but he hasn't managed the security situation. The north has been forgotten, there is no government authority there,"" said Tiadiane Bonkoungou, who sells blankets and drapes at a market stall in Ouagadougou. 
Kaboré faces stiff opposition from former finance minister Zephirin Diabré, the runner-up in 2015, and Eddie Komboigo, who runs the party of Blaise Campaoré, the president of 27 years who was overthrown in 2014. Analysts expect a tight race that could go to a second round if no candidate wins more than 50%. 
Provisional results of the first round are expected by midweek.
In a press conference on Saturday, Diabré said that the president was orchestrating ""massive fraud"" ahead of the vote, without providing evidence. 
The electoral commission says polling stations will remain shut across much of the north and east for fear of violence.

At least 400,000 people - nearly 7% of the electorate - will be unable to cast their votes, official data show.

U.S.-based SITE, which monitors jihadist websites, said AQIM displayed the dead body of its former leader for the first time in a video. 
The French army killed Droukdel in Mali after hunting him for more than seven years in the Sahel region. 
AQIM said that following Droukdel's death, another Algerian, Sheikh Mujahid Yazid Mubarak, also known as Abu Ubaida Yusuf al-Annabi, was chosen as successor.

The San Isidro Movement, a group of artists, journalists and academics, has had numerous run-ins with Communist authorities in recent years as it tests and protests limits on freedom of speech in the one party state.
Members and allies say they have been detained multiple times for peacefully protesting the arrest last week of rapper Denis Solis and his sentencing to eight months in prison for what authorities said was ""contempt.""
Solis accused a police officer of trespassing in his home, calling the officer a ""coward"" and a ""rat"" in a verbal confrontation he livestreamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and insulted Cuban President Raoul Castro. 
Six activists say they started a hunger strike last week after authorities besieged their headquarters. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claims.
At least two police cars and more than a dozen officials were blocking access to the Movimiento San Isidro office. A man who identified himself as Jorge Gomez and said he worked for public health authorities said access was restricted due to a coronavirus outbreak.
The Cuban government did not reply to a request for comment.
""The ongoing harassment and intimidation of members of the San Isidro movement ... shows Cuba’s ongoing repression of human rights, including the right to freedom of expression,"" Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said in a statement.
She said “contempt” was a crime inconsistent with international human rights law. 
Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch Americas, said on Twitter he was ""very concerned.""
The Cuban government dismisses opposition activists as a tiny minority who receive money from the United States to destabilize the government. 
Activists say expanded internet access, with improved access to independent information sources - in tandem with greater U.S. attempts to force democratic reform - has resulted in authorities cracking down harder on them.

LONDON (Reuters) - England will end a national COVID-19 lockdown on Dec. 2 and move into tougher tiered regional restrictions than before, with more areas facing severe constraints to prevent the virus from reigniting, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said. 
Johnson ordered England in to a month-long lockdown in early November after infection cases and deaths started to rise again, angering businesses and some of his own political party over the economic consequences.
A second wave of infections has started to flatten, official data shows, but scientific advisers are expected to warn on Monday that previous regional restrictions did not go far enough and harder measures are needed to prevent another national lockdown. 
""The Prime Minister and his scientific advisors are clear the virus is still present - and without regional restrictions it could quickly run out of control again before vaccines and mass testing have had an effect,"" a spokeswoman said. 
""That would put in jeopardy the progress the country has made, and once again risk intolerable pressure on the NHS (National Health Service).""
Britain has suffered the worst death toll in Europe and the deepest economic contraction of any G7 nation, prompting sharp criticism of Johnson's handling of the pandemic. 
Prior to the latest lockdown, England had been placed into three tiers, with the toughest measures imposed in northern England, where movement was limited and pubs were forced to close unless they sold substantial meals. 
Johnson's office said the prime minister would set out a new COVID Winter Plan on Monday, with more areas placed into the higher restrictions under the tiered system. 
He will discuss it with his cabinet of leading ministers on Sunday and present to parliament on Monday. The plan will also include details on interactions at Christmas.
Ministers will announce which areas will be placed into which tier on Thursday, with lawmakers able to vote on the system before it comes into force. The tiers will be reviewed. 
The move is likely to be met with fierce resistance from some lawmakers who argue that the country cannot afford to close shops and hospitality again after unemployment numbers and debt jumped, and economic output plunged 20% in the second quarter. 
The government has argued that the virus will overwhelm hospitals and cripple the economy if it is left unchecked. The opposition Labour Party said a package of support would be needed for any business having to close. 

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also under varying levels of restrictions, set by their local governments.

RIYADH/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Saturday he was confident that Democrat Joe Biden's incoming U.S. administration would pursue policies that help regional stability and that any discussions with it would lead to strong cooperation. 
Riyadh is bracing itself for a new U.S. president who pledged on the election campaign trail to reassess ties with Saudi Arabia, a state he described as a ""pariah"" in 2019. 
""I'm confident that a Biden administration would continue to pursue policies that are in the interest of regional stability,"" Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told Reuters in a virtual interview on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders Summit, which his country is hosting. 
""Any discussions we will have with the future administration will lead to strong cooperation.""
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman enjoyed close personal ties with President Donald Trump and their relationship provided a buffer against international criticism over Riyadh's rights record following the murder of Saudi journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi, Riyadh's role in Yemen's war and the detention of women's rights activists.
Those areas may now become points of friction between Biden and Saudi Arabia, a major oil exporter and buyer of U.S. arms.
Prince Faisal emphasized the 75-year history of ""strong defence cooperation"" between the two countries and said he expected it to continue.
He said it would be ""entirely appropriate"" for the United States to designate the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organisation.
""We all know much of their weapons and a significant part of their ideology comes from Iran. So they are certainly a foreign-backed terrorist organization,"" he said.
Washington sees the group as an extension of Iranian influence in the region. Trump's administration has been threatening to blacklist the group, sources have told Reuters, as part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Tehran. Iran denies that it gives financial and military support to the Houthis.
Saudi Arabia lobbied hard for the campaign against rival Iran, and at issue is how Biden will address Tehran's ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies in any talks to revive an international nuclear pact with Iran that Trump quit in 2018.
Prince Faisal also said the kingdom enjoyed ""good, amicable"" relations with Turkey, which has been at odds with the kingdom for some years over foreign policy and attitudes towards Islamist political groups. The murder of Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul sharply heightened tensions.
For more than a year, some Saudi and Turkish traders have speculated that Saudi Arabia was enforcing an informal boycott of imports from Turkey.
The minister said he hasn't seen any numbers that would support the existence of a boycott. 
Commenting on the rift among Gulf countries with Qatar, Prince Faisal said Riyadh was seeking a way to end a dispute with Qatar. The dispute dates from 2017 when the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a boycott on Qatar, severing diplomatic and transport ties and accusing it of supporting terrorism. Qatar denies allegations of supporting terrorism.
In the lead-up to the G20, leading human rights groups and families of jailed activists called on G20 capitals to boycott the summit over Riyadh's rights record.
Asked whether Saudi Arabia was considering clemency for detained women's rights activists, a prospect initially raised by the Saudi ambassador to the UK and subsequently walked back, Prince Faisal said clemency was a ""non-issue"", given the women were still on trial.

The detainees are accused of harming Saudi interests. Few charges have been made public but some relate to contacts with foreign journalists, diplomats and rights groups.

LAGOS (Reuters) - A judicial panel investigating claims that Nigerian soldiers shot dead peaceful protesters in Lagos viewed videos on Saturday appearing to show people hurt or saying that they were being fired on, but an army general dismissed the footage.
Brigadier General Ahmed Taiwo, who heads the army's 81st Division in Lagos, also said soldiers had been deployed to the protest with both live rounds and blanks, having previously told the panel only blanks were used. 
The panel is looking into allegations that the army and police last month opened fire on and killed people protesting at the city's Lekki Toll Gate against police brutality.
The protests were largely peaceful but triggered some of the worst civil unrest since Nigeria's return to civilian rule in 1999. They climaxed in the events of Oct. 20, in which the rights group Amnesty International said soldiers and police had killed at least 12 protesters in two districts.
Both the army and police have denied killing demonstrators.
The panel on Saturday watched surveillance camera footage of events at the toll gate on the evening of Oct. 20 as well as videos submitted by others. 
One video, supplied by the army, appeared to show a person lying in a pool of blood. ""We discovered it was a fake video,"" Taiwo said, adding that the footage had been found online. 
The panel viewed other videos including one where a voice, amid the sound of gunfire, said: ""They are shooting at protesters"". Another showed a crowd, where a woman shouted: ""They are shooting at us!""
Taiwo said: ""Many of these videos there were manipulated.""
In his testimony last week, Taiwo said soldiers had fired blank rounds only, into the air, to disperse protesters. But on Saturday, he said soldiers had been sent with live rounds too.

""The soldiers would be given both live and blank bullets,"" he said. ""We saw that these protests had been infiltrated by some hoodlums. That is why they were armed with blank ammunition in addition to the live they were carrying.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Several thousand people protested in Paris on Saturday against a bill that would make it a crime to circulate an image of a police officer's face with the intention that they should be harmed.
Supporters say police officers and their families need protection from harassment, both online and in person when off duty.
Opponents say the law would infringe journalists' freedom to report, and make it harder to hold police accountable for abuses such as excessive use of force - a growing public concern. The offence would carry a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a 45,000-euro ($53,000) fine.
On the Trocadero Square in western Paris, rights activists, trade unionists and journalists chanted ""Everybody wants to film the police!"" and ""Freedom!"", as police wearing riot gear stood by around the square.
Many demonstrators wore the high-visibility jackets of the ""Yellow Vest"" movement that started a wave of anti-government protests two years ago.
Some held signs that read ""We'll put down our (smart)phones when you put down your weapons"".
Similar demonstrations were planned in Marseille, Lille, Montpellier, Rennes, Saint-Etienne and Nice.
In Paris, police clashed with demonstrators at the end of the protest. By 7:45 p.m., 23 people had been arrested and a police officer slightly injured, the police prefecture tweeted.
Edwy Plenel, chief editor of the investigative news website Mediapart, said the proposed legislation was ""a green light for the worst elements in the police"".
""Those in power are increasingly trying to prevent citizens, journalists and whistleblowers from revealing the failures of the state. When this happens, democracy fades away,"" he added.
Last Tuesday, two journalists were detained in a protest that led to clashes with police as lawmakers in the National Assembly began debating the bill, which is backed by President Emmanuel Macron's party and its parliamentary allies.
The bill passed its first reading on Friday and there will be a second reading on Tuesday. It then goes to the Senate for further debate before it can become law.
An amendment drafted by the government and approved on Friday modified the article in question, 24, to add the phrase ""without prejudice to the right to inform"".

Prime Minister Jean Castex said this would ""remove any ambiguity on the intention to guarantee respect for public freedoms while better protecting those, police and gendarmes, who ensure the protection of the population"".

Travel between municipalities will be banned from 11 p.m. on Nov. 27 to 5 a.m. on Dec. 2, and then again from 11 p.m. on Dec. 4 to 5 a.m. on Dec. 9, to prevent movement around national holidays on Dec. 1 and Dec. 8.
Schools will close on the Mondays before both holidays, while businesses must close early. Employers are being encouraged to give workers the day off in order to minimise travel activity.
""We continue to have a very high number of cases which is a threat to our health,"" Costa told a press conference. ""We must persist to not only halt that growth rate but invert it.""
Masks, already mandatory in public and enclosed commercial spaces, are now also mandatory in the workplace, Costa said. Checks will increase to ensure that those who can are working remotely.
A night-time curfew and weekend lockdown after 1 p.m. in 191 municipalities since Nov. 9 will continue in 174 municipalities with particularly high infection rates for a further two weeks.
Portugal reported 62 deaths and 6,472 cases of coronavirus on Saturday, mostly in the north of the country, bringing the total infections to 255,970 cases, with 3,824 deaths.
The number of cases has increased significantly since late September, with average daily rates rising from around 300 in the summer to 6,000 in recent weeks despite testing only increasing approximately three-fold, health ministry data shows.
The country, with around 10 million people, ranks seventh in Europe for the number of cumulative cases per 100,000 people and 14th for the number of new deaths, according to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control figures.

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Burkina Faso opposition candidate Zephirin Diabre said President Roch Kabore is orchestrating a ""massive fraud"" to secure re-election in Sunday's presidential vote, and that he will not accept results marred by irregularities.
Diabre, a 61-year-old former finance minister, is one of the main challengers in a field of 12 who are seeking to unseat Kabore in Burkina Faso's second democratic elections since a 2014 revolution.
Diabre told a news conference on Saturday that ruling party agents are paying women in markets to hand over voting cards so that someone else can vote for them. He waved aloft a video on his mobile phone purportedly showing this occurring, but did not provide further evidence of wrongdoing. 
Diabre said his party will file a complaint with the state prosecutor and asked the electoral commission to end the practice.
""The massive nature of the phenomenon may undermine the serenity and integrity of the results of the November 22 elections,"" Diabre said.
The president of Kabore's MPP party, Simon Compaore called the allegations ""false"". 
Electoral commission representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The head of a mission by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which arrived to meet opposition members as Diabre's conference was ending, said that he had seen no evidence of fraud. 
""We have been blessed to witness a very calm and gentlemanly campaign. We have no worries of fraud,"" the former prime minister of Guinea, Kabine Komara, told Reuters.
Analysts expect a tight race between Kabore, Diabre and another candidate, Eddie Komboigo, with the possiblity of a second round election if no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote on Sunday. 
At least 400,000 people, or nearly 7% of the Burkina Faso electorate, will not be able to vote due to an Islamist insurgency linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State that has forced a million people to flee. 

By order of the electoral commission, polling stations will not open in hundreds of villages hard-hit by attacks in the north and east.

More than two weeks into Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's offensive, the government says Tigrayan forces are bulldozing roads and destroyed bridges to hold up the advance on regional capital Mekelle, home to about half a million people.
The Tigrayans have promised ""hell"" for their advancing enemies. They have denied destroying bridges but were not reachable for comment about ploughing up roads. 
Hundreds, possibly thousands, have died and more than 30,000 refugees have fled to Sudan since the conflict erupted on Nov. 4. The fighting has spread beyond Tigray, whose forces have fired rockets at the neighbouring Amhara region and the nation of Eritrea, spurring concern of a wider war and the splintering of multi-ethnic Ethiopia. 
Abiy's government has said it will soon reach Mekelle after taking various surrounding towns. On Saturday it said Adigrat had also fallen, about 116 km (72 miles) north of Mekelle.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) rebels said nine civilians had died among heavy casualties in artillery hits on Adigrat.
The government could not immediately be reached for comment, but has previously repeatedly denied targeting civilians.
Assertions on all sides are hard to verify because phone and internet connections have been down since the beginning of the conflict and media are largely barred.
Eritrea denies TPLF allegations it has sent soldiers over the border to back Abiy's offensive against the Tigrayan forces, who are also an old foe of Eritrea's.

AFRICAN ENVOYS
On Friday, the African Union bloc appointed former presidents Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and Kgalema Motlanthe of South Africa as special envoys to seek a ceasefire and mediation talks. 
Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for a peace pact with Eritrea, aims to capture TPLF leaders before talking.
""News circulating that the envoys will be travelling to Ethiopia to mediate between the Federal Government and TPLF’s criminal element is fake,"" the government tweeted on Saturday.
Abiy accuses the Tigrayan leaders of revolting against central authority and attacking federal troops in the town of Dansha. The rebels say Abiy's government has marginalised and persecuted Tigrayans since taking office two years ago.
Abiy denies that, saying he is seeking only to restore law and order and preserve the unity of Ethiopia and its 115 million people. 
Aid workers say the conflict is creating a humanitarian crisis in Tigray, where many among the more than 5 million population were already displaced and relying on food aid even before the conflict. 
Satellite images from U.S.-based space company Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR) showed destroyed buildings lining the main road near Dansha airport, where the government says there was a Nov. 4 surprise attack on federal troops. 
The TPLF is popular in its home region and dominated national politics from 1991 until Abiy took office. Abiy's parents are from the larger Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups.
""We will do all that is necessary to ensure stability prevails in the Tigray region and that our citizens are free from harm and want,"" the prime minister tweeted on Saturday. 
Over the border with Sudan, the United Nations is planning for the possible arrival of 200,000 refugees. 
""The situation is very dire,"" said Jens Hesemann, emergency response coordinator for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, from the Hamdayet crossing point, appealing for urgent donor aid as he stood before tents and crowds of recently-arrived Ethiopians.

Thousands of refugees in Hamdayet and another crossing point, Luqdi, have been lining up for jerry cans and helpings of cornflour porridge, and putting up makeshift tents under scrubland trees. Many had crowded into boats to cross a river into Sudan.

The U.S. Justice Department's parole commission decided on Friday to allow a travel ban on Pollard to expire. The move was seen by some as a parting gift from the Trump administration to its ally Israel.
""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomes the lifting of the restrictions on Jonathan Pollard,"" a statement from the Israeli leader's office said. 
""The Prime Minister thanked Israeli Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer for responsibly and sensitively leading the contacts with the administration. The Prime Minister hopes to see Jonathan Pollard in Israel soon,"" the statement said.
Pollard pleaded guilty in 1986 to conspiracy to commit espionage in connection with providing Israeli contacts with hundreds of classified documents he had obtained as a naval intelligence specialist in exchange for thousands of dollars.
He was sentenced in 1987 to life in prison. After serving 30 years, which included time in custody following his 1985 arrest, he was released on parole in 2015 under terms which dictated he remain in the U.S. for five years. 
Pollard, 66, has sought to move to Israel, which granted him citizenship while in prison and had long pushed for his release. The espionage affair strained U.S.-Israel relations for decades. 
Netanyahu's statement was echoed by other Israeli ministers and by President Ruvi Rivlin.

""Over the years we have shared in Jonathan Pollard's pain, and felt a responsibility and commitment to bring about his release. Now we will be able to welcome him and his family home,"" Rivlin said on Twitter.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - When Category 5 Hurricane Iota roared over the small Colombian island of Providencia in the early hours of Monday morning, Yeisler Chamorro and his wife hunkered down underneath a mattress in their bedroom.
Nearly all the infrastructure on the island of some 6,000 people, near the coast of Central America, was damaged or destroyed by the storm, which sent rubble raining down on top of Chamorro, 29.
""I was saved by my mattress,"" Chamorro said, as he showed a Reuters reporter the temporary repairs he has made to the room's roof. ""Stuff was falling on us, debris and everything, but thank God we survived. Material things you can get back, the important thing is life.""
Iota's winds and heavy rains have killed around 40 people across Central America and Colombia, including at least two in Providencia.
In Nicaragua, it inundated low-lying areas still reeling from the impact two weeks ago of Eta, another major hurricane that killed dozens of people in the region.
""When I got up and looked out, the first impression I had was that the neighbors were dead,"" air conditioning technician Chamorro said.
""I had to go out to see how my relatives were...when I arrived I found out everyone was alive.""
Many residents are still in shock over the destruction, Chamorro said, but the born-and-bred islander is committed to rebuilding.
""We'll fight and get ahead because this is a new beginning,"" he said. ""More than asking God why, we have to be grateful we're alive.""
Colombia's government has credited an alerts system and shelters for the low death toll on the island, whose residents speak a Creole language as well as Spanish.

Larger island San Andres, part of the same archipelago and which also sustained damage in the storm, has become a destination for hundreds of evacuees from Providencia seeking to reunite with family members.

One was probably a man of high status, aged between 30 and 40, who still bore traces of a woollen cloak under his neck.
The second, probably aged 18 to 23, was dressed in a tunic and had a number of crushed vertebrae, indicating that he had been a slave who did heavy labour.
The remains were found in Civita Giuliana, 700 metres northwest of the centre of ancient Pompeii, in an underground chamber in the area of a large villa being excavated.
The men's teeth and bones were preserved, and the voids left by their soft tissues were filled with plaster that was left to harden and then excavated to show the outline of their bodies. 
""These two victims were perhaps seeking refuge when they were swept away by the pyroclastic current at about 9 in the morning,"" said Massimo Osanna, director of the archeological site. ""It is a death by thermal shock, as also demonstrated by their clenched feet and hands."" 
In a statement, Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said the find underlined Pompeii's status as ""an incredible place for research and study"". 
Pompeii, 23 km (14 miles) southeast of Naples, was home to about 13,000 people when the eruption buried it under under ash, pumice pebbles and dust, freezing it in time.

The remains were not discovered until the 16th century and organised excavations began around 1750. However, more recently, attention has focused on arresting the decay or collapse of the exposed ruins.

ZERMATT, Switzerland (Reuters) - Blue skies over the Matterhorn drew skiers and snowboarders to Zermatt on Saturday, as well as police to break up crowds, as Switzerland's modest coronavirus restrictions allowed near-normal operations while other Alpine resorts keep their lifts shut.
France, Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered even the high-altitude lifts that could be running this early in the winter to remain closed for now in the hope that all resorts can benefit at peak-season, if and when the infection rate slows.
Switzerland, despite being a second-wave coronavirus hotspot with 5,000 infections a day and mounting deaths, is hoping that a middle way of social distancing, limits on gatherings and mask-wearing on lifts can prop up pillars of the economy such as tourism without fuelling the pandemic. 
""If it's open, I'll definitely ski,"" said Swede Max Ahlstedt, on the glacier where Zermatt offers year-round skiing. ""You just have to ... accept wearing a mask.""
Over the border in Cervinia, on the Italian side of the glacier, the lifts have been closed indefinitely since Oct. 25.
Some Swiss resorts, including Davos to the northwest, boast of ""cold-fogging"" equipment to blast the interiors of gondolas and ""kill 99.9% of viruses, bacteria and spores in a minute"".
The Swiss tourism association has even adopted ""Clean & Safe"" as its motto in the hope of easing tourists' nerves.
And there is no denying the sense of release from confinement that a day on the slopes can bring.
""It'd be worse if you couldn't go to the mountains at all,"" said Anne Spiegler, a German living in Zurich.
Swiss skier Jean-Francois Paschoud said that it ""makes you forget the mask measures"".
Swiss resorts know that the number of guests from Britain, the Netherlands, Germany or Scandinavia will inevitably be far below the levels of a normal season as the wait for a vaccine stunts cross-border travel.
Other countries will be glad to start their winter tourist season at all.
In Austria, the Kitzsteinhorn glacier near Zell am See and the Hintertux glacier near Mayrhofen both hope to reopen on Dec. 6, the moment that a national lockdown ends - and to banish memories of an outbreak among visitors last February in the Tyrolean resort of Ischgl that spread coronavirus across Europe.

Britain brought sanctions against 25 Russians and 20 Saudis in July as part of post-Brexit measures foreign minister Dominic Raab said were aimed at stopping the laundering of ""blood money"".
The British list includes Russian nationals Britain has said were involved in the mistreatment and death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.
Magnitsky was arrested in 2008 after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud. Magnitsky died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after complaining of mistreatment.
""For all the subjects related to the death of S. Magnitsky, we have repeatedly given exhaustive comments and explanations which, apparently, London prefers to ignore,"" Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, said in a statement.

The actions of the British side look like an attempt to interfere in another country's internal affairs and put pressure on the Russian justice system, she added.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - With a parade of people dressed in dinosaur costumes to represent Thailand's establishment, high school students led a protest by thousands of people in Bangkok on Saturday with calls to bring down the government and reform the monarchy.
It was the first major protest since Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Thursday that police would use all laws against protesters, who have become the biggest challenge to Thailand's rulers in years.
""We represent the meteorites crushing the dinosaurs to extinction,"" 15-year-old high school student leader Benjamaporn Nivas told Reuters.
Benjamaporn and another leader of the Bad Student group were summoned on Friday for charges over a previous protest, but police said Saturday's demonstration could go ahead.
Protests since July have been around three core demands: the removal of former junta leader Prayuth as prime minister, a new constitution and reforms to the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
But the high school students also seek greater freedom and fairer treatment within an education system they say is archaic and aimed primarily at inculcating obedience. Many spoke of the importance of gender equality.
""I have been sexually abused by teachers. School is not a safe place,"" said a placard held by one student who sat in uniform with her mouth taped shut in protest. 
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said the prime minister hoped protesters would exercise their freedom constructively and within the law.
One of the hashtags used by the Bad Student group on Saturday translates as #ByeByeDinosaurs.
Dinosaur-costumed performers paraded to the theme tune of the Royal News, which is shown on Thai television every night.
But Benjamaporn said the students were being careful about references to the monarchy after activists took Prayuth's comments on using all laws against protesters to mean the possible resumption of prosecutions under laws prohibiting insults of the monarchy.
Protesters have broken longstanding taboos with open criticism of the monarchy.
Prayuth has rejected the demand of protesters that he resign and their accusations that he engineered last year's election to keep power that he first seized from an elected government in 2014. 

The Royal Palace has made no comment since the protests began in July. When asked about the protesters earlier this month, the king said ""we love them all the same"" and described Thailand as a ""land of compromise"".

The report, published on Thursday after an inquiry into the conduct of special forces personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, found that senior commandos forced junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to ""blood"" the troops for combat.
It recommended referring 19 current and former soldiers for potential prosecution.
""This is a terrible, terribly disturbing and distressing report,"" Morrison said on Saturday in his first public comments since the publication of the document. 
""But the thing about Australia is - is we will deal with it. And we will deal with it under our law, under our systems, and our justice system.""

Australia, which usually honours its military history with fervour, reacted with shame and anger to the severity of the report's findings.

The ISF statement did not say how the 69 prisoners had escaped from the facility, which a security source said holds pre-trial detainees and is part of Baabda district prison near Beirut.
President Michel Aoun was briefed by the caretaker interior minister about the break-out and ordered that search operations be intensified and the incident be investigated, the Presidency tweeted.
The ISF said 15 prisoners had been caught while four others turned themselves in. The five died when a car they seized crashed into a tree in what the statement described as an accident while one prisoner was injured and taken to hospital.
The state news agency NNA earlier said the prisoners had escaped from the prison at dawn after breaking open cell doors. 
In April, Amnesty International said there had been riots inside Lebanese jails and families had organised sit-in protests calling for the release of prisoners over concerns about the spread of COVID-19 in overcrowded prisons.

It said that while the Lebanese government had taken several measures, including some releases, the authorities should prioritise releasing prisoners who had served their sentences and expedite a review of pre-trial detainees.

Johnson on Friday backed his Home Secretary Priti Patel, despite an inquiry finding she had broken the ministerial code by shouting and swearing at staff. The author of the report, the government's ethics adviser Alex Allan, resigned. 
On Saturday, the Times newspaper and the BBC said Johnson had tried and failed to convince Allan to tone down his findings, particularly the assertion that Patel's behaviour amounted to bullying. 
""He read all of it and didn't think Alex's findings accorded with the evidence itself,"" The Times quoted a source in the government's cabinet office as saying. ""He spoke to Alex and asked him if he'd change the tone of it. Alex said no.""
A spokeswoman for Johnson's office said the report reflected Allan's thinking. ""As you would expect, the prime minister spoke to Sir Alex Allan to further his understanding of the issues. Sir Alex's conclusions are entirely his own.""
Patel has apologised for her behaviour and Johnson, who decided the ministerial code had not been breached, said he had full faith in his interior minister.

The issue comes at a difficult time for Johnson, who is trying to reset his government after his top adviser Dominic Cummings left Downing Street last week. His leadership and judgment has also been questioned over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

A former Supreme Court justice is leading a new inquiry into how the broadcaster obtained the interview and whether executives covered up any wrongdoing after accusations that the late princess was tricked into taking part. 
Prince William, the second in line to the throne, said earlier this week that the investigation was a step in the right direction and a source close to Harry said on Saturday that the prince was getting regular updates. 
The person familiar with the situation also questioned some British media reports which asked why Harry, living in California with his wife Meghan and son Archie, had not joined his brother in welcoming the investigation earlier.
""Sadly, some people are not just seeing this as a drive for truth, but also trying to use this as an opportunity to try to drive a wedge between the brothers,"" the person said.
Diana's Panorama interview with Martin Bashir was watched by more than 20 million viewers in Britain and became one of the defining moments of her failed marriage to Prince Charles. 
It included an admission of an affair and the line that there ""were three of us in this marriage"", referring to Charles' relationship with his now second wife, Camilla Parker-Bowles. 
This month, Diana's brother Charles Spencer said the BBC had failed to apologise for what he said were forged documents and ""other deceit"" which led him to introduce Diana to Bashir.
The BBC has said the broadcaster is determined to get to the truth about Spencer's assertions and has appointed John Dyson, one of the country's most senior retired judges, to lead the inquiry. 
Bashir has made no public comment on the situation and the corporation says the journalist, who gained global renown from the interview, is currently on sick leave, recovering from heart surgery and from contracting COVID-19. 
Harry and Meghan moved to California after stepping back from royal duties in January and have signed a multi-year production deal with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as part of their plans to be more financially independent.
The source added that the couple had decided to share their property in England, Frogmore Cottage, with his cousin Eugenie but would stay there when they visit the UK.

Tony Blair and David Cameron released a statement to the Telegraph newspaper urging Johnson to maintain Britain's pledge to spend 0.7% of GDP on aid and development following reports it could be cut to conserve cash during the pandemic. 
British finance minister Rishi Sunak will deliver a spending review on Wednesday, setting out government spending over the next year after COVID-19 blew a 200 billion pound ($266 billion) hole in the country's finances. 
""Abandoning the 0.7 target for aid would be a moral, strategic and political mistake,"" Cameron, prime minister from 2010 to 2016 and a member of Johnson's Conservative Party, said.
The two former leaders argued that any move to cut spending on aid would undermine Britain's position when it hosts the G7 summit in 2021. The decision comes as the country embarks on a new future outside the European Union. 
Blair, a Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007 who introduced the 0.7% target, said the spending had tackled disease, boosted education and helped to increase living standards across large swathes of Africa.
""This has been a great British soft power achievement,"" he said. ""It isn't about charity. It's enlightened self-interest.
""Neither the challenge of climate or coronavirus can be met without Africa. Nor can those of extremism and uncontrolled immigration. To change it is a profound strategic mistake, and I sincerely hope the government will not do it.""
Johnson was asked on Wednesday during his weekly question session in parliament to rule out a cut to the aid budget, and declined to do so.

The explosions, some close to the diplomatic enclave, sent warning sirens blaring from embassies and it comes two days before a major donor conference for Afghanistan in Geneva.
Tariq Arian, spokesman for the Ministry of Interior, said at least eight civilians had been killed in the attack and 31 wounded. A health ministry official said five bodies and 21 injured were taken to the hospital from the incident. 
Arian said ""terrorists"" mounted 14 rockets in a small truck and set them off, adding that an investigation is going on to find out how the vehicle came inside the city. 
Some residents filmed the rockets being fired and posted them on social media. Several pictures circulating on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) showed damaged cars, shattered windows and holes in residential homes. 
A picture of a young brother and sister, whom officials said were killed in their home, was widely shared on Facebook.
One of the rockets landed in the vicinity of the Iranian embassy and several fragments hit the main building but there were no casualties among the staff, the embassy said in a statement. 
Since peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban stalled in the Qatari capital of Doha, attacks by the Taliban and other extremist groups have been on the rise, especially in the capital that is home to more than five million Afghans.
Taliban insurgents, fighting against a foreign-backed Kabul administration, denied involvement in the attack. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travels to Qatar on Saturday to meet with an Afghan delegation and Taliban negotiators.
Early this month, several gunmen stormed Kabul University campus and killed at least 35, most of them students and wounded more than 50.

The attack was claimed by the Islamic State militant group.

Lobsang Sangay, President of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), was invited to the White House to meet the newly appointed U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, Robert Destro, on Friday, the CTA said in a press release.
""This unprecedented meeting perhaps will set an optimistic tone for CTA participation with U.S. officials and be more formalised in the coming years,"" said the CTA, which is based in India's Dharamshalah.
Tibet has become one of the areas of dispute between the United States and China, with relations between the world's two biggest economies at their lowest point in decades. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Beijing in July of violating Tibetan human rights and said Washington supported ""meaningful autonomy"" for the region.
Beijing officials have since accused the United States of using Tibet to try to promote ""splittism"" in China. China has also refused to engage with Destro.
China seized control over Tibet in 1950 in what it described as a ""peaceful liberation"" that helped it throw off its ""feudalist past"", but critics led by the exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama say Beijing's rule amounts to ""cultural genocide"".
Chinese President Xi Jinping said in August that China needed to build an ""impregnable fortress"" in Tibet in order to protect national unity.

NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - India on Saturday summoned a senior Pakistani diplomat over what New Delhi said was a foiled attack this week in the frontier territory of Jammu and Kashmir by a Pakistan-based militant group, a charge the neighbouring country denied.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that the killing of four Jaish-e-Mohammed militants in a gun battle with security forces, and the recovery of a large cache of weapons and explosives from them, indicated that they were planning to ""wreak major havoc and destruction"" in the region ahead of local elections there.
India's Ministry of External Affairs said a protest was lodged with Pakistan's charge d'affaires in New Delhi.
""India reiterated its longstanding demand that Pakistan fulfil its international obligations and bilateral commitments to not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Modi's allegations as groundless.
""We view these as part of India’s desperate attempts to divert international attention from its state-terrorism in (Indian-ruled Kashmir) and state-sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan,"" the ministry said late on Friday following Modi's comments on Twitter.
Tension between the nuclear-armed rivals has sharpened since last August, when Modi's government ended the autonomy of its only Muslim-majority region. Kashmir is also claimed by Pakistan.
Earlier this month, Pakistan said it had compiled a dossier with evidence that militancy inside its borders was being sponsored by India to target Chinese investments, and that these operations were being run out of neighbouring Afghanistan.
India termed the accusations as ""figments of imagination"".
India will hold district-level elections this month in Jammu and Kashmir, the first such exercise there since the federal government took away the area's statehood more than a year ago.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea grappled with a resurgence in COVID-19 cases on Saturday, as a senior official warned it could be the country's largest wave of infections if the spread is not quickly contained. 
The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 386 new daily coronavirus cases as of midnight on Friday, bringing total infections to 30,403, with 503 deaths. New cases topped 300 for the fourth day in a row, after Tuesday saw the highest since August.
""We are at a critical juncture; if we fail to block the current spread, we could be facing a large nationwide infection that surpasses"" the first two waves, senior KDCA official Lim Sook-young told a news briefing. The country was hit by a jump in cases in late February-early March and August.
The standard for imposing tougher social distancing measures was expected to be reached soon, Lim said. The daily national tally was expected to reach 400 new cases next week and more than 600 in early December if the current rate of one patient infecting 1.5 people was not curbed, she added.
Due to recent infections spreading among college and private after-school tuition academies, she especially urged young people to refrain from meeting and to get tested early. 
South Korea tightened prevention guidelines on Thursday ahead of highly competitive annual college entrance exams on Dec. 3, and Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun called on Friday for all social gatherings to be cancelled, but bars, nightclubs, religious services and sports events continue to be permitted with attendance restrictions.
South Korea is negotiating to secure COVID-19 vaccines for 30 million people, or about 60% of the population, of which vaccines for 10 million people are expected to be procured through the global COVID-19 vaccine facility known as COVAX, Lim said. 
The Seoul metropolitan region recorded 262 new cases on Friday, up from 218 cases on Thursday. 
Health officials have previously said the capital region, where about half of the country's 52 million people live and work, could be subject to tougher restrictions if the average daily infection over a week rose to 200 or more.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Relatives and supporters of 12 Hongkongers, detained in China after trying to flee the city by speedboat, protested on Saturday on an island near the Chinese prison where they have been held virtually incommunicado for nearly three months.
The 11 men and one woman were captured by the Chinese coastguard on Aug. 23 aboard a speedboat believed to be bound for Taiwan.
All had faced charges linked to the protest movement embroiling Hong Kong, including rioting and violation of the a national security law China imposed in June.
Family members and supporters of some of the 12 hiked to the peak of Kat O island in Hong Kong's remote northeastern reaches, looking onto China's high-tech boomtown of Shenzhen, and the Yantian district where the dozen are being held.
Some peered through binoculars at a hill where the detention centre is located. Several told Reuters they want the Chinese authorities to deal with the cases in a just, fair and transparent manner.
The group inflated blue and white balloons and wrote the names of the detainees on them, before releasing them into a leaden sky. They chanted for their ""immediate safe return"" while holding white banners reading ""SAVE 12"" and ""Return Home"".
""I hope he can see the balloons and know we didn’t give up yet,"" said the 28-year-old wife of detainee Wong Wai-yin.
A Hong Kong marine police vessel later docked on the island, with police questioning and taking down the details of several reporters present. 
Authorities have denied family and lawyers access to the 12, insisting they be represented by officially appointed lawyers. Last week seven detainees wrote handwritten letters to their family, but the group said in a statement that ""they seem to have been compiled under duress"". 
Eddie Chu, a former lawmaker who recently quit his post in protest against political suppression by authorities under the national security law, said it was important to keep fighting.

""We are so close to them, just a few kilometres in reality, but in fact it's like ... something unreachable. So we need to have the balloons to do this for us.”

MEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico has committed to the arrest of a high-level cartel leader under a deal with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to drop U.S. drug trafficking charges against a former Mexican defense minister, a senior Mexican source told Reuters. 
The United States dropped the case against retired General Salvador Cienfuegos this week citing ""sensitive and important"" foreign policy considerations that outweighed interest in pursuing the charges. 
In return, Mexico privately told Barr it would work with the United States to arrest a high-level cartel leader involved with trafficking large quantities of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, the source said.
Reuters was unable to establish which cartel leader Mexico and U.S. officials would be targeting and the source declined to give any names citing a fear of endangering the investigation.  
It has not been previously reported that Barr extracted a promise to hone in on a senior cartel leader in return for releasing Cienfuegos. 
""Mexico committed to collaborate with the United States in the capture of a primary objective,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely. 
Daniel Millan, spokesman for Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, said ""what we agreed was to maintain a united front against crime and cooperation that respects the sovereignty of each country."" 
He said he did not have information regarding an agreement about a high-level capture.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice said there was no deal and referred Reuters to earlier statements that said the case was dismissed in a sign of confidence in Mexican justice and because of diplomatic considerations.
The United States flew Cienfuegos back to Mexico on Wednesday, after a U.S. federal judge dropped charges against him at Barr's request. Under the agreement, he will now be investigated in Mexico. 
The decision to release the most senior Mexican defense official ever charged in the United States with cartel collusion met with anger from former agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) who said the United States had a strong case against Cienfuegos. 
Cienfuegos' arrest at Los Angeles International Airport in October was the result of a multi-year investigation that used wire taps to track a military figure, dubbed ""El Padrino"" by traffickers.
Investigators concluded ""El Padrino"" or The Godfather, was Cienfuegos and that he helped the cartel move tonnes of narcotics.
Mexico's government, angry it was not forewarned about the investigation, hailed Cienfuegos' return as a diplomatic achievement and a win for the nation's sovereignty. 
Ebrard and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador have denied speculation that the decision to return him was linked to Lopez Obrador's refusal so far to recognize President-elect Joe Biden as winner of the U.S. presidential election - a move Lopez Obrador has said was ""politically prudent.""
Lopez Obrador's office did not respond to a request for comment. The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about a deal to capture a cartel figure. Reuters was unable to establish the details of the deal. 
CALLS WITH BARR
After the U.S. conviction last year of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the best known leader of the Sinaloa cartel, the focus of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement has turned to the rival Jalisco New Generation Cartel, as well as the remaining 
Sinaloa gang.
The DEA says those two groups are ""likely the primary trafficking groups responsible for smuggling fentanyl into the United States.""
The leader of the Jalisco cartel is Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as El Mencho. The best known leader of the Sinaloa cartel is Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada. Both men are on the DEA's most wanted list, along with others. 
The Mexican foreign ministry spokesman said he was unaware of conversations related to specific cartel leaders.
Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid often mixed in the black market with heroin or fake pharmaceutical pain killers. It is the leading cause of overdose deaths in the United States.
The Mexican government has not clarified how the plan to bring Cienfuegos back to Mexico came about, or when it requested his return.
The source, along with another senior government official, said Barr first proposed the idea of withdrawing charges against Cienfuegos on a call with Ebrard in early November. 
The source said the idea came from Barr, and was not initially a request from Mexico. 
Ebrard spokesman Millan said Mexico requested that the charges be dropped, but could not confirm when, or whether the request happened before a Nov. 6 call with Barr.     
Ebrard this week confirmed two calls with Barr, one in October and one on Nov. 6.
""The proposals...were from Attorney General Barr,"" during a November call, the source said, referring both to the idea to drop charges and the commitment to catch a senior capo.
Asked about whether Barr had proposed to Mexico dropping the charges, rather than the other way round, the Department of Justice spokeswoman said she could not comment on contacts with foreign governments regarding investigative matters. 

While the administration of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump promised to weaken Mexico's cartels, there had been no high profile arrests in the past four years before Cienfuegos' capture as he traveled to the United States for a vacation.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has approved ending a ban on deploying the nation's healthcare workers, his labour minister said on Saturday, clearing the way for thousands of nurses to take up jobs overseas.
""The president already approved the lifting of the temporary suspension of deployment of nurses and other medical workers,"" Labour Secretary Silvestre Bello told Reuters.
Bello said the spread of the novel coronavirus was slowing down in the country and conditions were improving, so the government could afford to let its healthcare workers leave.
The Philippines has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Southeast Asia, but daily case numbers and death rates have dropped.
To ensure the Philippines has enough medical professionals to continue to fight the pandemic at home, only 5,000 healthcare workers will be allowed to leave every year, Bello said.
""We are starting only with a cap of 5,000 so we will not run out (of medical workers), but this may increase eventually,"" Bello said.
Last year, almost 17,000 nurses signed overseas work contracts data from the Commission on Higher Education and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration shows.
The government in April barred nurses, doctors and other medical workers from leaving, saying they were needed to fight the coronavirus crisis at home. 
Thousands of health workers, who call themselves ""priso-nurses"", had appealed to the government to let them take jobs abroad, Reuters reported in September. The nurses say they feel underpaid, under-appreciated and unprotected in the Philippines.
While the lifting of the travel ban was a ""welcome development,"" Maristela Abenojar, President of Filipino Nurses United, challenged the government to make true its commitment to give its nurses better pay and benefits if it wants them to stay.
Filipino health workers are on the front lines of the pandemic at hospitals in the United States, Europe and the Middle East as well as at home.
New coronavirus cases in the Philippines have remained below 2,000 since Nov. 10, while deaths, which totalled 8,025 as of Nov. 20 only equal 1.93% of the country's 415,067 cases. 

Hospital bed occupancy has also eased from critical levels, and the government has been gradually easing quarantine restrictions to jumpstart the coronavirus-hit economy.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday that Canada's hospital system could be overwhelmed by a possible quadrupling of new COVID-19 cases by year end as its biggest city Toronto prepared to impose a lockdown.
Trudeau implored Canadians to stay home as much as possible as a second wave of the novel coronavirus rips across the country, forcing several of the 10 provinces to reimpose curbs on movement and businesses. Cases continue to spike and authorities complain some people are being more careless about taking precautions.
""A normal Christmas is quite frankly right out of the question,"" Trudeau said. Earlier, Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said in the worst case scenario, a spike to 60,000 daily cases, would occur if people became more sociable. Even if current restrictions on gatherings are maintained, new daily cases will jump to over 20,000 by Dec. 31 compared with less than 5,000 now.
""Cases across the country are spiking massively ... we're really at risk of seeing case loads go up and hospitals get overwhelmed,"" said a clearly upset Trudeau.
He dismissed the idea of Ottawa invoking emergency powers to reintroduce the kind of widespread national shutdown that provinces imposed earlier in the year, saying ""I'm not looking to bring in a federal hammer to try and do things.""
However, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced on Friday that Toronto - Canada's most populous city and the heart of the financial system - as well as the nearby region of Peel would enter into lockdown on Monday.
The lockdown measures ban all indoor social gatherings. Restaurants are allowed to offer exclusively takeout and delivery, and most retail stores are permitted curbside pickup only for a minimum of 28 days, according to a government release.
""The situation is extremely serious and further action is required to avoid the worst case scenario,"" Ford said at a press briefing.
Officials predict that by Nov. 30 the total death toll could be between 11,870 and 12,120, with the total cases between 366,500 and 378,600. Canada has recorded a total of 315,751 cases and 11,265 deaths so far.
Separately on Friday, a federal official said Canada expects to receive six million doses of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s COVID-19 vaccines by March 31, 2021, though when the shots can be used will depend on regulatory approval. 
Iain Stewart, president of the Public Health Agency of Canada, told a parliamentary committee that because the vaccines were new, manufacturers need to scale up to meet the overall demand.

""All countries are interested in the very first vaccines, and the companies are trying to distribute out to multiple countries at the same time, so the amounts start out small and then they build over the course of the coming year,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russia on Friday stopped a U.N. Security Council committee from blacklisting a Libyan militia group and its leader for human rights abuses because it said it wanted to see more evidence first that they had killed civilians. 
The United States and Germany proposed that the council's 15-member Libya sanctions committee impose an asset freeze and travel ban on the al-Kaniyat militia and its leader Mohammed al-Kani. Such a move has to be agreed by consensus, but Russia said it could not approve.
""Our support in the future is possible, but conditioned by provision of an irrefutable evidence of their involvement in killing of civilian populations,"" a Russian diplomat told his Security Council colleagues in a note seen by Reuters. 
The Libyan city of Tarhouna, which was recaptured in June by the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), had for years been controlled by the Kaniyat militia run by the local Kani family, which fought alongside Khalifa Haftar’s eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA).
Last month Libyan authorities dug 12 bodies from four more unmarked graves in Tarhouna, adding to the scores of corpses already discovered since June. 
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Last month the two major sides in the country's war - the GNA and the LNA - agreed a ceasefire. 
Turkey backs the GNA. Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt support the LNA. Those foreign powers have been cited in earlier U.N. documents as supplying weapons in defiance of the arms embargo.
The United States and Germany wrote in their sanctions proposal that international human rights groups and the U.N political mission in Libya, known as UNSMIL, has ""received reports of hundreds of human rights abuses perpetrated by the al-Kaniyat militia against private individuals, state officials, captured fighters, and civil society activists in Tarhouna.""
""Under Mohammed al-Kani's leadership, the al-Kaniyat militia has reportedly carried out enforced disappearances, torture, and killings. In addition, UNSMIL verified numerous summary executions at Tarhouna Prison conducted by the al-Kaniyat militia on September 13, 2019,"" the proposal read.

PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (Reuters) - More than 1,000 demonstrators attacked a  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) Brasil supermarket in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre on Friday after security guards beat to death a Black man at the store.
The killing, which has sparked protests across Brazil, occurred late on Thursday when a store employee called security after the man threatened to attack her, cable news channel GloboNews said, citing the Rio Grande do Sul state military police.
Amateur footage of the fatal beating and tributes to the Black victim were published on social media. He was identified in local media by his father as 40-year-old Joao Alberto Silveira Freitas.
News website G1 later reported that an initial analysis by the state forensics institute indicated the cause of death could be asphyxiation. 
In a statement on Friday, the local unit of France's Carrefour SA (OTC:CRRFY) said it deeply regretted what it called a brutal death and said it immediately took steps to ensure those responsible were legally punished.
It said it would terminate the contract with the security firm, fire the employee in charge of the store at the time of the incident, and close the store as a mark of respect.
In Porto Alegre, protesters on Friday afternoon handed out stickers depicting the Carrefour logo stained with blood and called for a boycott of the chain. They held up a banner in Portuguese reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and signs calling for justice for Beto, a nickname for the victim.
The protest turned violent on Friday evening as the demonstrators smashed windows and delivery vehicles in the supermarket's parking area. A Reuters witness saw police firing teargas at the protesters.
In Sao Paulo, dozens of protesters smashed the front windows of a Carrefour store with rocks, pulled off the front doors and stormed the building, spilling products into the aisles before dispersing. In Rio de Janeiro, roughly 200 shouting protesters gathered outside of another Carrefour store location.
Nov. 20 is honored in many parts of Brazil as Black Awareness Day. Brazilians like to think of their country as a harmonious 'racial democracy' and far-right President Jair Bolsonaro denies the presence of racism. But the influence of slavery, abolished in 1899, is still evident. 
Black Brazilians are almost three times as likely to be victims of homicide, according to 2019 government data.

""The culture of hate and racism needs to be combated at its source and the full weight of the law should be used to punish those that promote hate and racism,"" Rodrigo Maia, the speaker of Brazil's lower house of Congress, wrote in a tweet.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Joe Biden's election as U.S. President could help unfreeze peace talks between Colombia's biggest active rebel group, the Marxist National Liberation Army (ELN), and the Colombian government, ELN leader Pablo Beltran told Reuters on Friday.
Right-wing President Ivan Duque suspended fledgling negotiations in Havana to end a five-decade conflict in January 2019 after the ELN carried out a car bomb attack at a police academy in Bogota.
Since then, his government has demanded the group declare a unilateral cease-fire, including a suspension of kidnappings and attacks against the oil and gas industry, and that its fighters group together under international observation as a precondition to holding peace talks. 
The ELN has rejected the demand.
Beltran, head of the ELN peace talks delegation in Havana, said he nonetheless hoped Biden's backing would provide the necessary impetus to find alternatives to get the ball rolling again.
""I see the possibility of picking up conversations again before the end of 2021,"" Beltran said.
The United States has been Colombia's most important ally for decades and backed former President Juan Manuel Santos' 2016 peace deal with the larger rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
Duque's Democratic Center party strongly opposed the deal because it granted impunity to former FARC guerrillas, however.
The ELN, founded in 1964 by radical Roman Catholic priests, has about 2,000 fighters. It is considered more radical and less centrally controlled than the FARC, which is now a legal political party.
Beltran said he felt like the tide was turning against those who most vocally opposed peace deals with Colombia's rebels, like former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, a mentor to Duque who also found favor with outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump. 
""His fierce position against peace is in decline, and his strong support was Trump but Trump is gone,"" Beltran said. 

Uribe and several allies are being investigated over allegations of witness tampering carried out in an attempt to discredit accusations he had ties to Colombia's right-wing paramilitary groups.

The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) said on Thursday that its executive director, Gasser Abdel Razek, was arrested at his home and taken to an unknown location days after two other senior EIPR members were detained on charges including joining a terrorist group.
The arrests came after senior foreign diplomats visited EIPR for a briefing on the human rights situation in Egypt on Nov. 3, the day of the election in which Biden defeated President Donald Trump.
Antony Blinken, who is widely expected to get a top job such as national security adviser or secretary of state under Biden, issued a tweet expressing concern about the treatment of EIPR's senior officials.
""Share concern re. #Egypt's arrests of three employees of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Meeting with foreign diplomats is not a crime. Nor is peacefully advocating for human rights,"" Blinken said as he retweeted a comment by the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.
""We are deeply concerned about the detention of two employees of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, which works to strengthen & protect rights & freedoms in Egypt,"" the agency tweeted on Thursday. ""All people should be free to express their beliefs and advocate peacefully.""
The Egyptian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has been criticized by advocacy groups such as Amnesty International for eroding respect for human rights at home and abroad. Biden has pledged to hold a ""Summit for Democracy"" in his first year seeking to fight corruption and authoritarianism and to advance human rights.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 05:41PM ET</span>",Swiss doctors urge COVID vulnerable to declare end-of-life wishes in advance,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss doctors have urged those vulnerable to COVID-19 complications to record their wishes for end-of-life care in advance to help ease pressure on intensive care units, drawing criticism from an advocacy group.
Pro Senectute Schweiz, an organisation for the elderly, said the doctors' appeal was premature and excessive but medics insist such patient decrees are necessary in the heart-wrenching reality of caring for critical patients during this pandemic.
As health systems grapple with soaring infection rates, medical professionals working with limited resources and finite space in ICUs can at times face agonising dilemmas, and ethical questions around treating COVID-19 patients have spawned a government review in Britain and a court fight in Germany.
Warning that Switzerland was running low on intensive care beds, the Swiss Society for Intensive Care Medicine (SGI) called this week on the ""especially imperiled"", including people over 60, or with health conditions like heart disease and diabetes, to put their wishes on paper in case the worst should happen.
""This will support your own relatives, but also the teams in the ICUs, as they make decisions so the treatment can be done in the best possible manner according to the individual patient wishes,"" SGI said in a statement. 
Pro Senectute Schweiz said the call by the SGI, while in normal times sensible advice, created an impression of urgency inappropriate for a decision that demands deep consideration.
""The SGI appeal...takes place in the context of an absolute emergency situation in which Switzerland does not yet find itself in,"" the group said.
SGI president Thierry Fumeaux, an ICU doctor in the western Swiss city of Nyon, said the group was not aiming to put anyone under pressure or to free up beds, only to encourage them to think ahead.
""This is not a call for sacrifice. It's just a call to take responsibility for their autonomy,"" Fumeaux said. 
Antonio Cuzzoli, who was head of intensive care at northern Italy's Cremona Hospital until July, said that as the coronavirus virus made the Lombardy region ground zero for infections in March and April, some patients committed ""acts of heroism"" by refusing treatment. 
Italy has a ""declaration of renouncement of invasive treatment"", but some in the pre-dominantly Roman Catholic country may refuse it on the basis that it conflicts with their faith, Cuzzoli said. 
In Switzerland, with its long history of legal assisted suicide, there may be less hesitation among people when it comes to making such personal decisions.
In October, Britain's Department of Health and Social Care asked the Care Quality Commission, which monitors and inspects hospitals and nursing homes, to review how so-called ""Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation"" (DNACPR) decisions were conducted during the pandemic.
The review was launched in response to concerns that the elderly and vulnerable were being subjected to DNACPR decisions without their consent or given too little information to make an informed decision.
Emma Cave, a Durham University healthcare law professor who has written extensively about medical ethics, said the pandemic has intensified the dilemma of how to communicate with people at risk of COVID-19 about their options, should the worst occur. 
Nobody should face pressure, but refraining from talking with them may actually prevent them from getting treatment that matches their wishes, she said.
""The difficulty in waiting is that many patients would benefit from consultation,"" Cave said. ""A failure to have such a conversation risks not respecting their views and breaching their rights."" 
Ethical issues around prioritising treatment of COVID-19 patients are also in German courts, where a lawsuit over triage rules - when hospitals become so overloaded that they must choose whom to treat and whom to leave to die - is pending. 
Plaintiffs with disabilities or underlying illness asked the Karlsruhe-based constitutional court to force the German government to establish such rules, fearing that otherwise they could be at a disadvantage. The court has expressed some doubts whether that this should be the government's role.
In Switzerland, COVID-19 numbers have exploded during the second infection wave, rising from 100,000 weeks ago to more than 290,000 cases on Friday, when 4,946 new infections were recorded. The death toll is at 3,575.
In the French-speaking region near Lake Geneva where infection rates are among Europe's highest, some hospitals have shifted patients elsewhere via helicopter, including the country's German-speaking north where the infection rate is lower, to free up ICU space.
So far, the system is stretched thin, but holding up, with spare ICU capacity in much of the country, official data shows.
""We are now under the 600 mark of hospitalised COVID patients,"" Bertrand Levrat, director of the Geneva University Hospital, told Reuters. ""It's a good step, but we're far from relaxing.""

In the past week, security forces detained three staff, including the director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), after 13 senior diplomats visited the group for a briefing on human rights on Nov. 3.
EIPR said all three have been ordered detained for 15 days on charges of joining a terrorist group and spreading false news, in what critics see as the latest escalation of an unprecedented clampdown on civil society and political dissent. 
Egypt's government has said EIPR was operating illegally.
""We are very concerned that the targeting of human rights defenders and other activists, as well as further restrictions on freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly imposed in the country, are having a profound chilling effect on an already weakened Egyptian civil society,"" Ravina Shamdasani of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told a briefing in Geneva. 
Several European countries whose diplomats attended the Nov. 3 meeting criticised the arrests in statements and on Twitter.
Bärbel Kofler, human rights commissioner for Germany's foreign ministry, said she was ""appalled"" by the arrests.
""I condemn this escalation in the way of dealing with Egyptian civil society in the strongest terms,"" she said in a statement.
A U.S. Department of State spokesman said Washington was ""very concerned"" by the latest detention, that of EIPR Executive Director Gasser Abdel Razek.
Antony Blinken, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's foreign policy adviser, tweeted: ""Meeting with foreign diplomats is not a crime. Nor is peacefully advocating for human rights."" 
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has overseen a extensive crackdown on political dissent that has steadily tightened in recent years.
Sisi has said there are no political prisoners in Egypt, that stability and security are paramount, and that the government supports human rights by providing basic needs such as jobs and housing.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan pop star and presidential candidate Bobi Wine, whose arrest this week triggered protests that led to at least 37 deaths, was released on bail on Friday after being charged with holding rallies likely to spread the coronavirus.
The violence comes as campaigns kick off ahead of January elections in the oil-rich East African nation, whose ageing leader Yoweri Musaveni is a staunch Western ally but faces accusations of corruption and nepotism at home, which he denies. 
Opposition leader Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was arrested on Wednesday while campaigning in eastern Uganda for allegedly holding mass rallies in violation of restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19. 
Uganda is due to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 14, with Wine emerging as a serious threat to Museveni, 76, who aims to extend his 34-year rule. 
Violence snowballed as authorities deployed the military across the capital Kampala and surrounding areas to help police forces disperse protesters they accuse of rioting and looting. Police said they used live bullets, tear gas and water cannon, and arrested nearly 600 people. 
Police pathologist Moses Byaruhanga told Reuters on Friday the death toll had jumped to 37.
SHOT IN THE BACK
Witnesses said they saw university and high school students gunned down in the streets.
Journalist Jocylynne Nakibuule, who works at local station Spark TV, said she had helped a 15-year-old boy shot in the back on Thursday. 
""I am a mother. When I saw the boy, my motherly instincts kicked in. I forgot all about the riots,"" Nakibuule said, adding that she took him to hospital on a motorbike taxi.
""He was bleeding constantly,"" Nakibuule said, sobbing. ""I kept calling his name, Amos, Amos, please fight to save the pain of your mother.""
The boy's mother told her that soldiers had shot at them as they came out of a shop, she said. 
Nakibuule went back to covering the protests. On Friday morning, the hospital told her the boy had died.
Fred Mpanga said his 21-year-old nephew, Yusuf Kimuli, was also killed after going to buy milk.
""Gunmen who were not in uniform and were in a private car moving around shooting people, they shot him in the back,"" Mpanga said. 
Kimuli lay in the street for more than an hour bleeding to death because people were afraid to help him, Mpanga said, citing accounts from witnesses who spoke to the family. 
""All the light has been snuffed out of my life."" 
It remains unclear who was responsible for the bloodshed. During the protests, a witness told Reuters that men in civilian clothes were walking around carrying assault rifles.
Multiple opposition parties have previously accused the government of using non-uniformed security personnel to quell riots. The government has denied those accusations.
ELECTIONS APPROACHING
Police spokesman Fred Enanga blamed the protesters, saying Wine's supporters targeted bystanders who do not support their National Unity Platform (NUP) party. 
""What we have seen in the last few days, that is violence, vandalism, looting, intimidation and threats, are crimes that were being committed (against) people who are not pro-NUP,"" he said. ""This is not something that we can tolerate.""
NUP spokesman Joel Senyonyi told Reuters the party condemned the looting and said it had urged supporters to protest peacefully.
In a televised court appearance on Friday, Wine blamed the president for the shootings: ""It is Museveni who is supposed to be in this dock for killing innocent citizens.""
Wine is popular among Ugandan youth, who often play songs in which he denounces government corruption.
Wine has said that being ""born hustling and born to hustling parents, raised in the ghettos"" meant he could understand the struggles of impoverished Ugandans. He has repeatedly urged Museveni to retire.
New York-based Human Rights Watch said authorities were ""weaponizing"" COVID-19 to suppress opposition ahead of the elections.

""This is just the beginning of the campaign season,"" said Oryem Nyeko, the group's Africa researcher. ""It seems to be a sign of things to come.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday that war-torn Yemen is in ""imminent danger of the worst famine the world has seen for decades,"" warning against any unilateral moves as the United States threatens to blacklist Yemen's Iran-allied Houthi group.
Aid workers have raised fears that if Washington designates the Houthis a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), it could prevent life-saving aid reaching the country.
""In this very fragile situation in relation to famine and in this hopeful moment in relation to conversations, we believe that any other unilateral initiative will probably not be positive. I don't think we should rock the boat at the present moment,"" Guterres told reporters when asked about U.S. plans.
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthi group. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country's suffering is also worsened by an economic and currency collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""In the absence of immediate action, millions of lives may be lost,"" Guterres said in a statement earlier on Friday.
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its population in need of help. 
A senior Western diplomat said an FTO designation of the Houthis by the United States ""would certainly not contribute to progress on Yemen.""
""It's likely that they want to do whatever it takes to increase the pressure on Iran,"" said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.

U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock has said the United Nations has received less than half of what was needed this year - about $1.5 billion - for its humanitarian operations in Yemen. Last year it received $3 billion.

(Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court on Friday declared unconstitutional two south Florida laws that banned therapists from offering conversion therapy to children struggling with their sexual orientation or gender identity.
In a 2-1 decision, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with two therapists who said the laws in the city of Boca Raton and Palm Beach County violated their free speech rights.
Circuit Judge Britt Grant said that while enjoining the laws ""allows speech that many find concerning--even dangerous,"" the First Amendment ""does not allow communities to determine how their neighbors may be counseled about matters of sexual orientation or gender.""
Conversion therapy aims to change people's sexual orientations or gender identities.
The therapists, Robert Otto and Julie Hamilton, said their clients typically had ""sincerely held religious beliefs conflicting with homosexuality,"" and sought counseling to conform their identities and behaviors with those beliefs.
Republican President Donald Trump appointed both judges in Friday's majority.
Circuit Judge Barbara Martin, appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama, dissented, citing a compelling interest in protecting children from a ""harmful therapeutic practice.""
In separate statements, Boca Raton's lawyer Jamie Cole and Palm Beach County's lawyer Helene Hvizd called the dissent ""well-reasoned,"" and said both were weighing their legal options.
Mat Staver, a lawyer for the therapists, called the decision the first of its kind by a federal appeals court, and ""a huge victory"" enabling people to choose counseling free of government censorship.
A June study by the Williams (NYSE:WMB) Institute at UCLA School of Law said 20 states and Washington, D.C. ban licensed healthcare professionals from conducting conversion therapy on children.
Critics say the practice stigmatizes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and is linked to depression, anxiety and suicide.
The American Psychiatric Association also opposes conversion therapy, saying the practice often assumes that homosexuality is a mental disorder.
Some supporters of the practice have offered religious justifications or said it is unethical not to offer clients that option.

The case is Otto et al v City of Boca Raton, Florida et al, 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 19-10604.

The Albatross Pub in Berkeley, founded in 1964 at the height of Beatlemania, has been unable to open since March. Without an outdoor space or a kitchen, the Albatross - a popular haunt with students and professors from the nearby university - has had to stay shut under local COVID-19 restrictions.
""You know it's not just a pub, it's not just a bar. A pub is short for public house. It's where people came to hang out and talk,"" said co-owner Andrew McGee, 52, who started working there as a doorman in 2004 and then as a bartender.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's interim President Francisco Sagasti said he will not push for a referendum on changing the country's constitution to solve a biting political crisis that has seen loud calls in street protests over recent weeks for major reform.
Sagasti, a centrist lawmaker, took the reins in the copper-producing nation this week amid some of Peru's most heated demonstrations against the political classes in decades, which saw huge protests in which two people killed and dozens injured.
He has managed to calm the waters in the short-term, but the country remains volatile with calls on the streets for changes to the constitution and an overhaul of Congress, especially amongst the country's youth.
Over three million Peruvians took to the streets in recent days, according to a poll by Ipsos. Some 90% disapprove of Congress and most do not identify with any political party.
Sagasti, however, cautioned in an interview with Reuters that there would be no rapid movement toward a referendum on the matter, as happened in neighboring Chile after violent protests last year. Chileans voted overwhelmingly to rewrite their own magna carta.
""We think this is a task for a new government, freely elected by the people,"" he said. ""We don't think this is a short-term priority,"" he said late on Thursday at the presidential palace in capital Lima.
Sagasti, whose term runs until July and includes helming the country to new elections planned for April, said that his government was focused on ""calming"" the current situation. 
Peru's constitution, created by strong-man Alberto Fujimori in 1993 after he shut down its then opposition-led Congress, is controversial and has been unable to avoid regular bouts of political upheaval that have dominated its politics for years.
Much of the momentum for constitutional change will depend on whether Peruvians continue to protest and whether political tensions remain between Congress and the executive. Some fear that impeachment will become a constant threat with a divided legislature, fostering uncertainty.
Peru's police has also been criticized for its handling of the protests that led to the rapid resignation of conservative leader Manuel Merino. Sagasti promised there would be ""no impunity"" for those responsible for the deaths and injuries, but stopped short of committing to police reform. 
""We will not leave unpunished in any way those who have committed these acts of violence and violation of human rights, but neither will we go to the other extreme saying that all the police are like that,"" he said. 
""We won't tarnish all the police because of the behavior of some elements.""
Sagasti criticized the country's top court for declining to hear a case that would have defined when a president can be impeached, saying some sort of guidance would have been ""useful for the political stability of the country""
RAISING DEBT
Sagasti said Peru is planning to raise new public debt in the short term in order to finance the Andean country's sky-high deficit and repay interest on old debt in 2021.
""Our country has the capacity to raise debt at interest rates that are relatively reasonable,"" Sagasti, 76, said late on Thursday evening in his first interview since taking office earlier this week amid a biting political crisis in the country.
""When one has space to raise debt and you are going through a crisis, that is what you have to do."" 
The former World Bank official became Peru's third president in a week after his predecessor resigned after six days in office and the country's much-reviled Congress ousted centrist Martin Vizcarra in an impeachment trial. 
Peru had been an economic success story for almost three decades, but the coronavirus pandemic has hit the country's mining-driven economy hard, pushing up poverty levels and driving it towards its biggest annual contraction in a century.
The government of Vizcarra had launched one of the region's biggest economic package to weather the coronavirus crisis, including cash transfers for the most vulnerable, even as mining production was hit by a lockdown.
The stimulus package will cost around 20% of Peru's pre-pandemic gross domestic product, though the economy is set to contract 12.5% this year and tax revenue has dipped 30%.

Sagasti says his interim administration is weighing the possibility of spending more on new cash transfers.

The independent experts urged the Baghdad government to immediately halt all mass executions, noting that 21 prisoners had been executed in October, followed by a further 21 last week in Nasiriyah Central Prison, also known as al Hoot.
The wave ""seems to be part of a larger plan to execute all prisoners on death row"", they said in a joint statement.
Some 4,000 prisoners, most of them charged with terrorism offences, are believed to be on death row in Iraq, the experts said. Hundreds of executions are imminent after their execution orders were signed off, they said.
""We strongly urge the Iraqi government to respect its international legal obligations and to immediately halt further plans to execute prisoners,” said the U.N. investigators, who focus on torture, arbitrary killings and protecting human rights while countering terrorism.
Trials under the Anti-Terrorism Law have been marked by alarming irregularities, they added. “Defendants have frequently been denied the most basic right to an adequate defence and their allegations of torture and ill-treatment during interrogations have not been investigated.” 
There was no immediate comment from the Iraqi government.
U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, in a statement issued last week after the execution of 21 men, called on Iraqi authorities to halt any further executions. 
Her office had found ""frequent violations of fair trial rights, ineffective legal representation, over-reliance on confessions and frequent allegations of torture"", she said.
The administration of justice underpins a functioning, democratic society, Bachelet added.

The government said that the country which suffered one of Europe's worst autumn outbreaks of the pandemic would move on Monday from the top risk level 5 to level 4 on its scale of curbs.
Elementary schools, open since Wednesday for first and second graders, will fully open for lower-grade pupils from Nov. 30, while the rest will return on a rotating basis. 
Some final-year high school students and some university students can return to presence learning on Wednesday. 
Level 4 also moves curfew and store closing hours to 11 p.m. from 9 p.m. and allows the assembly of six people instead of two.
Blatny, speaking at a news conference, also assured Czechs that stalls selling Christmas trees, decorations and live carp for traditional Christmas Eve dinners will be allowed.
Industry Minister Karel Havlicek said the risk level may drop to level 3 a week after next, which would allow the reopening of restaurants and retail, which is now mostly closed except for stores selling food, pharmacies and other essential goods.
The Health Ministry said hospitals may start gradually returning to providing suspended non-urgent care as of next week thanks to fewer patients and fewer infected personnel. As of Friday, 6,307 COVID-19 patients were in hospital. 
The country had over 5,000 daily cases over the past week, down by more than half from late October peaks, but still a level burdening hospital care.

The ""R"" number showing how many people get infected from an average infected person has dropped to about 0.7, suggesting a further drop in cases, but test positivity rates show the epidemic is not under control and community transmission continues, Blatny said.

LAS PALMAS, Spain (Reuters) - The Spanish government promised on Friday to set up camps and shelters for 7,000 people in the Canary Islands, to manage a surge in migrant arrivals that has overwhelmed local authorities and left thousands sleeping in the open. 
Judicial authorities visited the port of Arguineguin on Gran Canaria island after a local mayor denounced the ""subhuman conditions"" of more than 1,000 migrants still stranded on the dockside there, to assess the situation and determine whether the crisis has been mishandled. 
""We face a human tragedy and no one can or should look the other way,"" Defense Minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster RTVE. Her ministry has already turned over an old military warehouse for use as a camp for 800 people that opened this month.
Migration Minister Jose Luis Escriva told a news conference more temporary camps would be set up next month on the islands of Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Fuerteventura, where more than 90% of the migrants arrive, while the ministry keeps working on a more permanent solution.
Municipalities, the military and even private companies will temporarily hand over property for the camps and shelters for the 7,000 migrants, Escriva said.
Almost 17,000 people have reached the Canary Islands so far this year, more than 10 times last year's total, after making the dangerous Atlantic crossing from north Africa. Although that is far from a peak of some 32,000 migrant arrivals in the Canaries in 2006, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation.
Countries such as Morocco shut their borders in March, so many north Africans grew desperate after losing their income from tourism and headed for the Canaries. Repatriating them became increasingly difficult for the same reason, Spanish diplomatic sources said. 

An Interior Ministry source said that after repatriations dropped to practically zero following the border closures in March, ""we are now recovering the (repatriation) capacity"" and trying to prevent new arrivals.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union acknowledged on Friday that it lacks the capabilities to meet its goal - pushed most strongly by its biggest members - to become a standalone military power able to help NATO or deploy troops rapidly to regional crises.
Seeking to address major shortfalls, the EU's first annual defence review, presented to the bloc's defence ministers on Friday, found that only 60% of the national troops and weapons nominally available to NATO are in a fit state to be deployed.
EU governments are also reluctant to deploy those troops, the report found. Formal EU military missions receive just 7% of all EU states' military personnel committed worldwide, with problems generating troop levels, it said. 
While such EU weaknesses were largely known, because the bloc has never had the military strength to match its economic might, major EU governments including France, Germany, Italy and Spain hope the detailed review and public recognition of failures will be a watershed. 
""The EU does not have all the required military capabilities available in order to fulfil (its) level of ambition,"" said the report. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters: ""European defence suffers from fragmentation, duplication and insufficient operational engagement.""
Smaller member states including Greece, Sweden and Poland have sought to protect domestic armament industries, which leads to duplication in weapons output, thwarting coordination geared to the protection of the continent as a whole.
Meanwhile, tiny Belgium and Luxembourg are among the lowest military spenders in Europe, and Denmark has opted out of EU defence initiatives.
France and Germany also disagree on how far to develop EU military cooperation independent of the United States, by far the biggest power in NATO and Europe's effective security guarantor since World War Two.
But after four years of hostility towards NATO from U.S. President Donald Trump, the EU says it can no longer rely solely on the United States to solve crises in its neighbourhood.
The EU has been working since December 2017 to develop more firepower independently of the United States. The effort has been led by France, the EU's remaining major military power after Britain, which opposed such cooperation, left the bloc.
With a weapons development fund being set up, backed by 8 billion euros ($9.50 billion) from the EU budget for the first time next year, French President Emmanuel Macron has called for more ""sovereignty"" in the EU's ability to defend itself.
The 27-nation EU aims to draw up a military doctrine by 2022 to define future threats and ambitions.

The report, part of an EU strategy to develop self-standing military capacity over the next decade, urged EU governments to jointly produce six areas of weaponry and end costly national duplication, including focusing on a new battle tank, a patrol class surface ship and counter-drone technology.

Two weeks into the conflict, the United Nations said it was making plans for as many as 200,000 refugees fleeing into neighbouring Sudan, and made an urgent appeal for $200 million to assist them.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people have been killed and tens of thousands of refugees have fled from fighting in Tigray, raising questions of whether Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed can hold his ethnically diverse nation together.
""The illegal TPLF group have launched a rocket attack around 1:40 a.m. in Bahir Dar,"" the Amhara government's communications office said, referring to the Tigray People's Liberation Front. The rockets caused no damage, it said.
Bahir Dar, Amhara region's lakeside capital, is located hundreds of miles from the fighting in Tigray. Tigrayan refugees have told Reuters the Amhara militia is fighting on the government side, and the two regions have a border dispute.
A local journalist and another resident in Bahir Dar said they heard two explosions and had been told by people in the area that at least one missile hit near the airport.
HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY
Aid agencies fear a humanitarian emergency in Tigray, where hundreds of thousands of people depended on relief aid even before the conflict. Thousands of refugees have fled, some crowding into boats to cross a river to Sudan, overwhelming aid groups positioned on the other side.
""Together with all the agencies we have built a response plan for about 20,000 people and currently we are at about 31,000 so it has already surpassed that figure,"" U.N. refugee agency's (UNHCR) Axel Bisschop told a briefing in Geneva. ""The new planning figure is around 200,000.""
UNICEF's Sudan-based representative Abdullah Fadil voiced fears about the impact of the arrivals on Sudan, already hosting 1 million refugees from other African neighbours.
""Our serious concern is if we do not act quickly with the resources needed...this could unravel not only Ethiopia but also Sudan,"" he told the briefing.
Ethiopia, a federation of 10 ethnic regions, was dominated for decades by Tigrayans in a TPLF-led ruling coalition, until Abiy, who is of Amhara and Oromo descent, took power two years ago. He says he aims to share authority more fairly in the country. The TPLF accuses him of pursuing a vendetta against former officials.
The conflict erupted two weeks ago after what the government called a TPLF attack on army forces stationed in the region.
Tigray forces accused the government of bombing a university in the Tigray capital Mekelle on Thursday. There was no immediate response from the government, although officials have said they are attacking only military targets. 
It has been impossible to verify assertions on all sides because telephone lines and internet links to Tigray have been severed since the conflict began.
On Thursday, Ethiopia said it was closing in on Mekelle, which the rebels have said they will defend.
A week ago, Tigray forces fired rockets at two airports in Amhara. They have also fired at rockets into the neighbouring nation of Eritrea, which has a long-running enmity with the TPLF leadership. Eritrea made peace with Ethiopia in 2018, earning Abiy the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Reports of ethnically motivated killings have emerged during the conflict. Rights group Amnesty International documented a mass killing of civilians, many of whom appeared to be Amhara, by what it says were Tigrayan forces on Nov. 9-10, which the Tigray authorities denied. Refugees fleeing into Sudan have said they were targeted for being Tigrayan.
Since taking power, Abiy has freed political prisoners and loosened what was once one of the most repressive political and economic systems in Africa. But the new freedoms have been accompanied by bouts of violence as regional bosses vie with each other and the government for power, money and land. 

Mountainous Tigray accounts for only about 5% of the population but long dominated the security services. Tigrayans spearheaded a conflict that toppled a Communist regime in 1991.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday backed one of his most senior ministers after a damning inquiry into allegations that she bullied her staff concluded she had broken rules, including shouting and swearing at them.
Johnson's defence of Home Secretary Priti Patel prompted the author of the report, independent adviser Alex Allan, to resign.
Patel had not met the standards set under Britain's Ministerial Code which states ministers should treat officials with respect, Allan had concluded. Ministers usually step down if they are found to be in breach of the code.
However, a government statement said Johnson judged the code had not been breached, saying that concerns had not been raised at the time and that Patel was unaware of the impact of her actions. She apologised for any upset she may have caused.
""The prime minister has full confidence in the home secretary and considers this matter now closed,"" the statement said.
The issue comes at a difficult time for Johnson, who is trying to reset his government after his top adviser Dominic Cummings left Downing Street last week. His leadership and judgment has also been called into question over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Patel was a leading supporter of Brexit before the 2016 referendum and is popular in the ruling Conservative Party. She is now the minister responsible for crime, security and immigration where she has advocated a hardline stance.
The daughter of immigrants herself, she previously had to quit as aid minister in 2017 because she held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials.
​
RIGHT TO RESIGN
Immediately after Johnson cleared Patel, Allan quit and opponents accused the prime minister of giving the green light to bullying. Johnson himself had written in the foreword to the Ministerial Code's latest version that ""there must be no bullying and no harassment"".
""I recognise that it is for the prime minister to make a judgment on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the Ministerial Code,"" Allan said. ""But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position."" 
Johnson's government has had an uneasy relationship with senior officials, with several leaving their posts since his election win last December, as part of what was viewed as Cummings' desire to shake up the civil service.
Patel had been accused of demeaning her staff, prompting Johnson to launch an inquiry in March to establish the facts. 
In a summary of his advice, Allan found that Patel had become ""justifiably in many instances"" frustrated by her department's lack of support, and this had ""manifested itself in forceful expression, including some occasions of shouting and swearing"".
""Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals,"" Allan's advice said. ""To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the Ministerial Code, even if unintentionally.""
Patel said it had never been her intention to upset anyone.
""I am sorry that my behaviour in the past has upset people,"" she said in a statement. ""I acknowledge that I am direct and have at times got frustrated. I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his support.
Colleagues rallied round her, describing her as kind and courteous.
However, Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said he would have sacked her and demanded the report be published in full.

""Yet again, the prime minister has been found wanting when his leadership has been tested,"" Starmer said in a statement. ""It is hard to imagine another workplace in the UK where this behaviour would be condoned by those at the top.""

BRCKO, Bosnia (Reuters) - Mirsad Zahirovic is a university-educated journalist and activist who moonlights as a waiter because he is not a member of one of the ruling political parties, which is almost the only way to get a job in his native Bosnia. 
The 28-year-old belongs to ""the children of Dayton"", a generation named after the peace agreement signed 25 years ago at a U.S. air force base in Dayton, Ohio. The accord ended three-and-a-half years of ethnic warfare in Bosnia that killed 100,000 people and forced 2 million from their homes.
Zahirovic, who has made a documentary film about the Dayton generation, doesn't see much benefit from those 25 years of peace. 
""The only good thing from Dayton is that it stopped the war,"" he said. 
Bosnia is marking the 25th anniversary of Dayton on Saturday without much fanfare, politically polarised as ethnic rivals squabble over whether to leave the settlement as it is or revise the constitution, which is part of the accords.
The U.S.-brokered peace deal ended hostilities between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) by splitting the country into two ethnically divided entities, linked via a weak central government. 
NEUTRAL DISTRICT
Several years later, the northern town of Brcko was declared a neutral district outside the jurisdiction of the two regions, and was hailed as Bosnia's biggest success as refugees from all ethnic groups returned and the economy blossomed.
But after an initial burst of economic growth following Dayton, Bosnia has stagnated as investors began to avoid a country held back by red tape and corruption. Bosnia has for years been at the bottom of the Transparency International corruption index, its score steadily dropping since 2012.
There has also been a massive exodus of young people - Bosnia had the biggest brain drain in the world along with Haiti and Venezuela in the 2018 Global Competitiveness Report released by the World Economic Forum.
""The people here want hope,"" said U.S. Ambassador Eric Nelson. ""There is a (European Union) road map to the future and a strong support for Bosnia-Herzegovina accomplishing that goal.""
""But actions need to take place here, and that's going to require leaders to stop thinking only of narrow political interests, ... and start thinking about long-term progress of this country,"" Nelson said.
The stagnation is visible in Brcko, where few are optimistic about the future.

""The situation is difficult, nothing has changed since the war ended, political parties still produce the same propaganda, there is no progress,"" said Jasmin Jukan, a Bosniak, having his regular afternoon beer with a Serb neighbour.

Combi Lift, which signed the contract three months after a huge quantity of poorly stored chemicals erupted in a mushroom cloud, will remove ""flammable and highly reactive"" chemicals from 49 containers at the port, the caretaker prime minister's office said in a statement sent to Reuters.
At least some of the chemicals the German firm will remove had been in storage at the port since 2009, although the statement did not give precise details.
The fact that it took about three months since the blast to sign a deal to remove dangerous material still left at the shattered port, which lies in the heart of Beirut, will add to public frustration and a sense of political drift in a nation whose economy has imploded after years of mismanagement and corruption.
Many Lebanese, particularly those who lost homes or who are still working on repairs since the Aug. 4 blast, are angry that results of an investigation have yet to be released.
""One hundred days after the national tragedy of the Beirut port explosion, one hundred days of investigation engaging serious international expertise and still no clarity, no accountability, no justice,"" U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, Jan Kubis, tweeted on Nov. 13.
He briefed the U.N. Security Council about Lebanon, citing a lack of clarity about the probe despite ""numerous appeals and petitions of citizenry"" for an impartial investigation.
The cabinet quit after the blast but is still acting in a caretaker role, as Lebanon's top politicians, many of whom have been in and out of power for decades under a sectarian power-sharing system, have yet to agree on forming a new government.
The state news agency had said on Wednesday a contract with Combi Lift was signed. It did not give the details that were later provided to Reuters.
The ammonium nitrate that exploded in August had been unloaded at the port in 2014. The authorities ignored several warnings by officials about the dangers of storing the material there.

The authorities have detained 25 people, including port and customs officials, and say the probe is moving as fast as possible.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - After three years, Marton Pal and his partner Adam Hanol received the phone call they had been waiting for in 2018 and a few months later they adopted Andris, a smart and lively boy who has since turned four.
As a Hungarian same-sex couple, the only way to adopt was if Pal applied as a single person. During interviews they told the adoption agency that they were in fact a couple. After 6 months, he got the permission.
In the same year they decided Andris should have a brother or sister, and this time Hanol applied. They have been waiting since November 2018 for the phone to ring again.
Now they fear that call will never come, since Hungary's nationalist government is putting forward legislation that would practically ban adoption by same-sex couples in what rights groups have said is an attack on the LGBTQ community.
The legislation says single people can only adopt with special permission from the minister in charge of family affairs. Even though Hanol has a valid permit, they think their chances have now diminished.
""Andris has been a miracle, that we could have him in our lives, so we are very grateful for that ... but I think our chances have deteriorated now,"" Pal said, playing with Andris in a leafy playground on the Buda side of the Danube.
""Anybody dealing with arranging adoption is at least in waiting mode now, or rather afraid to offer children to couples like us or single people,"" Hanol added. They won't give up though.
The government, which has stepped up anti-LGBTQ rhetoric as the coronavirus crisis hit the economy, has also proposed a constitutional amendment that declares ""the basis for family relations is marriage ... The mother is a woman, the father is a man.""
GENDER 
In May, Hungary banned gender changes in personal documents and has taken issue with children's books that portray diversity positively.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's cabinet chief Gergely Gulyas told a briefing that ""the physical and mental development of a child is ensured if he has a father and a mother"", adding that there could be exceptions and that's why the bill allows single people to adopt as well. 
Lydia Gall, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the legislation encouraged intolerance.
""This latest attack on the LGBT community in Hungary really shows the importance and emergency of why EU funds should be linked to the respect for rule of law and our common European values,"" Gall said, referring to a debate in the EU after Hungary and its ally Poland vetoed the bloc's budget.
Hungary and Poland, where the ruling party made campaigning against gay rights a key part of its ideology, refuse to back the EU's financial plan because the money is conditional on respecting the rule of law.
For same-sex couples in Hungary, the government's domestic campaign and increasing homophobia are a life-changer.
Balint Meiszterics, who planned to apply for adoption with his partner next year, said he was angry and sad at the same time, as the new bill could stop them having a family.
""The message here is ... that the government has an idea how a family should look like, how a true Hungarian looks like, and those who do not fit this have no place here,"" he said.

487,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>","Special Report: When cops and America's cherished gun rights clash, cops win","By Lawrence Hurley, Andrew Chung and Andrea Januta
LEESBURG, Florida (Reuters) - The night a cop killed Andrew Scott started out like many others had for the 26-year-old pizzeria worker. Home from his evening shift, he and his girlfriend, Miranda Mauck, ate a late supper and spent several hours watching television and playing video games.
Then, around 1:30 a.m., as the two sat talking in T-shirts and underwear, they were startled by a loud knock at the door. We “looked at each other and jumped up real fast,” Mauck said in an interview.
As they rushed to throw on some clothes, the knocking came again. Scott grabbed the 9mm semi-automatic pistol he kept at home for the couple’s safety. With Mauck close behind, Scott approached the door, which had no peephole. He opened it with his right hand, the gun in his left.
They barely had time to take in the four sheriff’s deputies standing at the door with guns drawn when six shots rang out. “They didn’t even say anything, they just started shooting,” Mauck said.
Three bullets struck Scott. He stumbled backward and collapsed onto the sofa where minutes earlier he and Mauck had sat playing video games. “They shot me. They fucking shot me. I’m dying,” he said, according to Mauck.
The shooter, Lake County Sheriff’s Deputy Richard Sylvester, and his three fellow officers had made a fatal error. They had the wrong place. They had trailed a suspect in an alleged assault to the Blueberry Hills apartment complex on the outskirts of Leesburg, Florida, about 50 miles northwest of Orlando. The suspect, who the officers believed was armed, had parked his motorcycle in front of Scott’s apartment, its engine still warm.
Despite that mistake, Sylvester was not disciplined or criminally charged in the July 15, 2012, killing.
""A FATEFUL DECISION"" 
Mauck and Scott’s parents filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Sylvester and the sheriff’s office, accusing the deputy of violating Scott’s civil rights under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects against illegal search and seizure. Judge Anne Conway let Sylvester off the hook, too. Her main reason: Scott’s gun.
“Andrew Scott made a fateful decision that night: he chose to answer his door with a gun in his hand. That changed everything. That is the one thing that — more than anything else — led to this tragedy,” Conway wrote in her Sept. 18, 2014, decision to toss out the lawsuit.
Conway’s ruling lays bare a sometimes tragic conflict inherent in the U.S. legal system. This conflict, fostered by the Supreme Court in recent years, pits Americans’ cherished gun rights against formidable legal protections for police accused of excessive force in the country with the most heavily armed citizenry in the world. When that conflict plays out in court, as it did in the Scott case, cops often win.
The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guaranteed Scott’s right to have a gun. Under a landmark 2008 Supreme Court ruling, District of Columbia v. Heller, he had an explicit right to keep and use a gun for self-defense at home.
None of that mattered, in the end. It was trumped by Sylvester’s claim that he was protected by qualified immunity, a controversial legal doctrine the Supreme Court created 50 years ago to shield police and other government officials from civil liability for actions undertaken on the job.
In her decision, Conway determined that Sylvester was legally justified to use deadly force because Scott was holding a gun, and that the officer was thus entitled to immunity. Conway’s decision was later upheld by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The courts’ rulings meant, in effect, that Scott gave up his Fourth Amendment rights when he exercised his Second Amendment rights.
Police using deadly force against lawfully armed civilians is an inevitable result of having an “armed society” in the United States, said Adam Winkler, a professor at the UCLA School of Law and an expert on gun policy. “When you have a right to have arms, you have a right to carry around something other people would see as a threat,” Winkler said. “Generally, we allow police officers to use force when they feel threatened. And merely possessing a gun raises that threat.”
THE IMMUNITY HURDLE
In an investigation published in May, Reuters revealed that federal appeals courts have in recent years been granting qualified immunity at an increasing rate to cops sued for excessive force — even when courts determine that police actually did use excessive force. The increase largely reflects the impact of a series of Supreme Court interventions that have made it harder for plaintiffs to breach the immunity defense, prompting widespread calls for the doctrine to be reined in or eliminated altogether on the grounds that it denies justice to victims of police brutality.
Hundreds of appellate court cases Reuters analyzed show that judges granted immunity to cops more often when they used force against a person with a gun — in 55% of cases, compared to 45% when the person was unarmed. Of course, the details of those cases vary greatly, some of them involving violent criminals in chaotic and dangerous encounters with police.
Still, Reuters found multiple cases in which courts granted immunity to cops who killed armed civilians who posed a questionable threat, including people who legally possessed guns for self-defense at home. In all the cases, officers said they acted reasonably in what they perceived to be dangerous situations.
--On June 28, 2013, two Pennsylvania state troopers, responding to a domestic disturbance call, shot and killed 50-year-old Shawn Knight. Relatives told the officers upon arrival that the situation had calmed down, but when one cop entered the house unannounced and without a warrant, he awakened a napping Knight, who emerged holding two guns. One of the officers who fired said Knight was pointing a gun at him. Other witnesses disputed that.
--On Sept. 12, 2016, a Santa Clara Sheriff’s Department officer shot and killed Eugene Craig after the officer and three others conducting a wellness check on the 86-year-old – he and his wife hadn’t been answering their phone – forced their way into his California home and encountered him holding his revolver as he came around a corner. The officer said Craig was pointing the gun at him.
--On Oct. 4, 2011, a New Mexico State Police officer shot and killed Samuel Pauly in his home in Glorieta, New Mexico. Pauly, 34, and his brother, Daniel, announced they were armed as three officers, investigating an earlier road rage incident involving Daniel, approached the home. The officers said that Daniel Pauly fired his weapon and that Samuel Pauly pointed his gun at one of them. Daniel Pauly said the brothers did not know the men were cops.
--On Dec. 9, 2011, police in Lafayette, Louisiana, were responding to a 911 call when they encountered Quamaine Mason as the 21-year-old was leaving his girlfriend’s apartment. Mason, who had a gun in his waistband, raised his hands and then lowered them when a police dog leapt at him, and the officer handling the dog shot Mason seven times, killing him.
--On Jan. 16, 2015, an off-duty Houston cop shot and killed Phillip Garcia Jr after the 26-year-old grabbed a handgun for protection from his car during a fight outside a sports bar. Witnesses said Garcia didn’t point the gun at anyone, and one said Garcia had his hands above his head when confronted by the officer. A court determined that the threat Garcia posed was questionable, but granted the officer immunity on the grounds that Garcia didn’t drop the gun when ordered to do so.
Cases like these are why some gun rights advocates want qualified immunity to be reined in. “These cases are rare, but they shouldn’t happen at all. When they do happen, law enforcement should be held liable,” said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, a Bellevue, Washington-based group that filed a brief in support of Mauck and the Scott family’s failed attempt to appeal their case to the Supreme Court. Gottlieb said police officers should not be able to cite the mere presence of a gun as a threat that justifies the use of deadly force.
Another gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, based in Sacramento, California, also favors reform of qualified immunity, Director of Legal Strategy Adam Kraut told Reuters. The National Rifle Association, the most influential U.S. gun rights group, did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.
UNLIKELY ALLIES
In their opposition to qualified immunity, gun rights groups, typically supportive of police, find themselves allied with a broad coalition spanning the political spectrum, including gun control advocates.
Everytown for Gun Safety, a group financed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that pushes for stricter gun controls, says that making it easier to hold cops accountable for excessive force could help reduce gun violence. If cops knew they might be held financially liable for their actions, the thinking goes, they might be less inclined to escalate in encounters with armed civilians.
Some high-profile incidents that have become rallying cries in the Black Lives Matter movement have helped draw public attention to the clash of policing and the Second Amendment.
Last year, a cop in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed Atatiana Jefferson, a Black woman, through a window in her home after she heard noises outside and picked up her handgun. In a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, a police officer in 2016 shot and killed Philando Castile, a Black man, during a routine traffic stop just after Castile revealed he was licensed to carry a gun. And in Louisville, Kentucky, in a case dominating headlines this year, cops executing a no-knock warrant in March shot and killed Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, in her home after her boyfriend fired his gun in self-defense.
These cases, amid national media attention and public outrage, led to criminal charges against the cops involved and large settlements for the Taylor and Castile families.
MORE GUNS THAN PEOPLE
The United States bristles with guns — nearly 400 million, or about 1.2 guns for every resident, according to the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey. About 40% of Americans say they live in a household with a gun, according to surveys. The firearms industry has seen record sales this year, driven by first-time buyers unsettled by the coronavirus pandemic and mass protests against systemic racism and aggressive policing after the death in May of George Floyd, a Black man, under the knee of a Minneapolis cop.
The prevalence of guns in American society makes the jobs of police all the more difficult and dangerous. Researchers at Harvard University and elsewhere have shown that both killings of police and police shootings of civilians are more likely in states with higher rates of gun ownership.
Law enforcement’s attitudes toward gun control are complicated. The Major Cities Chiefs Association, whose membership includes top cops in Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, advocates for stronger controls. Elsewhere, law enforcement publicly voices support for gun rights. The Fraternal Order of Police, which represents rank-and-file officers nationwide, supports both qualified immunity and the Second Amendment, said spokeswoman Jessica Cahill. She declined to provide details on the group’s position.
On qualified immunity, police are unequivocal. They say it allows them to do their jobs without having to stop and second-guess themselves in fast-moving, perilous situations in which their lives or the lives of others are at risk.
Despite growing public demands that qualified immunity be curbed, Congress and the Supreme Court have so far failed to act. The protests after the death of George Floyd prompted Democrat-led efforts in Congress to end qualified immunity. Those initiatives fizzled out in the face of opposition from the administration of President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, who said eliminating qualified immunity would prevent police from doing their jobs. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, avoided the issue this year, declining to take up multiple cases aimed at dialing back the doctrine.
FAMILIAR WITH FIREARMS
Leesburg, a city of around 20,000 people, and surrounding Lake County are gun country. The central Florida landscape of pine scrub is dotted with lakes and retirement communities — and gun stores. On its website, the Lake County Sheriff’s Office displays a Florida Sheriffs Association proclamation in support of the Second Amendment.
Andrew Scott was familiar with guns. His father, John Scott, worked for 26 years as a corrections officer in Florida, Tennessee and Michigan, and he always kept a gun at home. Andrew “knew to respect it. He knew they were dangerous,” John Scott said.
Andrew Scott and Miranda Mauck met in early 2010 while both were working at Hungry Howie’s pizzeria. Mauck was charmed by the 6-foot, 300-pound “teddy bear” who could always make her laugh. He liked to build computers from scratch and “was really good with the nerdy stuff,” she said. She moved into his one-bedroom apartment two months later.
The couple struggled to make ends meet. Mauck picked up extra cash from babysitting gigs after quitting her job at the pizzeria, but the couple still relied on food stamps. At the time of his death, Scott had $100 in his bank account, Mauck said in her deposition in her lawsuit.
They also worried about security at the Blueberry Hills apartments. Homeless people often roamed among the low-rise buildings, Mauck said. About a month before Scott was killed, she said, “some random person” was knocking on apartment doors and stole the lightbulb from their front-door lamp.
When a good friend offered Scott a handgun, he took it. In Florida, among the least restrictive states for acquiring and keeping firearms, the private transfer of that gun was legal, and Scott needed no permit to keep it at home. Scott had four criminal charges on his record — three misdemeanors and one felony drug possession charge later reduced to a misdemeanor — but no convictions, so the Florida law prohibiting felons from owning guns did not apply.
The night Scott opened the door on Sylvester and the three other Lake County deputies, he did so lawfully. At that instant, Mauck said, “pure chaos” erupted. Seconds later, she tried to run to Scott’s side as he lay bleeding on the sofa, she said, but one of the deputies held her back, hustled her outside and put her in a squad car, where she was kept for several hours. In her deposition, she said one of the cops at the scene seemed amused by her T-shirt, which bore the words: “It’s all fun and games until the cops show up.”
A Lake County Sheriff’s Office investigation of the incident “found that the shooting was consistent with agency policy and the agency’s use-of-force training,” said an office spokesman. A Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation yielded no conclusive findings, and Assistant State Attorney Richard Ridgway stated in a Sept. 25, 2012, memorandum that “the shooting was legally justified under Florida law.”
Sylvester is still a deputy with the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, which declined to make him available for an interview.
THE USUAL ROUTE
Soon after Mauck and Scott’s parents filed their federal excessive force lawsuit against Sylvester and the sheriff’s office, Sylvester did what most cops do in his situation: He asked Judge Conway to throw out the case on the grounds that he was entitled to qualified immunity.
Conway now conducted the two-part analysis judges apply when cops request immunity: whether the force used was reasonable in the circumstances or clearly excessive and in violation of the plaintiff’s constitutional rights, and whether police should have known at the time that their actions violated “clearly established” legal precedent.
This test, opponents of qualified immunity say, sets too high a bar for plaintiffs to hold cops accountable for killing or seriously injuring civilians. Supreme Court interventions in recent years in favor of police have only raised that bar higher — in particular, by requiring that the details of a case be nearly identical to any clearly established precedent.
Deputy Sylvester, in his deposition, said Scott was aiming directly at him, an acute threat that his lawyers said justified his decision to fire. Mauck testified — and maintains to this day — that Scott was holding the gun at his side, pointed downward.
Judge Conway ruled that even if Scott were not pointing the gun at Sylvester, the officer’s actions were reasonable in the “tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving situation” and thus did not violate Scott’s rights. Even if the shooting had violated Scott’s constitutional rights, she continued, no precedent clearly established that it was unlawful for Sylvester to shoot when confronted by a homeowner holding a gun.
Mauck and Scott’s family appealed to the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which on Oct. 21, 2015, issued a one-paragraph ruling upholding Conway’s decision.
The plaintiffs sought a rehearing by the full appellate court. The court on March 16, 2017, rejected that request, but it split 7-4 in its decision.
Judge Frank Hull, writing for the majority, said that Sylvester and his fellow deputies did nothing wrong when they knocked without announcing themselves and that, besides, Scott could have chosen not to open the door. After Scott opened the door, Hull reasoned, Sylvester violated no clearly established law when he shot and killed the young man.
Hull cited 11th Circuit precedents, including a 2009 ruling in which the court said: “We look at the fact pattern from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene with knowledge of the attendant circumstances and facts, and balance the risk of bodily harm to the suspect against the gravity of the threat the officer sought to eliminate.”
""TRAGIC POLICE SHOOTINGS""
In an impassioned dissent, Judge Beverly Martin said the court “gave a pass to dangerous unconstitutional police actions in a way that makes it more likely that tragic police shootings will continue to occur.”
The idea that Sylvester was justified in firing because Scott was holding a gun “clearly infringes” on the Second Amendment, Martin wrote, citing District of Columbia v. Heller.
“If Mr. Scott was subject to being shot and killed, simply because … he made the ‘fateful decision’ to answer a late-night disturbance at the door to his house and did so while holding his firearm pointed safely at the ground, then the Second Amendment … had little effect,” Martin wrote. She concluded that Sylvester had clearly violated Scott’s Fourth Amendment rights by conducting a warrantless raid and using excessive force.
Martin noted that the 11th Circuit itself had ruled in a 2016 case that the fact that someone simply possesses a gun does not give police officers license to use deadly force. Other federal appeals courts have set similar precedents.
The plaintiffs then petitioned the Supreme Court to hear their appeal to deny Sylvester immunity. By this time, gun rights activists were on the case. The Second Amendment Foundation filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to intervene, complaining that lower courts often fail to take into account gun rights when assessing police conduct.
“That the court below would shift the blame from Sylvester to his victim, for the latter’s deigning to access the Second Amendment, is but the latest episode in the courts’ struggle to describe the relationship between the right to keep and bear arms and the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures,” the brief said.
In January 2018, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. The case was over.
It was a crushing disappointment for Mauck. She had hoped a court victory would lead to local police reform, such as training to ensure officers announce themselves when knocking on doors.
In the aftermath of the shooting, Mauck struggled with depression, and she is visited daily by memories of “goofy, playful” Scott. She worked for a while at a Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT) gym, and recently started a baked-goods business out of her home called Sweets and Treats.
She remains a firm supporter of Second Amendment rights, owns a gun, and believes that a cop’s fear should not be allowed to override the Constitution. “Andrew was within his and my rights to come to that door with a firearm,” she said. “You don’t get to take that from us because someone was scared.”

488,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Mekelle: conflict returns to Ethiopian city steeped in legacy of war,"By Maggie Fick
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Mekelle, a city nestled in the arid, mountainous Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, is steeped in the lore of its guerrilla fighters, who marched in sandals to Addis Ababa to topple a Communist dictatorship in 1991.
Now, war is returning to a place where rusting tanks, small airplanes, and military equipment are displayed outside the museum, and the Tigrayan legacy of armed struggle is never far away. 
Towering monuments all over town honour martyrs and sacrifices Tigrayans endured through an uprising that lasted longer than a decade. It was to be followed by an even worse 1998-2000 war against the neighbouring nation of Eritrea over a border dispute. Thousands of young Tigrayans and conscripts from all over the country died in trenches and minefields.
Though Tigrayans make up just 5% of Ethiopia's population, their leading role in the 1991 revolution gave them sway over the country in the decades that followed, until Prime Minister Ahmed Abiy took power two years ago.
Two weeks ago the central government launched an assault on Tigray to capture its leaders, after what Addis Ababa called a surprise attack by regional forces on army troops stationed in the region. After two weeks of fighting, the government says its forces are now advancing towards Mekelle. 
Since the fighting erupted, a communications blackout has made it impossible for most media to reach Mekelle or speak with civilians there.
When Reuters visited the region two years ago, Mekelle's streets bustled with yellow three-wheeled motorized tuk-tuks and cars. People sipped Ethiopian coffee in outdoor cafes, speakers blaring songs in the local Tigrinya language.
But there was already a sense of defiance in the air. Abiy had ordered the arrest of Tigrayan former officials accused of corruption and human rights abuses. Residents, who would discuss politics mainly on condition of anonymity in a country with a long history of repression, said Tigrayans would not accept ""humiliation"".
""Nobody will kneel down here,"" a tour guide said.
On Thursday, Tigray forces accused the government of bombing a university in Mekelle. There was no immediate response from the government, although officials have said they are only attacking military targets.
The government says it blames the region's Tigray People's Liberation Front leadership for the conflict, and not Tigrayans, or even the TPLF more generally.
“There could be members of TPLF that are innocent, also the special forces, the young population,"" said Mulu Nega, named head of an interim government for the region by the federal authorities this week.
DEFIANT CITY
Mekelle's wide boulevards and electricity lines stretching into the rural countryside are testament to the TPLF's power when the party led Ethiopia's ruling coalition from 1991 until Abiy took power in 2018. The town has some of the best infrastructure of any Ethiopian city outside Addis Ababa. 
Though most Tigrayans are subsistence farmers, Mekelle has a handful of upmarket hotels with gaudy chandeliers, and a modern airport, normally with several flights per day to the capital.
In a statement this week, the TPLF said hardships are part of life in wartime. It promised to give Ethiopian troops ""hell"" on its home turf.
When Tigray held regional elections in September in defiance of the federal government, the TPLF won by a landslide. Journalists were not permitted to travel there, but voters contacted remotely expressed pride in the TPLF's role ending the Communist dictatorship of the 1980s and putting Ethiopia on a path to economic prosperity and stability in the decades since.
The TPLF is celebrated in Mekelle as liberators and war heroes, and billboards keep decades-old memories fresh. Abiy's face, ubiquitous on posters and bumper stickers in many parts of Ethiopia during the heady beginning of his premiership, never became a prominent fixture there.
The government acknowledges the difficulty it would have in winning over a population that has so long revered the TPLF.

""To separate this people from this party we need to conduct more communications and public relations work, because the people should understand the reality,"" Mulu said.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>","With applause and flowers, thousands attend funeral of Belarusian protester","By Matthias Williams (NYSE:WMB)
KYIV (Reuters) - Thousands of people silently raised their arms in the air, held flowers aloft and broke into chants outside a church in Minsk on Friday at the funeral of a Belarusian protester.
The death of 31-year-old Roman Bondarenko has become the latest flashpoint in months-long mass protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. He died in hospital last week after what protesters say was a severe beating by security forces.
The interior ministry denied responsibility. The death was condemned by the European Union who on Thursday announced new sanctions on Minsk in response to state repression against protesters following a disputed August election.
His opponents accuse Lukashenko of rigging the election to extend his 26-year grip on power. He denies electoral fraud and, backed by Russia, has refused to resign.
The crowd outside the church, the majority wearing masks, chanted ""I'm going out"", the last known written words of Bondarenko, and ""long live Belarus"".
Cars blared their horns in the street. Thousands broke into applause as the coffin was carried out of the church.
The authorities this week detained a medic who leaked a medical report of Bondarenko's death to the media. The medical report showed there was no alcohol in Bondarenko's bloodstream, casting doubt on the government's assertion that Bondarenko had been drunk and died in a scuffle with civilians.
The Prosecutor General's office opened a criminal investigation into the medic for revealing medical secrets, spreading false information and fueling tensions in society. A journalist who published the report was also detained.
The EU has already imposed travel bans and asset freezes on almost 50 Belarusian officials. The new sanctions are expected to target more senior officials and also entities that finance Lukashenko and his government.
United Nations human rights experts said on Thursday they were gravely concerned by increased reports of mass detentions, intimidation and torture. They called on the Belarusian authorities to investigate the excessive use of force and unlawful retaliation at peaceful protests.

Tens of thousands of people have staged regular protests for weeks since the election. Some workers at major state-run companies went on strike. This week, potash producer Belaruskali said 49 workers had been fired for taking part in the strike.

Chin'ono's arrest and that of dozens of activists in the last four months has led to accusations that President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government was persecuting opponents, a charge the authorities deny.
Chin'ono, who has criticised the government on social media, was first arrested in July on charges of inciting violent anti-government protests. 
He denies the separate charges and says the government is persecuting him for exposing corruption.

High Court Judge Tawanda Chitapi found on Friday that a lower court had erred in denying Chin'ono bail, but said the journalist should not use his Twitter account to post messages that obstructed justice.

Authorities launched the operation from the southeastern province of Diyarbakir and sought suspects across four cities and a total of 106 residential addresses, the source said.
Seventy-four suspects have already been detained, the source said.
The suspects were believed to be connected to the Democratic Society Congress, which the source and Anadolu defined as the legislative arm of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group.
Anadolu said the authorities found guns, documents and digital material at the suspects' addresses.
Milena Buyum, Turkey campaigner for Amnesty International, said the lawyers' detentions clashed with recent talk of judicial reforms, which have also been mentioned by President Tayyip Erdogan.
On Thursday, Erdogan's close ally and former deputy prime minister, Bulent Arinc, emphasised the importance of the justice system in an interview.
""These raids are the opposite of the kind of reform that Arinc spoke of only last night, where detention is exceptional and judges take 'pro-freedom decisions,'"" Buyum wrote on Twitter.
She said the DTK was a Kurdish umbrella organisation for civil society.
The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, has fought against the state in the southeast since 1984. A ceasefire collapsed in 2015.
The Ankara state prosecutor's office ordered the detention of 60 people in September, including 48 lawyers and others in the legal sector, suspected of operating in support of the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. That drew criticism from Turkish and international lawyers' groups.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Two Thai high school student leaders will be charged for joining a banned protest last month, police said on Friday, a day after embattled Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha threatened tougher action against protesters.
The students said they had been summoned for violating an emergency decree by joining a protest on Oct. 15, when tens of thousands of people defied a ban by Prayuth aimed at halting protests demanding his removal and reforms of the monarchy.
""Even if you arrest protest leaders, there is not enough space in prison because hundreds more will rise up,"" one of the students, 15-year Benjamaporn Nivas, told Reuters in an instant message. 
The ""Bad Student"" group is planning a protest on Saturday and Benjamaporn said she would still attend. The other member of the group who faces charges is Lopanapat Wangpaisit, 17.
Police spokesman Yingyos Thepjumnong said the two were summoned to acknowledge the charge and would be questioned in the presence of their parents and lawyer.
Youth- and student-led protests since July have become the greatest challenge to Thailand's establishment in years and dozens of arrests and attempts to quell them have so far only brought more people into the streets.
Prayuth has refused the protesters' demand to resign and rejected their accusation that he engineered last year's election to keep power he seized in a 2014 coup.
Protesters also seek to redraw the constitution written by his former junta and curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, saying the monarchy has enabled decades of military domination.
The Royal Palace has made no comment since the protests began.
On Thursday, Prayuth threatened to use all laws to prosecute protesters who break them, raising concerns among activists that this could also mean harsh royal insult laws under which there have been no prosecutions for more than two years.
Although demonstrations have largely been peaceful, police used teargas and water cannons against protesters on Tuesday. At least 55 were injured from tear gas and six from gunshot wounds. 

Another major protest is planned at the Crown Property Bureau on Wednesday. Protesters say they seek to reclaim the palace fortune, which the king has taken under his personal control.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>","Mozambique police say northern village, site of reported beheadings, retaken from insurgents","MAPUTO (Reuters) - Over 1,000 Mozambique troops on Thursday recaptured the northern village of Muidumbe from Islamist insurgents, police general commander Bernardino Rafael said, killing 16 and destroying some of their logistics.
Mozambique's northernmost province of Cabo Delgado, home to gas developments worth some $60 billion, is grappling with an insurgency linked to Islamic State that has gathered pace this year, with insurgents regularly taking on the army and seizing entire towns.
Speaking to troops in a field in Muidumbe, an area where local media reported a spate of beheadings by insurgents last week, Rafael congratulated the men for their victory but warned they had not won yet.
""We marched and arrived in Muidumbe district headquarters, we expelled those who had occupied it,"" he said in footage broadcast by state broadcaster TVM following the operation.
""Congratulations to our brave men... (but) what we achieved up to now is not a victory, we achieved one step of our work,"" he said, adding that insurgents should stop the violence and speak with the government, which is open to dialogue.
The insurgent group, Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama, staged their first attack in 2017. Known at first mainly for crude beheadings, they declared allegiance to Islamic State in June 2019 and since then have massively stepped up their attacks in both scale and frequency.
In August, they captured the key town of Mocimboa da Praia, only around 60 kilometres from the gas developments. The government has yet to announce its recapture.
Security analysts, who can be sceptical of government claims of victory, said an offensive had taken place in Muidumbe.
Jasmine Opperman, analyst at the Armed Conflict Location and Data Project, said some nearby villages at least had been recaptured, though many locals were still hiding in the bush.
She added this had more symbolic importance for the government than strategic: ""The government could not allow a second Mocimboa da Praia.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - The cabinet-level head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, will visit Taiwan, the island's premier said on Friday, in what will be the third visit by a senior U.S. official since August, drawing anger from Beijing.
China, which claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, reacted with fury when the U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar came to Taipei in August, followed by U.S. Undersecretary of State Keith Krach in September, sending fighter jets near the island each time.
The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan, including with new arms sales, alarming China.
Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters Taiwan-U.S. interactions had been increasing.
""At the invitation of Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will come to Taiwan, to have bilateral discussions on international cooperation on environmental protection issues,"" Su said. 
The trip will ""be further beneficial to the relationship between the two countries"", Su added.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said Wu had extended the invite to Wheeler last year, and that it would announce details at an ""appropriate time"".
In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman said China opposed any official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan, and urged Washington to fully recognise the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue.
""China will make a legitimate and necessary response in accordance with how the situation develops,"" Zhao Lijian told a daily news briefing, without elaborating.
The EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York Times reported that Wheeler's three-day trip was scheduled for the week of Dec. 5. 
The paper quoted James Hewitt, a spokesman for Wheeler, as saying the agency was still working through logistics but that Wheeler was invited to Taiwan ""to collaborate on issues including the Save our Seas initiative and marine litter, air quality, and children's health"".
Former President Barack Obama's then-EPA chief Gina McCarthy visited Taiwan in 2014.
While Trump, a Republican, is a popular figure in Taiwan, the government has moved to allay concerns the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, will not be as supportive.

Taiwanese officials have pointed out that support for Taiwan is bipartisan in the United States, and last week Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Washington spoke by telephone with Antony Blinken, a longtime confidant of Biden's.

PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - The German defence minister's warning against the ""illusions"" of pursuing European defence autonomy rattled French President Emmanuel Macron so much that her comments became a topic of discussion at a cabinet meeting this month in Paris.
""We found it regrettable, but we noted it was only an isolated position and not (Chancellor Angela) Merkel's line,"" an official present in the room at the Elysee palace told Reuters, putting a brave face on the divergence of views.
In a robustly Atlanticist column published by Politico on Nov. 2, on the eve of the U.S. presidential election, Germany's Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said Europe would remain dependent on Washington for its defence for a long time to come. 
Macron, a champion of European ""strategic autonomy"", said he was ""in complete disagreement"" with the German minister, arguing that the United States would only respect a Europe that was more self-reliant in defence.
The episode is illustrative of how some deep-seated differences between the European Union's two most powerful nations are bubbling to the surface now that the days of U.S. President Donald Trump's isolationist policies which helped Macron promote his agenda are numbered.
Although Joe Biden's election victory may well mean warmer, stabler transatlantic relations, people close to Macron say Trump's ""America First' approach and public bullying of Germany for not spending more on defence had helped the French leader press his vision of European strategic autonomy.
""He helped us, that's for sure,"" one said, ""in words and in deeds."" 
The four years of hostility from Trump pushed the EU machine more in Macron's direction and accelerated efforts to deepen EU defence cooperation. The EU will soon draw up a master military strategy document, the closest thing it could have to a military doctrine, diplomats said on Thursday.
DIFFERENCES EXPOSED
But that impetus may weaken with Biden, an avowed Atlanticist returned to the White House. Germany has long believed Europe's security interests are best served in a close defence alliance with the United States.
""With the Biden victory, some hidden German-French differences come into the open again,"" said one German government official. ""It was easy to reject Trump, but the view of Washington will change with Biden."" 
Macron and Merkel have spoken regularly to each other, both before and since Biden's election win, about the future of the transatlantic relationship, conversations which prompted Macron to say Merkel was more in line with Paris, French officials say.
German officials insist Merkel - who is due to step down next year - supports her defence minister but also say that the gap between Paris and Berlin is narrower than it might appear. It was understandable that there was ""nervousness"" in Paris after Biden's victory, but it was unfounded, they said.
""The differences on defence are not that big,"" a source close to Merkel said. ""Think of all the joint military cooperation projects.""
French officials say it would be misguided to believe a Biden win heralds a return to the ""good old days"" of the transatlantic relationship. 
A ""pivot to Asia"" undertaken by Barack Obama, Biden's former boss, is likely to resume with the Democrats back in power.
Merkel has said Europe must do more to ensure its own security, including with increased NATO contributions, and has cautioned against euphoria over an impending Biden presidency.
""Merkel is the last person who thinks that with Biden everything will be fine again in transatlantic relations,"" the source close to her said.
So if both countries want to strengthen European defence and at the same time work with Washington, some analysts ask what motivated Kramp-Karrenbauer to speak out so strongly.

""It's possible that some particularly Atlanticist voices in Berlin suspect Macron of secretly wanting to weaken NATO,"" Ulrike Franke of the ECFR think-tank wrote in Le Grand Continent.

The FSB said in a statement that a court in Bryansk, southwest of Moscow, had found Yuri Eschenko guilty of state treason on Nov. 17 and sentenced him to 13 years in a high-security facility.
Eschenko pleaded guilty and said he regretted what he had done, the FSB said. Reuters could not immediately reach a lawyer for him. 
Eschenko, working in the town of Severomorsk, had a job servicing radio-electronic systems used by the Northern Fleet's ships.
The FSB said he had copied secret documents related to weapons systems used by the Northern Fleet. He had done the copying from 2015 to 2017 with a view to selling the information on to a third party, it said. 
In 2019, the FSB said he had made contact with the CIA. He was arrested in July by the FSB in the Bryansk region trying to hand over the state secrets, it said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - China's foreign minister will visit Seoul next week for meetings with officials there, South Korea's foreign ministry said on Friday, amid efforts to resume bilateral summit diplomacy and stalled nuclear talks involving North Korea.
Wang Yi will arrive in South Korea on Wednesday for a three-day stay and meet his counterpart Kang Kyung-wha for a high-level bilateral exchange and to discuss regional issues including North Korea and the COVID-19 outbreak, the ministry said in a statement. 
Wang's trip would come as the two countries explore a potential visit to Seoul by Chinese President Xi Jinping, which had been expected early this year but was postponed as the pandemic wiped clean much of the global diplomatic calendar. 
The Chinese foreign minister is the second senior diplomat to travel to South Korea since the coronavirus emerged in China late last year, after Yang Jiechi, a member of the Communist Party Politburo, visited the southern port city of Busan in August.

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Djeneba Sawadogo was making a cake when she heard a noise she did not recognise - a series of sharp cracks that rang across the village of Tongomayel in northern Burkina Faso in June 2019. 
A dozen gunmen had opened fire, killing her friends and neighbours and forcing the survivors to flee south. In the rush, Sawadogo left behind her identity card, which would have allowed her to vote in Sunday's legislative and presidential elections. 
""My papers are at home. There is no one there to get them,"" said the 20-year-old as she comforted her crying baby daughter. 
Eighteen months on, she is stranded on a vast moonscape at the edge of the capital Ouagadougou, where thousands of displaced people scrape by without electricity or water, and children crack rocks to turn into gravel to sell to construction workers for a pittance. 
She and thousands of others there will have no say over who will run the former French colony for the next five years.
Once a pocket of calm in a turbulent region, landlocked Burkina Faso has been sucked into a security crisis that has overwhelmed much of West Africa in recent years. 
Islamist insurgents with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have killed over 2,000 people this year, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a consultancy that tracks political violence. That is up from around 300 killed in 2018. 
Ethnic and religious tensions have increased, pulling at the seams of once-peaceful communities. Over one million people - one in 20 - have been displaced.
At least 400,000 people, or nearly 7% of the electorate, will be unable to cast their votes on Sunday, official data show, because they cannot access voting locations. Polling stations will not open in hundreds of villages because of the threat of violence. In addition, an unknown number of people like Sawadogo who do not have identity documents will also have no vote.
President Roch Marc Kabore is seeking a second term but analysts say it will be tight. He promised development and prosperity, but violence reigns.
In the capital, where jihadists have carried out attacks in recent years, the army presence has increased in the lead-up to the vote. Armed soldiers patrol busy intersections on foot. 
""I cannot vote for the president,"" said Tapsoba Ali, 33. ""It is under his regime that there have been all these problems. We want someone who can lead better.""
STRUGGLE TO VOTE
In a crowded field of 13 candidates, two opponents stand out: former Finance Minister Zephirin Diabre, who came runner-up in 2015 and who has a lot of young support; and Eddie Komboigo who runs the party of ousted former President Blaise Campaore and enjoys the large funding network that brings.
Both have sought to exploit the security situation, which could hurt the president. Much of his votes come from the countryside where so many have fled. 
""Traditionally, cities are not favourable to the standing president. The current situation could reduce Kabore's chances of winning,"" said Siaka Coulibaly from the Center for Public Policy Monitoring by Citizens in Ouagadougou. 
On the dusty plain outside Ouagadougou, a rare few did make sure their vote would count. 
Yompoco Ilboudo, 73, fled her home in the northern Soum province last year when gunmen raided her village, killing many of her cousins. She walked for five days to find safety in the nearest city. 
She took her birth certificate with her when she left, which allowed her to register. On Sunday she plans to take the short walk to a polling station on the edge of town. 

""It is important for us to vote,"" she said. ""I want this country to sort itself out.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government put convicted rapist and murderer Orlando Hall to death by lethal injection on Thursday, the eighth execution under the Trump administration since capital punishment was reinstated at the federal level over the summer.
Hall, 49, was pronounced dead at 11:47 p.m. EST after officials at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons administered him a fatal dose of the barbiturate pentobarbital at the bureau's execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana, the agency said.
Hall was the second African-American man to be executed by lethal injection on federal death row in recent months. 
He was convicted by an all-white jury for his role in the 1994 kidnapping, rape and murder of the 16-year-old sister of two Texas drug dealers whom Hall suspected had stolen money from him.
He and three other men kidnapped Lisa Rene from her apartment in Texas and drove her back to a motel room in Arkansas where they tied her up, raped her and beat her with a shovel before she was buried alive.
A statement from the victim's sister, Pearl Rene, issued after the execution expressing the family's relief at reaching ""the end of a very long and painful chapter in our lives.""
""The execution of Orlando Hall will never stop the suffering we continue to endure,"" she wrote. ""Please pray for our family as well as his.""
U.S. Attorney General William Barr ended a 17-year hiatus in federal executions in July, after announcing last year that the Bureau of Prisons was switching to a new single-drug method for lethal injections, from a three-drug combination it last used in 2003.
Hall was put to death shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court denied an 11th-hour petition for a stay, over-ruling a lower-court order that had briefly blocked the execution on grounds that protocols for administering sodium pentobarbital without a prescription violated the law.
Hall's lawyers also sought to stay the execution in two other cases, also rejected by the high court. 
In one, they argued his attorneys needed more time to prepare a clemency petition, but were hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In a third case, they claimed that racial discrimination played a role in securing an all-white jury to decide his fate.
According to a statistical analysis cited in that litigation, the federal death penalty in Texas between 1988 and 2010 was ""disproportionately meted-out based on race.""
The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which filed an amicus brief on Hall's behalf, argued there was evidence prosecutors in his case had improperly stricken Black individuals from the jury pool based on racial motivations.
Hall's execution came as the United States has faced a reckoning over racial injustice sparked by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man taken into custody and handcuffed, as he lay gasping for breath, his neck pinned to the ground under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis.

Of the 56 people on federal death row, 26 of them, or 46%, are Black, and 22, or 39%, are white. Black people comprise only 13% of the U.S. population.

Lee Suet Fern, 62, was given a 15-month suspension by one of the city-state's top courts for her involvement in the will of which her husband, Lee Hsien Yang, and current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong are beneficiaries.
The will has been central to a long-running public feud between the siblings due to disagreements over what to do with their late father's house: demolish it, or let the government decide whether to make it a heritage landmark.
In its ruling the court noted the final will in which Lee Suet Fern was involved was ""materially similiar"" to a previous version and said she ""did not act dishonestly"" in her dealings with Lee Kuan Yew. 
However, in reaching its judgement the court said there was a clear ""potential conflict of interest"" given the ""divided loyalties"" to her father-in-law and husband. 
Lee Suet Fern said in a statement she disagreed with the decision and said neither her father-in-law nor any of his beneficiaries had made a complaint against her.

Democratically-run Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, now has four submarines, two dating to World War Two, and no match for China's fleet, which includes vessels able to launch nuclear weapons.
The first of the submarines is expected to enter service in late 2024.
In a statement, Presidential Office spokesman Xavier Chang said the programme was a major part of President Tsai Ing-wen's military modernisation and self-sufficiency plan.
""This represents a new milestone in the national submarine manufacturing plan,"" said Chang, adding that Tsai was set to attend a ceremony next Tuesday to kick off the work.
Taiwan has come under increasing pressure from Chinese forces which have ramped up their activities near the island, on occasion flying fighter jets across the unofficial buffer median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian military personnel who spoke out against alleged war crimes in Afghanistan said on Friday they felt vindicated by an inquiry which called for possible prosecution of troops, as the country reacted with shame and anger at the findings' severity.
A report published on Thursday found Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan, with senior commandos forcing junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to ""blood"" them for combat.
The report recommended referring 19 current and former soldiers for potential prosecution, in a development that prompted anguish in Australia which usually honours its military history with fervour.
David McBride, a former military lawyer facing charges of leaking information about special forces actions in Afghanistan, felt ""buoyed"" by the report after years of being treated like a ""traitor to the diggers"", his lawyer Mark Davis told Reuters, using the Australian slang for soldiers.
""If the accusations that he's previously made are proven right, he will feel vindicated whatever the penalty,"" Davis said by telephone. ""His reputation will be intact and his sense of honour will be intact.""
McBride has confirmed giving classified documents to the Australian Broadcasting Corp, triggering charges against him and an investigation into the public broadcaster which sensationally led to a raid on its Sydney headquarters last year. [https://reut.rs/35KCobF]
Police dropped the ABC investigation last month, citing lack of public interest in proceeding, but McBride still faces a lengthy prison sentence if found guilty after a trial starting next year. His charges must now also be dropped, said his lawyer Davis.
Dusty Miller, a special forces medic who testified at the inquiry, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp that hearing the country's defence chief publicly confirm his claims was ""complete vindication"".
""DISTRESSING""
The report has been described by Australian leaders as one of the darkest military chapters for Australia, just nine days after the country's Remembrance Day for fallen soldiers when it is customary to wear a red poppy to show respect.
Top lawmakers walked a delicate line of condemning the allegations of the report and supporting the possibility of prosecutions, while expressing solidarity with the country's armed forces.
""It made me physically ill, and it was a very distressing read,"" said Defence Minister Linda Reynolds, a former army officer.
""I know that it certainly didn't represent my service ... and it certainly doesn't represent the majority of men and women who have and continue to serve our nation with such great distinction.""
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the allegations were ""very serious but they should not overshadow the immense good work that is being done the defence forces in our name"".
Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned earlier that the report would be troubling for Australia and its military but has not commented since its publication. Overnight, the office of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said on Twitter that Morrison had ""expressed his deepest sorrow"" over the allegations.
Reynolds said last week that Canberra had been advised that local prosecution would negate charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.
People in Kabul, the Afghan capital, welcomed the prospect of bringing perpetrators to justice, but were divided on the question of where.
""They who have committed such a big crime must be handed to face the law of Afghanistan and should be punished accordingly,"" said Abdul Mutahal, a resident of Kabul.
Mohammad Isaaq Faiaz, a shi'ite imam, said the alleged perperators ""should be brought to justice in Australia, and the affected families of those martyred must be paid with the ransom"".

Police told Jolovan Wham, 40, who has had several run-ins with authorities in the city-state, which tightly controls public assembly, the media and free speech, on Thursday that he would be formally charged in court Monday.
The charge relates to a March incident in which Wham demonstrated his support for a young climate activist who said he had been questioned by police over a similar protest days previous. Wham posted a picture of himself holding the sign on his social media accounts.
The civil rights campaigner, who has already served two brief stints in jail this year, will be charged under the Public Order Act, which regulates assemblies and processions in public places, according to the charge sheet Wham posted on Twitter. 
He faces a fine of up to S$5,000 ($3,719). 
Singapore police confirmed Wham had been notified of charges but did not immediately have further comment.
""These charges against me only show how absurd the situation has become,"" Wham said in a text message, adding he planned to plead not guilty. 
""Calling what I did an assembly is an abuse of the English language. How can one man standing in public for a few seconds for a photo op be a threat to public order?"" Wham said.
Amnesty International Southeast Asia researcher Rachel Chhoa-Howard said the incident was ""yet another example of targeted action"" to clamp down on Wham's ""peaceful activism"".

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his allies lost three court rulings on Thursday in their effort to stop President-elect Joe Biden from taking office, underscoring their dwindling options even as they continued to claim a viable path to victory. 
In Georgia, a judge appointed by Trump denied a request by Lin Wood, a conservative lawyer, to halt certification of Biden's victory in the state. The lawsuit alleged Georgia election officials improperly changed the process for handling absentee ballots.
""To halt the certification at literally the eleventh hour would breed confusion and disenfranchisement that I find have no basis in fact and law,"" said U.S. District Judge Steven Grimberg in Atlanta during a court hearing.
Trump's legal advisers, led by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, made unsubstantiated voter fraud claims and laid out what they said was a path to victory on Thursday during a fiery press conference in Washington.
Trump's strategy for retaining power is focused increasingly on persuading Republican legislators to intervene on his behalf in battleground states Biden won, three people familiar with the effort told Reuters.
Shortly after the press conference, a judge in Pennsylvania rejected the Trump campaign's bid to invalidate about 2,200 ballots in Bucks County, near Philadelphia, over purported defects such as missing ""secrecy envelopes.""
The judge noted that the Trump campaign had stipulated that there was ""no evidence of any fraud, misconduct, or any impropriety with respect to the challenged ballots.""
Wood and a Trump campaign spokeswoman, Thea McDonald, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In Arizona, a state court judge tossed a Republican-backed lawsuit seeking to halt Phoenix officials from certifying Biden as the winner.
The Arizona Republican Party had asked Judge John Hannah to order a new audit of ballots in Maricopa County, where the majority of Arizonans live, arguing it had been conducted in a manner that violated state law.
The judge did not explain why he was denying the request but said he would issue a lengthier decision soon. 

The Arizona Republican Party said in a statement that it had sought ""judicial clarification"" of a law relating to determining a sample for a post-election audit of ballots. The statement said the dispute should be clarified through future legislation.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Dozens of protesters sued Chicago's police chief and several officers on Thursday in federal court accusing them of brutal attacks and false arrests during social justice demonstrations this summer. 
The 205-page lawsuit that 60 protesters filed in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Illinois named Chicago Police Department (CPD) Superintendent David Brown as a defendant. It claims officers violated protesters' constitutional rights and it calls for the department to pay them unspecified monetary damages. 
""The CPD and other city agencies responded to these demonstrations with brutal, violent, and unconstitutional tactics that are clearly intended to injure, silence, and intimidate,"" the suit said. 
Demonstrations calling for racial justice and police reforms unfolded in Chicago and other U.S. cities after George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis in late May. Some of the demonstrations in Chicago this summer turned violent with rioters destroying property and looters stealing from retail stores. 
The suit claims police officers used unjustifiable tactics such as tackling, beating and using chemical agents against protesters. It also accuses police of falsely arresting protesters and trapping them in enclosed areas. 
The city's law department said it had not been served with the lawsuit.
""It is important to remember that these are allegations at this stage and not proof. We will review the complaint thoroughly, and each allegation it contains, once we have been served and respond through the courts as appropriate,"" the department's spokeswoman, Kathleen Fieweger, said in an email to Reuters.

Before the lawsuit, protesters filed more than 520 complaints against Chicago police officers for their conduct during the demonstrations. Five officers were referred to state and federal law enforcement for potential criminal prosecution while eight were reassigned or relieved of police duties, the suit noted.

Senators voted 82 to 18 to approve the measure, with seven abstentions.
Lawmakers are rushing to secure final approval before the end of the current congressional session in December. If enacted, the reform would mark a major shift in a country where drug cartel violence in recent years has claimed over 100,000 lives.
The Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that recreational marijuana should be permitted, just one year after lawmakers legalized it for medicinal use. 
Socially conservative President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has shied away from publicly backing the legalization push, but neither has he opposed it, and senior cabinet members like Interior Minister Olga Sanchez have openly called for a shift to legalization and regulation.
Lopez Obrador's left-of-center Morena party, which backed the initiative, holds a majority in both chambers of Congress with its allies.
The bill aims to ""improve living conditions"" and ""contribute to the reduction of crime linked to drug trafficking,"" according to its text.
Weed companies have expressed interest in a future Mexican legal market, including Canada's Canopy Growth (TO:WEED) and The  Green Organic Dutchman  (TO:TGOD), as well as a unit of California-based Medical Marijuana Inc (PK:MJNA).
The legislation would let users carry up to 28 grams and grow as many as four plants at home.
Sales to adults in authorized businesses would be allowed, provided the product abides by maximum levels of psychoactive ingredients.

Children would be prohibited from using the drug or any involvement in its cultivation and sales, and driving while high would be illegal.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of parked tour buses are gathering dust at a northern Hong Kong container port, having been off the road for 10 months since authorities banned non-resident arrivals into the city due to the new coronavirus.
The area has turned into a ""bus cemetery,"" said Freddy Yip, president of Hong Kong's Travel Agent Owners Association. He said the former British colony – which was the world’s leading tourist city destination last year - faces a similar fate at the end of November, when the government ends a wide-ranging wage subsidy programme that has helped about 2 million employees in all types of industries.
The programme was introduced in June and renewed in September, but the Hong Kong government has ruled out an extension beyond the end of November citing the high cost, leaving many tourism-dependent businesses on the brink of collapse, unable to find other revenue sources and unable to pay wages.
“If they cannot see any light ahead of them, they will just stop and cut their losses,” said 70-year-old Yip, who has worked in the trade for nearly 50 years. 
A spokesperson for the Hong Kong government said it would ""keep a close watch on the latest situation and respond in a timely manner,"" but gave no further details.
About 56 million people visited Hong Kong last year. The city was ranked number one for arrivals globally in 2019 by research company Euromonitor International. Visitors, most of them from mainland China, are drawn to its vibrant mix of cultures, dramatic harbour views and world-class shopping. 
The Chinese-ruled, semi-autonomous global finance hub makes about 5% of its gross domestic product, or about $18 billion, directly from tourism, not counting money spent in local shops and restaurants. Hong Kong's tourism sector directly employs about 260,000 people, according to the government.
Mainland Chinese visitors typically spend more per day than the average resident on baby formula, cosmetics and luxury goods, driven by a perception that Hong Kong has better quality standards than at home. That source of spending was cut off in early February, when Hong Kong sealed its borders to mainland China, with exemptions only for a small number of business travellers.
BUBBLE TROUBLE
Visitor arrivals have been down 96% to 99% year-on-year every month since February, according to government figures. A travel bubble with Singapore – allowing a limited number of people to move between the cities after being tested for the virus – is due to begin this week, but is not likely to halt that decline, industry executives said.
The arrangement lets travellers forgo quarantine, but is initially limited to one daily flight of only 200 passengers each way. That is a drop in the ocean for Hong Kong, which set its own record in January 2019 with 6.8 million visitors, including 5.5 million from mainland China. 
Tour guide Mimi Cheung, 46, said she was pessimistic about the travel bubble, due to the limited number of people, strict regulations and high costs – around HK$2,000 ($260) for mandatory virus tests, plus around HK$6,000 ($774) to buy a tour in either city. 
“The government should open the mainland border under safe conditions. It will bring some hope,” said Cheung, who has found temporary work as a night security guard to provide for her parents and two children.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said reopening the border with the mainland remains a priority, but Chinese officials have shown no indication they are willing to do so until virus cases fall to zero in Hong Kong. 
The city's government has been trying to spur local tourism by offering free tours for small groups, but operators say it has been little help.
Dozens of travel agencies have told staff to take unpaid leave from December, saying they can no longer afford to pay salaries or rent, according to employees interviewed by Reuters, travel associations and local media reports.
Violent anti-government street protests in the second half of last year discouraged some tourists, leaving many operators without cash buffers to weather this year's crisis. 
The city's meetings and conventions business is also likely to see a 90% revenue drop this year, equivalent to about HK$50 billion ($6.45 billion), said Stuart Bailey, chairman of the Hong Kong Exhibition & Convention Industry Association.
The sector, which employs around 80,000 people, has had to cancel most of this year's events, he said.

""People are not optimistic we will be back to 2019 levels for at least 18 months to two years.""

(Reuters) - A former  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) barista in New Jersey sued the coffee chain on Thursday, claiming she was fired illegally because she did not want to wear a ""PRIDE"" T-shirt, which she said conflicted with her religious beliefs.
Betsy Fresse said her August 2019 dismissal from a Glen Ridge, New Jersey store, near her Newark home, for allegedly violating Starbucks' ""core values"" amounted to illegal religious discrimination under federal civil rights law.
The Seattle-based chain's website says Starbucks values ""creating a culture of warmth and belonging,"" and is committed to respecting inclusion and diversity.
According to the complaint, Starbucks violated that commitment by trying to ""exclude and silence Mrs. Fresse whose religious beliefs it deemed undesirable.""
Fresse is seeking unspecified damages.
A Starbucks spokesman said Freese's claims had no merit.
""Starbucks aims to create a warm and welcoming environment for partners (employees) and customers,"" the spokesman said. ""Other than our green apron, no part of our dress code requires partners to wear any approved items that they have not personally selected.""
Fresse's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The complaint said Fresse believes ""marriage is defined in the Bible as between one man and one woman only, and that any sexual activity which takes place outside of this context is contrary to her understanding of Biblical teaching.""
Fresse said her manager told her in June 2019 she would not have to wear a PRIDE T-shirt, after she saw a box of them in his office.
She said Starbucks' ethics and compliance helpline later contacted her, and she responded that she opposed wearing the T-shirt because of her religious beliefs.
The termination notice cited Fresse having allegedly ""stated she did not want to wear a PRIDE T-shirt and that partners 'need Jesus.'""
Fresse said she did not discriminate against customers in her 3-1/2 years working at Starbucks.

PARIS (Reuters) - France wants international supervision to implement a ceasefire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict amid concerns in Paris that Russia and Turkey could strike a deal to cut out Western powers from future peace talks, the presidency said on Thursday.
Moscow co-chairs the Minsk group overseeing the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute with Washington and Paris, but they were not involved in the deal signed by Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan to end six weeks of fighting over the enclave.
Since the ceasefire, Russia has held talks with Turkey, a key Azerbaijani ally and a harsh critic of the Minsk group, that could lead to Ankara deploying troops to the region.
""The end of the fighting should now allow the resumption of good faith negotiations in order to protect the population of Nagorno-Karabakh and ensure the return of tens of thousands of people who have fled their homes in recent weeks in good security conditions,"" President Emmanuel Macron's office said after calls with the Azerbaijani president and Armenian prime minister.
France's population includes between 400,000 to 600,000 people of Armenian origin. Macron has been careful not to back a side in the conflict, but has faced criticism at home that he did not do enough to help Yerevan.
""We want the Minsk Group to play its role in defining the surveillance (of the ceasefire),"" a French presidential official told reporters.
The source said Paris was pushing for ""international supervision"" of the ceasefire to allow the return of refugees, organise the return of foreign fighters, especially from Syria, and to start talks on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Relations between France and Turkey have been particularly bad for several months. Paris has accused Ankara of fuelling the crisis in the Caucuses.
""We understand that the Russians are talking to the Turks regarding a possible formula, which we don't want, that would replicate the Astana (process) to divide their roles in this sensitive region,"" the official said.
""We can't have on one side Minsk and the other Astana. At one point the Russians have to make a choice."" 

The Astana forum enabled Russia and Turkey to discuss between them how to handle the Syrian conflict and brush aside Western powers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - ""Star Wars"" robot R2-D2 cannot deliver Thanksgiving dinner to your door, but his relatives are doing the packing.
Immune from the coronavirus, industrial robotic arms are assembling donated holiday food in a Boston suburb, allowing elderly volunteers to stay home in a pandemic that has doubled hungry households.
In Bedford, Massachusetts, the whirring arms studded with suction cups pick, sort and pack such Thanksgiving staples as potatoes and stuffing. Humans will ship them to two nonprofit groups to distribute to people in need.
""Picking with Purpose"" is a partnership between artificial intelligence firm Berkshire Grey and Greater Boston Food Bank and City Harvest in New York, which feed some of the estimated 54 million people in the United States struggling to afford food during the pandemic.
""There's like a double whammy,"" said Steve Johnson, Berkshire Grey's president and chief operating officer of robotics, citing the health risks and spike in hunger.
""A lot of the people that help in food banks are typically retirees or volunteers in that age group,"" he said. Seniors are particularly vulnerable to the air-borne coronavirus that has killed more than 250,000 in the United States.
Berkshire Grey donated 40,000 pounds of food for the Thanksgiving project. About 3,000 boxes, with four meals each, go to City Harvest in New York and 1,000 boxes to the Boston food bank, feeding 16,000 people on the Nov. 26 holiday.
Many had never needed food handouts before.
Before the pandemic, the Greater Boston Food Bank, New England's largest hunger-relief organization, was feeding about 300,000 in a city with a population of 710,000, according to WorldPopulationReview.com.
""Now these numbers are shy of 700,000 people"" in and around Boston who need help, said Carol Tienken, COO of the nonprofit group. ""This is the entire city of Boston that we're having to feed right now because people can't access food.""
In New York, 2 million people do not know where their next meal is coming from, up from 1.5 million before COVID-19 gripped the city.
""We're seeing a lot of new families, children, people that look like you and I, with the amount of people that are out of work,"" said Racine Droz, director of donor relations at City Harvest.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it will extend restrictions barring non-essential travel at land borders with Canada and Mexico through Dec. 21.
The restrictions were first put in place in March to control the spread of COVID-19. Reuters reported Wednesday they were expected to be extended for another 30 days beyond the prior Nov. 21 expiration date. Acting Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf said on Twitter the United States is ""working closely with Mexico & Canada to keep essential trade & travel open while also protecting our citizens from the virus.""
Canada's Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair confirmed the extension, saying the government's ""decisions will continue to be based on the best public health advice available to keep Canadians safe.""
Stringent measures were going into effect across the United States this week as the U.S. COVID-19 death toll passed a quarter million, the highest in the world. More than 20 states have passed sweeping restrictions this month.
Statistics Canada said last month that August visits to Canada by car by U.S. travelers were down 95.7% in August and the number of U.S. travelers to Canada by plane fell by 97.9%.
The United States still has in place entry bans on nearly all non-U.S. citizens who recently were in China, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil, Iran and countries in the so-called Schengen border-free area of Europe.
The Trump administration has held extensive talks with various countries about modifying those restrictions to allow for the resumption of some travel with COVID-19 testing before departure and after arrival.
Nearly all of Europe still bans most U.S. travelers, while the UK allows Americans to visit but requires a two-week quarantine upon arrival.

Elizabeth, 94, and Philip, 99, married in London’s Westminster Abbey on Nov. 20, 1947, just two years after the end of World War Two. 
To mark their anniversary, Buckingham Palace released a photograph of a smiling monarch and her husband looking at a card made by her great-grandchildren Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, alongside other cards and letters from well-wishers. 
The picture was taken at Windsor Castle, the queen's home west of London where the couple are staying during the lockdown.
In a nod to their early days of marriage, Elizabeth was wearing a chrysanthemum brooch, made of sapphires and diamonds, that she wore for pictures taken at Broadlands in southern England during the first part of their honeymoon. 
The couple first met when they attended the wedding of Philip’s cousin, Princess Marina of Greece, to Elizabeth’s uncle, the Duke of Kent, in 1934.
Philip gained the attention of his future wife when the then-13-year-old princess made a visit with her parents to Britain’s Royal Naval College at Dartmouth in southwest England where he was a cadet.
While royal watchers say Elizabeth and Philip have had their ups and downs like any married couple, they have avoided the travails of three of their four children whose marriages have ended in divorce, most notably their oldest son Prince Charles’s ill-fated union with his late first wife Princess Diana.

""He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,"" Elizabeth said when the couple celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - A new wave of mobile apps that help track exposure to the coronavirus is coming to U.S. states ahead of the holidays as public health officials bet that recently introduced features from Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google will significantly boost adoption and impact.
Colorado, Maryland and District of Columbia launched exposure-notification apps with the new technology in the last month, garnering over 2.3 million users combined, according to their public health departments. California, Washington and other states expect to follow in the next month, officials said.
Complementing human contact-tracers, the smartphone apps use Bluetooth signals to track when people are in close contact and anonymously alert users when a recent contact tests positive. They emerged as promising tools early in pandemic, but technical shortcomings, privacy concerns and dismissive attitudes in the United States toward safety measures undercut their benefits.
The tide may turning as cold weather and lockdown fatigue threaten a global surge in cases. 
In September, Apple and Google, dominant makers of smartphone software, launched a system called Exposure Notifications Express that allows public health authorities to launch apps without writing code, setting the stage for broader rollouts and better apps.
""This is one of the many tools in the toolbox, and we need to use them all,"" said Sarah Tuneberg, Colorado's senior advisor for coronavirus containment.
University of California campuses are piloting a prospective statewide system based on the new Express technology, starting at San Diego, where it has been used to notify contacts in more than 20 positive cases. Over 18,000 UC San Diego staff and students, more than 50% of the on-campus population, are using the system.
SPEEDY NOTIFICATIONS
Many governments in U.S. states and elsewhere spent millions of dollars and countless staff hours on development to launch apps before Express arrived. 
Apps in Germany and England each have seen about 20 million downloads since summer launches. Yet that remained short of the critical mass experts say is needed. Both countries have seen a major resurgence in virus cases over the past month.
In Singapore, where the virus is mostly contained, about half the population now uses the TraceTogether app, which is gradually being made mandatory for activities including school and travel.
The United States has lagged, with about 6 million people having tried exposure notification apps since the first one debuted in August, according to data from the 18 states and two territories that made apps available. 
By Christmas, nearly 50% of the U.S. population will have access to an exposure notification app, doubling coverage from early October, according to Reuters’ review.
Colorado's roll-out has become a textbook case for proponents of the technology. Google and Apple also recently started notifying their users about new app launches, and the nudges helped Colorado quickly get about a fifth of its residents to adopt the technology, Tuneberg said.
""We really wanted to get out there before, but the technology wasn't baked yet,"" she said. 
Colorado devised an efficient way to trigger notifications. To prevent false alerts, users enter a state-provided code to verify a positive test. It was taking days for backlogged case investigators to send the codes, which has contributed to poor follow-through in many states, with fewer than half of positive users entering their code.
So Colorado last week started automatically texting codes using phone numbers from testing records. Lag time is now hours, not days, and follow-through is up among users. The downside is that people who do not use the app get text messages from the state that they need to ignore.
Other states are reviewing Colorado's approach.

""Time is of the essence,"" said Dr. Katherine Feldman, Maryland's head of contact tracing. ""You want to identify contacts and get them to isolate as quickly as possible.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Thousands of workers and students protested in Colombia on Thursday against the social and economic policies of President Ivan Duque, despite restrictions to control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Protesters marched peacefully in the country's main cities and tried to respect requirements such as the use of face masks and maintaining social distancing. 
""This is a government that neither discusses nor negotiates, which means we need to maintain protests. The president is deaf, blind and mute in the face of other opinions,"" Diogenes Orjuela, president of the Central Union of Workers (CUT), told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
Protesters' demands include improving health coverage and education, establishing a basic income for the unemployed and those without pensions, as well as help for small businesses, the union leader said.
""As long as the government upholds its attitude of no dialogue or negotiation, protests will continue throughout the country,"" Orjuela said, announcing new marches for December and next year. 
Duque's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The interior ministry declined to comment.
In September the death of a man following his detention by police saw a wave of protests in Bogota and satellite city Soacha, in which 13 people died.
Marches last year were mostly peaceful but saw looting of shopping centers and attacks against public transport in the first few days, which lead the government to declare a curfew in Bogota and Cali.
Youth Dilan Cruz died after being struck in the head by a projectile fired by police during a protest last November, converting him into a symbol of protests than continued into the middle of December last year.

Protests on Thursday in Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga were peaceful, organizers said.

The 44-year-old Stuart, who wins 50,000 pounds ($66,000) and is only the second Scot to have won the prestigious literary prize, said he was stunned.
The book, based on his own childhood, tells of a young boy growing up during tough years in Glasgow with a mother who is battling addiction. Stuart's own mother died of alcoholism when he was 16.
""I think I've been clear that my mother is in every page of this book and without her I wouldn't be here and my work wouldn't be here,"" he said.
""My mother unfortunately suffered with addiction and didn't survive that addiction,"" he told the award ceremony, which had to be mostly held remotely because of a lockdown in England to stop the spread of COVID-19.
""And so for 30 years I've carried an awful lot of sort of loss and love and pain, and I wanted really just to tell the story of what it was like to grow up queer in Glasgow, to grow up with a parent who you love but you couldn't save."" 
Margaret Busby, the chair of judges, said the novel was gracefully and powerfully written.
""'Shuggie Bain' is destined to be a classic — a moving, immersive and nuanced portrait of a tight-knit social world, its people and its values,"" she said.
Among those who contributed to the ceremony were former U.S. President Barack Obama, who said reading had offered a brief respite from the daily challenges of the presidency.
Camilla, the wife of British heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, said this year's prize was more important than ever. 
""While COVID deprived us of so many cultural pleasures... we have, at least, been able to read,"" she said. ""As long as we can read, we can travel, we can escape, we can explore, we can laugh, we can cry and we can grapple with life's mysteries.""

The consulate will be in Laayoune, the largest city in Western Sahara, and the decision to open it came after a phone call between King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II.
Arab Gulf monarchies have expressed support for Morocco after its army intervened on Friday in a UN-monitored area to open a road that was blocked by Polisario supporters and armed fighters for three weeks.
The Jordanian monarch welcomed “the reopening of the passage to the safe movement of people and goods between the Kingdom of Morocco and Sub-Saharan Africa,” the Royal palace said in a statement.
Following the entry of the Moroccan army into the UN-monitored buffer strip, the Polisario independence front said it has quit the UN-brokered ceasefire and declared war.
Algeria, which backs the Polisario, was the only Arab state that has condemned Morocco’s actions in the Western Sahara passage.
The Polisario front, which seeks independence for the territory, announced it has quit the UN-brokered ceasefire and declared war against Morocco.
The UAE and some 16 African states have already opened consulates in the disputed territory as Rabat reaps more support for its position over the Western Sahara conflict since it joined the African Union in 2017.
Morocco has held the vast desert region since Spain quit in 1975 and regards it as an integral part of its own land.
Rabat has said the most it can offer as a political solution to the dispute is autonomy. The Polisario and its ally Algeria reject this and say they want a referendum, with independence for Western Sahara as one of the options.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday agreed to briefly stay the execution of Lisa Montgomery, the lone woman on federal death row, after her attorneys fell ill with COVID-19 and were unable to file a timely clemency petition on her behalf.
U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss said that though his order will temporarily stay the execution, now slated for Dec. 8, it will ""not enjoin any government official, including the President,"" from taking any adverse action on her request for a reprieve.
He added that if her lawyers are not able to file her clemency request by Dec. 24, then they must have other counsel appointed on her behalf.
His ruling came after a hearing earlier this week, where Moss had at times appeared skeptical on whether to grant Montgomery more time to petition for clemency.
Montgomery, now 52, was convicted in 2007 of kidnapping and strangling Bobbie Jo Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant. Montgomery then cut the baby, who survived the attack, out from the womb.
Both her lead clemency attorneys, Kelley Henry and Amy Harwell, have been too sick with COVID-19 to prepare and file her petition.
Her lawyers had said that Montgomery has long suffered from severe mental illness and was the victim of sexual assault, including gang rape.

“The district court’s ruling gives Lisa Montgomery a meaningful opportunity to prepare and present a clemency application after her attorneys recover from COVID,"" said Sandra Babcock, one of her attorneys, in a statement in response to Thursday's ruling.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked officials to carry out an inquiry to “establish the facts” in March after allegations were raised against the interior minister.
It came after Philip Rutnam, Britain’s top official in the interior ministry, resigned saying he had become the ""target of a vicious and orchestrated campaign against him"" which, he alleged, Patel was involved in.
Patel has always rejected any accusations of bullying. Although the report by the government's independent adviser on standards was concluded in the summer, it has not been published.
The BBC, citing unnamed sources, said the draft report had found Patel had broken the ministerial code which states ministers should treat officials with respect, and that there was evidence of bullying, even if it was unintentional.
The Sun newspaper said the inquiry had concluded that Patel unintentionally broke the code, but no formal complaints were made against her, while  ITV  (LON:ITV) said Johnson would not reprimand her.
""The process is ongoing and the prime minister will make any decision on the matter public once the process has concluded,"" a government spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the reports.
Johnson's government has had an uneasy relationship with senior officials, with several top civil servants leaving their posts since his election win last December. 
Nick Thomas-Symonds, home affairs spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said the revelations could not be more serious.

TEGUCIGALPA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The death toll from storm Iota is slowly rising in Central America as authorities on Thursday said they had recovered more bodies buried in landslides triggered by flooding that swept through the already waterlogged region earlier this week.
Nearly 40 people were killed across Central America and Colombia, and the toll is expected to rise as rescue workers reach isolated communities. Most of the deaths have occurred in Nicaragua and Honduras.
The strongest storm on record to hit Nicaragua, Iota struck the coast late on Monday as a Category 4 hurricane. It inundated low-lying areas still reeling from the impact two weeks ago of Eta, another major hurricane that killed dozens of people in the region.
On Thursday morning, Honduran authorities raised the death toll to 14 after confirming that eight members of two families, including four children, were killed when a landslide buried their homes in a village in a mountainous region populated by indigenous Lencas near the border with El Salvador.
In Nicaragua, where a total of 18 people have been confirmed dead, rescue efforts continue after a landslide in the north of the country killed eight people, with more missing.
While Iota largely dissipated over El Salvador on Wednesday, authorities struggled to cope with the fallout from days of heavy rain. 
Numerous villages from northern Colombia to southern Mexico saw record rainfall swell rivers and trigger mudslides. Cities like the Honduran industrial hub of San Pedro Sula were also hit hard, with the city's airport completely flooded and jetways looking more like docks, video posted on social media showed.
Some 160,000 Nicaraguans and 70,000 Hondurans have been forced to flee to shelters, where aid workers worry the chaotic conditions could lead fresh outbreaks of COVID-19. 
Experts say the destruction caused by the unprecedented 2020 hurricane season in Central America could spur more migration out of a region already coping with insecurity and an economic crisis triggered by coronavirus pandemic-related lockdowns imposed earlier this year.
""I think you're going to be seeing an increase in migration month after month after month because of the compounding nature of this,"" Giovanni Bassu, the regional representative for Central America for the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) told Reuters.

""One storm after another is a very sad metaphor for the much broader phenomenon"" driving migration out of northern Central America, he added.

GENEVA (Reuters) - G20 leaders must help close a funding gap to buy vaccines, drugs and tests to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, a letter from South Africa's president, Norway's prime minister, and the heads of the World Health Organization and European Commission said.
The letter, seen by Reuters, was sent ahead of the Group of 20's virtual summit at the weekend in Riyadh organised by Saudi Arabia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the club of rich nations and big emerging powers.
""A commitment by G20 leaders at the G20 summit in Riyadh to invest substantially in the ACT (Access to COVID-19 Tools) Accelerator's immediate funding gap of US $4.5 billion will immediately save lives, lay the groundwork for mass procurement and delivery of COVID-19 tools around the world, and provide an exit strategy out of this global economic and human crisis,"" it said.
The letter also called on G20 leaders to commit jointly to ""a proportion of future stimulus"" spending on the tools, which are particularly aimed at securing supplies for lower income countries.
The signatories were South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg, World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.
""Engaging finance ministers now to actually raise all the money that we need, not only the urgent money needed for 2020 but actually make sure that we are fully funding the total work of the ACT Accelerator is so important,"" Dag Inge Ulstein, Norway's minister of international development, told Reuters in Geneva.
""It's the next weeks that will be very, very crucial,"" he said. 
The facility set up by the WHO and the GAVI vaccine group has exceeded an interim target of raising more than $2 billion to buy and distribute COVID-19 shots for poorer countries, but said last week it still needed more.

Roughly $28 billion is needed to fund fully the procurement and distribution of vaccines, drugs and tests, which von der Leyen said last week was equivalent to “the same sum the transport sector and the global tourism sector lose in just two days of lockdown.”

Hitomi Akamatsu, 43, was found on Monday by a waterfall on a property owned by disgraced spiritual guru João Teixeira de Faria, known as ""John of God."" The self-proclaimed healer, who became a celebrity after appearing on a show hosted by Oprah Winfrey, has been convicted of raping women at his retreat. 
Police have arrested Rafael Lima da Costa, an 18-year-old who confessed to killing Akamatsu on Nov. 10 during a robbery. Police tracked him using security camera footage and found where he had burned clothes, according to detective Isabela Silva. 
It may be difficult to send her back to Japan, Silva said.
""Due to her body being in an advanced stage of putrefaction, we don't know if we will be able to embalm her,"" Silva said.
Police said Akamatsu arrived at the ranch roughly two years ago to seek treatment for radioactive exposure she said she had gotten from Japan's Fukushima blast. She had stayed on after John of God's arrest and was well-known by residents in the town of Abadiânia, some 120 kilometers (75 miles) southwest of the federal capital Brasilia.

Japan's embassy in Brazil said in a Wednesday statement that it had been informed of her death by local police on Nov. 16. Japanese diplomats said they were liaising with officials and those who needed to be alerted to her death, without giving more information.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's main rival in an election that could come as early as next year on Thursday said he would toughen the country's stance on China, including potentially boycotting some goods produced there.
The arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a U.S. arrest warrant two years ago put Canada in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war, and Ottawa continues to struggle to respond to Beijing.
""The Trudeau government has been out of step and naive on China since the moment he was elected,"" Conservative Party leader Erin O'Toole said in an interview.
As prime minister, O'Toole said he would not ""sacrifice our security interests, our values, our alliances, just for trade opportunities.""
Trudeau has come under increased pressure to embolden his approach to China, which arrested two Canadian citizens shortly after Meng was detained. China has also shut down most imports of Canadian canola.
Two months ago, the United States announced targeted bans on some goods produced in Xinjiang in an effort to combat China's use of forced labor by detained Uighur Muslims there. O'Toole said he would consider doing the same, if elected.
""I don't think Canadians would want to buy things that came from that sort of labor environment,"" he said, adding that such a policy would require being able to trace products to entities that engage in forced labor.
""Maybe flip flops and patio furniture might be OK if we can trace those to more appropriate sources,"" he said.
The Chinese embassy in Ottawa had no immediate response.
Earlier on Thursday, speaking at a virtual event taking place alongside the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation annual meeting, Trudeau said countries needed to band together to ""push back on human rights, whether it's the concerns with the behaviors in Hong Kong, or the situation of the Uighurs.""
Polls show the Conservatives are trailing but within striking distance of the Liberals were an election to be held today. 

O'Toole, who is still little known among voters, said he needs ""as much time as I can get"" to prepare for a vote, but that his party would be ready in the spring should an election be called.

The 15-member Security Council is able to impose an asset freeze or travel ban on individuals or entities. 
""This council has tools at its disposal including to prevent obstructionists from jeopardizing this rare opportunity to restore peace in Libya. I call on you to use them,"" acting U.N. Libya envoy Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) told the council.
Last month the two major sides in the country's war - the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) - agreed a ceasefire and Libyan participants in political talks last week set Dec. 24, 2021 as the date for elections.
""The council is ready to support the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum will all the tools at its disposal, including sanctions against any spoilers,"" said a Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Williams said that despite some progress in implementing the announced ceasefire, neither side had yet withdrawn from the frontlines as agreed and cargo flights were still arriving at air bases controlled by both.
Turkey backs the GNA. Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt support the LNA. Those foreign powers have been cited in earlier U.N. documents as supplying weapons in defiance of the arms embargo.
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, said on Thursday the United States, Britain, Germany and Estonia had proposed the council's Libya sanctions committee blacklist ""some of the most egregious abusers of human rights in Libya, including Mohammed al-Kani and the Kaniyat militia.""
If no countries on the 15-member committee raise any objections by tomorrow, then the targeted sanctions will be imposed, diplomats said. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hopes to appoint current U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov as the new Libya envoy to replace Ghassan Salame, who quit in March due to stress. 
But the Security Council has not yet given the green light as diplomats said some members would instead like an African to be appointed.  
""Nickolay Mladenov is the right choice for this role. We look forward to consulting with the Secretary-General and this Council on potential African candidates for the UNSMIL Coordinator position,"" Craft told the council. 

UNSMIL is the U.N. political mission in Libya.

Youths have been burning tyres and blockading streets in the capital Kampala and other towns since Wednesday to demand Wine's release. 
On Thursday soldiers fanned out across the city, some in armoured vehicles. Troops and police fired teargas, live bullets and water cannon to disperse and detain protesters. 
A total of 16 people had been killed and 65 wounded, police said, without specifying details. A further 350 were arrested in the clashes.
Police said those arrested would be charged with participating in unlawful demonstrations, inciting violence, damage to properties, looting and other offences.
Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was detained on Wednesday after authorities accused him of violating anti-coronavirus measures by holding mass rallies.
He has emerged as the strongest challenger to veteran leader Yoweri Museveni who has ruled the East African country of 42 million since 1986.
Museveni said in a statement Uganda was losing people to coronavirus and warned he would not tolerate any violations of anti-coronavirus measures during campaigns. 
""It is criminal for anybody to ignore this...Everybody must respect the rules of the Ministry of Health,"" he said.
""Those who have been attacking people in Kampala will soon lose appetite for violence...whoever did that will regret,"" Museveni added, refering to protesters who allegedly attacked supporters of the ruling party during the unrest. 
Voters are due to go to the polls on Jan. 14 to elect their next president and lawmakers. Museveni, 76, is seeking a sixth term in office.
Moments after Wine was detained while campaigning in eastern Uganda, spontaneous protests erupted in Kampala and several towns. He has amassed a large following amongst Uganda's youth, attracted by his bold criticism of the government, often in his song lyrics.

""This is a war-like situation, so the army has to deploy,"" army spokeswoman Brigadier Flavia Byekwaso said earlier on Thursday, justifying the heavy deployment of the military.

Pompeo became the first U.S. secretary of state to visit an Israeli West Bank settlement and the Golan Heights. Palestinians and Arab states said the move would help cement Israeli control over occupied territory. 
Syria called on the international community and the U.N to condemn the ""provocative"" visit, which it said violated international resolutions, a government source was quoted on state media as saying. 
""The visit is a provocative move before the end of Trump's administration and a flagrant violation of our sovereignty,"" the statement said.
Trump delighted Israel in 2019 by recognising Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
The Heights were part of Syria until 1967, when Israel captured most of the area in the Six Day War, occupying it and annexing it in 1981. That unilateral annexation was not recognized internationally, and Syria demands the return of the territory.
Syria tried to regain the Heights in the 1973 Middle East war, but was thwarted. Israel and Syria signed an armistice in 1974 and the Golan had been relatively quiet since.

PARIS (Reuters) - Two French citizens described to a court in Paris on Thursday how they used their bare hands to disarm and immobilise an Islamist gunman in an attack on a high-speed train in France in 2015.
The testimony was given in the trial of Moroccan national Ayoub el Khazzani, who is accused of attempted murder with intent to commit terrorism.
Khazzani allegedly opened fire aboard a Thalys train traveling through Northern Europe on Aug. 21, 2015.
The witnesses said that moments after the train crossed into France from Belgium on Aug. 21, 2015, Khazzani emerged from the toilet, bare-chested and armed with a Kalashnikov rifle.
In a statement to investigators and read in court, a French citizen, who wanted to remain anonyous, said that as he realised what was happening, he grabbed the attacker by the neck, pushing him into a corner so he could not use his weapon. 
""Without thinking, I jumped on him with my two hands and squeezed hard while strangling him,"" said the man, who only wanted to be identified by his first name Damien. 
Damien, who was 28 at the time, said he managed to restrain Khazzani for about 15 seconds. 
""Then he turned towards me and trained his gun on me. I think his weapon failed as I did not hear a gunshot,"" he said.
Fellow passenger Mark Moogalian, a U.S.-born Frenchman who was 51 at the time of the attack, told the court he had been intrigued to see Khazzani enter the lavatory with a suitcase and had gone to check. Moogalian and Damien were outside the restroom as Khazzani emerged.
After rushing back to his seat to tell his wife to take cover, Moogalian managed to wrest the Kalashnikov from Khazzani and ran away, shouting ""I got the gun"", before Khazzani shot him in the back with a handgun. 
Moogalian told the court that as he fell to the ground and thought he was going to die, he saw Khazzani bending over him to recuperate the Kalashnikov.
""I thought he was going to finish me off, but he did not shoot as the weapon jammed,"" he said, adding that he then saw another passenger, U.S. soldier Spencer Stone, ""fly through the air"" and jump on Khazzani.
""I was so happy that the cavalry had arrived,"" said Moogalian, who played himself in Clint Eastwood's movie about the attack, ""The 15:17 to Paris"". 
Moogalian said that to him, the real heros were Damien and Stone, who overpowered Khazzani with the help of two American childhood friends with whom he was taking a trip through Europe. 
Despite being cut in the hand, neck and head with a box-cutter by Khazzani, Stone - who was trained as a medic - staunched Moogalian's bleeding and until the train stopped.
While other passengers tied up Khazzani with neckties, Damien went to check other carriages for other attackers and warned the train manager. 
Stone's friend Sadler, who together with another American friend helped overpower the attacker, said it was very hard to subdue him, despite strangling him and landing blow after blow on him. 
""He looked very angry, he never said any word during the fight, he had a very intense stare,"" he said, adding that Khazzani kept taking weapons out, one after the other.
""Spencer's response was so fast. That's the bravest thing I have ever seen. As his close friend, my first thought was 'what is he doing'? Then I understood that we had to help him,"" he said, speaking in English through a translator.
Asked by the judge what would have happened if they had not stopped the attacker, Sadler said: ""He would have shot everyone in our train car and then would have moved to the next one"".
Prosecutors have said the attack was premeditated. Khazzani allegedly listened to audio on social media calling on Muslims to take up arms in the name of the Prophet. He faces life in jail if convicted. 
France was at the time still recovering from the trauma of attacks in Paris seven months earlier against the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. Three months later, a squad of jihadists would strike again, killing 130 people in coordinated attacks on the capital.

A federal judge on Wednesday granted a U.S. government request to drop drug charges against Cienfuegos and return him to Mexico, a move Mexico said would restore trust in the countries' severely strained security ties.
Multiple U.S. news outlets reported that Mexico had threatened the expulsion of U.S. agents over the diplomatic dispute, but Lopez Obrador rejected these accounts during his regular morning news conference on Thursday. 
""They are saying that we threatened to expel the DEA agents; we did not threaten anyone, the only thing we did was express our disagreement through diplomatic channels and they understood us very well,"" the president said.
Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard reiterated that Mexico had warned of a review of security cooperation in retaliation for not being given advance notice about the investigation and arrest, but emphasized there was no specific threat regarding expelling agents.
Both the Mexican president and the foreign minister emphasized that Mexico was committed to conducting a proper investigation of the powerful general.
""We have no doubt that the attorney general's office will carry out ... an investigation commensurate with the prestige of Mexico and the dignity of our country,"" said Ebrard.

General Cienfuegos, who was defense secretary under Mexico's then-President Enrique Peña Nieto, was arrested in October at the Los Angeles international airport and accused by U.S. prosecutors of collaborating with one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels.

The Conseil d'Etat's ruling raises questions about the credibility of President Emmanuel Macron's climate plan and affirms the binding nature of greenhouse gas reduction targets that are contained in legislation.
France, which brokered the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, has committed to reducing greenhouse gases by 40% of their 1990 levels by 2030. But the court noted that France was already missing targets and had delayed much of the reduction effort until after 2020.
""If the justifications so provided by the government were not satisfactory, the Conseil d’Etat may then consider requiring to take further steps in order to achieve the target of 40% by 2030,"" the court said in a press release.
The case was brought to the court by the commune of Grande-Synthe in northern France. The town is built on reclaimed land and local officials say it risks being inundated by rising sea levels caused by global warming.
The court will make a final ruling, which would be binding on the state, after the three-month period expires. Rulings by the Conseil d'Etat cannot be appealed.
Climate activists hailed what they called an ""historic"" ruling.
""By affirming the binding nature of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets contained in the law, the highest administrative court is putting the state face to face with its responsibilities in the climate crisis,"" Greenpeace and Oxfam said in a joint statement with two other environmental NGOs.
Between 2015 and 2018, the rate of decline in greenhouse gas emissions in France was about half as fast as it should have been for the country to be on the right trajectory to achieving its 2030 target.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia said on Thursday it was bearing down on the capital of Tigray region in a two-week-old war, and tore into the World Health Organization (WHO) head with accusations of diplomatic lobbying for the rebels.
The conflict has killed hundreds, sent 30,000 refugees into Sudan, and called into question whether Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed - Africa's youngest leader and last year's Nobel Peace Prize winner - can hold his ethnically-divided nation together.
As international alarm grew over spreading instability in the Horn of Africa, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's team appealed for an end to fighting and protection for civilians.
Abiy's government says its troops have won a string of victories and will soon reach state capital Mekelle, a highland town of about 500,000 people, where the regional ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has strong support and a battle-hardened history. 
""Our defence forces are moving forward and closing in on Mekelle,"" government spokesman Redwan Hussein told reporters. ""There are a number of towns that have fallen.""
The war has pitted the central government against one of the most heavily militarised of 10 ethnic states that make up Ethiopia. Tigrayans from the TPLF effectively ruled Ethiopia for decades as the strongest force in a multi-ethnic coalition, until Abiy took power two years ago.
The government says the TPLF has turned renegade and is holding power in Tigray illegally. The TPLF says the war is part of an unconstitutional assault on regional rights. Both sides accuse the other of atrocities and blocking humanitarian aid. 
The government-appointed head of a newly-named interim administration for Tigray, academic Mulu Nega, said new local elections were planned to restore peace to the region once TPLF leaders were ousted.
PUSH FOR MEKELLE
Ethiopian soldiers were advancing along roads from the south and northwest of Mekelle, a diplomat tracking the conflict said. The TPLF leader told Reuters that while it had lost ground in the south and federal soldiers had taken the town of Shire to the west, it still held the town of Axum, about 215 km (130 miles) north west of Mekelle, implying resistance was fierce.
In text messages, Debretsion Gebremichael also said Mekelle was bombed on Thursday, but gave no details. The TPLF's information bureau said its forces had eliminated two army divisions and a mechanised force around the town of Alamata, without offering evidence. 
""Attempting to rule the people of Tigray by force is like walking on a burning flame,"" the TPLF warned on Wednesday. 
Assertions by all sides have been impossible to verify because internet and phone connections to Tigray have been suspended and the government has restricted access. 
Tigrayans held sway in Ethiopia for more than two decades despite making up just 5% of the population, as leaders of a coalition that took power in 1991.
Abiy, whose parents are from the much larger Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups, came to power in 2018 pledging to unite Ethiopians and end an era where one ethnic group had dominated. The TPLF bucked against the change and accused Abiy's government of an ethnic vendetta against former officials.
Ethiopia's military on Thursday accused the most prominent Tigrayan abroad, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, of trying to procure arms and diplomatic backing for the TPLF. 
Ethiopian army chief Birhanu Jula called Tedros, who served as a minister in a TPLF-led Ethiopian coalition government for more than a decade before taking the helm of the global health body, ""a criminal"". Bihanu provided no evidence, and Tedros and the WHO offered no immediate response.
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
Hundreds of foreign aid workers have left Tigray, warning of a spiralling crisis in an area where hundreds of thousands of people relied on food aid even before the fighting. 
""Deeply concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, reports of targeted ethnic violence, and the risk to regional peace and security,"" tweeted Biden's foreign policy adviser Antony Blinken. 
""The TPLF and Ethiopian authorities should take urgent steps to end the conflict, enable humanitarian access, and protect civilians,"" added Blinken, who is expected to play a senior role in the incoming U.S. administration.
Ethiopia is a major U.S. ally whose powerful army supports peacekeeping missions in Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia. 
Experts on Ethiopia are sceptical that the government can dislodge the TPLF, which has a long history of guerrilla warfare from mountainous Tigray.
""Mr Abiy's declared war aim is to impose federal control on Tigray,"" Ethiopia expert Alex de Waal wrote this week. ""No observer of Ethiopia believes that is possible.""
The conflict has also embroiled Ethiopia's neighbours. 
The TPLF has fired rockets at Eritrea, while Ethiopia has removed weapons from ethnic Tigrayan soldiers in its peacekeeping contingent in Somalia.
In the capital Addis Ababa, there have been blood donations for federal soldiers, but also sadness about Ethiopians fighting each other. 

""There will be no winner. War will bring nothing but loss,"" said a woman of Tigrayan origin, who asked not to be named.

540,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 12:21PM ET</span>",Pompeo visits Israeli-occupied West Bank and Golan Heights,"By Rami Amichay and Ali Sawafta
SHAAR BINYAMIN, West Bank (Reuters) - Mike Pompeo on Thursday became the first U.S. secretary of state to visit an Israeli West Bank settlement and the Golan Heights, in a show of solidarity that led Palestinians to accuse him of helping to cement Israeli control over occupied territory.
Pompeo's trips came during the Israeli leg of what may be his last tour of the Middle East in the final months of President Donald Trump's administration.
Trump delighted Israel in 2019 by recognising Israel's claim to sovereignty over the area of the Golan Heights that it captured from Syria in a 1967 war and later annexed, in a move that was not recognised by most of the international community.
Last year, Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy to announce that the United States under Trump no longer viewed Israel's settlements in the West Bank as ""inconsistent with international law"".
These and other decisions were greeted with dismay by the Palestinians, who boycotted the Trump White House for nearly three years, accusing it of consistent pro-Israel bias. 
The Palestinians have indicated they would resume relations as normal with Washington once President-elect Joe Biden takes office, widely seen as a gesture of goodwill towards his future administration. 
However it is unclear how many of Trump’s decisions will be reversed by a Biden administration.
On Thursday morning Pompeo appeared alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said both Pompeo and Trump were long-standing friends of Israel.
Pompeo said the two leaders discussed Iran, the perceived threat of which has shifted political fault lines in the region, uniting Israel and Gulf Arab states in fear of Tehran.
He also issued guidelines for Israeli products made in settlements to be labelled ""Made in Israel"" or ""Product of Israel"" when exported to the United States, removing the distinction between goods made within Israel and those produced in occupied territory.
WEST BANK
But first Pompeo travelled the short distance from Jerusalem to the Israeli-occupied West Bank - known to most Israelis as Judea and Samaria - where more than 440,000 Jewish settlers live uneasily among three million Palestinians, mostly in fortified hilltop settlements.
He dined at Shaar Binyamin, an Israeli industrial zone just north of Jerusalem where Psagot winery - taking its name from a nearby settlement - has a blend named after him.
""Enjoyed lunch at the scenic Psagot Winery today. Unfortunately, Psagot and other businesses have been targeted by pernicious EU (European Union) labeling efforts that facilitate the boycott of Israeli companies. The U.S. stands with Israel and will not tolerate any form of delegitimization,"" Pompeo wrote on Twitter.
Under EU guidelines farm and other products made in Israeli settlements and exported to EU member countries should be clearly labeled as coming from the settlements, which the bloc considers illegal under international law.
Pompeo's visit departed from past policy that had kept top U.S. officials away from settlements, which Palestinians view as obstacles to a viable future state.
Palestinians in the area say that the Psagot winery was built in part on Palestinian land near the cities of Ramallah and Al-Bireh.
""This land has been handed down from generation to generation to its Palestinian owners,"" Musa Jwayyed, a Palestinian-American who sits on Al-Bireh's city council.
""I am a U.S. citizen, a taxpayer, educated, loyal, ok? Why do these settlers have more rights than I do?""
GOLAN HEIGHTS 
Pompeo later flew to the Golan Heights, a mountainous and strategic plateau that overlooks Israel, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
""I very much wanted to come here on this trip to tell the world that we have it right. That we, the United States has it right. That Israel has it right,"" Pompeo said from a hilltop looking into an area of the Syrian Golan that was until recently controlled by militias fighting the Syrian civil war.
""Each nation has the right to defend itself in its own sovereignty,"" he said.
Such signs of support left many Israelis backing Trump's bid for re-election.

But Palestinian negotiator Hanan Ashrawi accused Pompeo of using Trump's final weeks in office ""to set yet another illegal precedent, violate international law and perhaps to advance his own future political ambitions"".

DUBAI (Reuters) - Humanitarian agencies say a possible U.S. designation of Yemen's Houthi group as a foreign terrorist organisation would prevent lifesaving aid to the conflict-riven country, where fears of famine are rising. 
Washington sees the group, which controls northern Yemen and its most populated areas, as an extension of Iranian influence in the region. President Donald Trump's administration has been threatening to blacklist the group, sources have told Reuters, as part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Tehran. 
Over the past few weeks concern has risen among humanitarian groups that such a designation might be imminent, sources said. 
Two separate sources told Reuters around a dozen American aid workers had left the country this week. Other sources said an informal note had been sent to American aid workers last week, in anticipation of potential safety concerns in Houthi-controlled areas.
Aid agencies worry their work would be criminalised. The Houthis - also called Ansar Allah - are the de facto authority in northern Yemen and humanitarian organisations have to get their permits to carry out aid programs, as well as work with ministries and local financial systems. 
Should the U.S. government proceed, it should also issue a 'General License' that ensures humanitarian groups can still work with Houthi authorities and provide aid, said Jan Egeland, a former U.N. aid chief who now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which works in Yemen. 
""We must be able to negotiate access for our aid and protection of civilians with all sides to all conflicts,"" he said. 
The U.N. describes Yemen, already poor before almost six years of war, as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population reliant on aid. 
This year the coronavirus pandemic, economic decline, floods, escalating armed conflict and a severe aid funding shortage have again raised the possibility of famine.
""A potential designation is coming at a time of unprecedented need ... but our ability to respond is diminishing,"" said the NRC's Sultana Begum from Yemen. 

Aid workers also worry a designation - with the increased burden on banks' compliance mechanisms - would impact Yemenis' access to financial systems and remittances from abroad, as well as complicating imports and raising goods prices further.

Israel and Lebanon launched the negotiations last month with delegations from the long-time foes convening at a U.N. base to try to agree on the unresolved border that has held up hydrocarbon exploration in the potentially gas-rich area.
A Presidency statement said Aoun instructed the Lebanese team that the demarcation line should start from the land point of Ras Naqoura as defined under a 1923 agreement and extend seaward in a trajectory that a security source said extends the disputed area to some 2,300 square km from around 860 square km.
There was no immediate Israeli comment.
Last month sources said the two sides presented contrasting maps for proposed borders. They said the Lebanese proposal extended farther south than the border Lebanon had years before presented to the United Nations and that of the Israeli team pushing the boundary farther north than Israel's original position.
The talks, the culmination of three years of diplomacy by Washington, are due to resume in December.

Israel already pumps gas from huge offshore fields but Lebanon, which has yet to find commercial gas reserves in its own waters, is desperate for cash from foreign donors as it faces the worst economic crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war.

Antagonism between longtime foes Tehran and Washington has risen since 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.
A U.S. official told Reuters on Monday that Trump, with two months left in office, had asked for options on attacking Iran's main nuclear site at Natanz, but ultimately decided against taking the dramatic step.
The Islamic Republic reiterated that any attack on it by the United States would face a ""crushing"" response.
State television said on Thursday a ""heavy, multi-purpose, and long-range warship capable of carrying all types of aircrafts, drones, missiles and radar systems"" had been added to the Revolutionary Guards' fleet. 
""Iran's Shahid Rudaki warship is a mobile naval city capable of carrying ocean missions,"" state TV added. 
Guards navy commander Ali Reza Tangsiri told state TV that the warship would provide security for ""maritime transportation lines, oil tankers, commercial and fishing fleets on the high seas"". 
A statement published on the Guards' Sepah news website quoted the elite force's supreme commander Hossein Salami as saying the 150-meter-long warship ""creates wider horizons for our navy to move across the seas"".
The U.S. Navy’s Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet declined to comment about Iran's reported move when contacted by Reuters.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>","Turkey's behaviour ""widening its separation"" from EU, Borrell says","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Turkey's rhetoric on Cyprus is aggravating tensions with the European Union and Ankara must understand that its behaviour is ""widening its separation"" from the 27-nation bloc, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Thursday.
""We consider the recent actions and statements by Turkey related to Cyprus contrary to the United Nations resolutions and further igniting tensions,"" Borrell told a news conference after a meeting of EU foreign ministers.
""We consider that it is important that Turkey understands that its behaviour is widening its separation from the EU ... In order to return to a positive agenda, as we wish, will require a fundamental change of attitude on the Turkish side.""
He was referring to comments by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who called for an equal ""two-state"" solution in Cyprus during a visit earlier this week to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north of the island.
Erdogan also said Turkey and Northern Cyprus would no longer tolerate what he called ""diplomacy games"" in an international dispute over rights to offshore resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Turkey is an official candidate for EU membership.
Cyprus has been split along ethnic lines since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Only Ankara recognises Northern Cyprus as an independent state and it has no diplomatic relations with the government of Cyprus, which is a member of the EU.
Cyprus called Erdogan's visit ""provocative and illegal"".
The EU has threatened to impose sanctions on Turkey over illegal exploration at sea when its leaders meet next month.
""Time is running, and we are approaching a watershed moment in our relationship with Turkey,"" Borrell said.
The EU has failed to persuade Ankara to stop exploring in waters disputed by Greece and Cyprus, but it has so far held off imposing sanctions that Athens and Nicosia are seeking. 

Germany, which has led diplomatic talks with Ankara, wants to give dialogue a chance because of close EU-Turkey trade ties.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>","EU to impose more Belarus sanctions, including on firms","By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers agreed on Thursday to push ahead with a new round of sanctions on Belarus including on Belarusian companies, in response to state repression of pro-democracy protests, the EU's top diplomat said on Thursday.
The EU has already imposed travel bans and asset freezes on almost 50 Belarusian officials in protest over an Aug. 9 presidential election the West says was rigged and over President Alexander Lukashenko's violent crackdown on opponents.
The new sanctions are expected to target more senior officials and also entities that finance Lukashenko and his government, Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, told a news conference.
""One day, we will exhaust the number of people that could be sanctioned. And now we have to go to more sensitive issues, which is sanctioning firms, which will affect the developing of the normal economic activity,"" Borrell said.
Borrell said it was up to EU governments to propose companies to target and did not give any examples. 
The country's largest telecoms company, state-owned Beltelecom, is accused of cutting off internet and mobile data services to hamper protesters' ability to coordinate, diplomats and human rights group say. 
The EU, the largest donor of financial assistance to Belarus, sanctioned 40 Belarus officials on Oct. 2 and has since expanded the number targeted.
The EU has sought to promote democracy and develop a market economy in Belarus, but, along with the United States, accuses Lukashenko of staying in power by holding fraudulent elections, jailing opponents and muzzling the media. 
Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled to Lithuania after the election she says she won, urged EU leaders this week to impose ""targeted financial sanctions against people ... who are in the pockets of Lukashenko"".
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said before the EU meeting that more EU measures, such as sanctions, were necessary because ""the Belarusian authorities are obviously not prepared to start a dialogue with the opposition"".
Police in Minsk used tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse tens of thousands of demonstrators last Sunday, on the 14th straight weekend of protests since the disputed election that Lukashenko says he won by a landslide.
Borrell said the EU was reviewing all its financial assistance to Belarus and none of its aid would be channelled through the government of Lukashenko, who Brussels no longer recognises as the legitimate president.
EU governments are looking for ways to increase pressure on the Belarusian leadership, which has the backing of Russia, to end its crackdown and talk with the opposition.

The death last week of a 31-year-old protester, after what demonstrators said was a severe beating by security forces, has further galvanised EU support for the Belarusian opposition.

NUREMBERG, Germany (Reuters) - Seventy-five years on from the Nuremberg Trials, the last surviving prosecutor of the Nazi war criminals behind some of history's worst crimes is 100-years-old and still spreading a message to younger generations about the scourge of conflict and repression.
Benjamin Ferencz was 25 and a U.S. soldier when, in the last days of World War Two, he was assigned to collect evidence about the war crimes committed by Germany under Adolf Hitler.
Later, Ferencz became a prosecutor at the U.S. military tribunal in Nuremberg, southern Germany, securing the convictions of 22 members of the Einsatzgruppen - paramilitary death squads who slaughtered upwards of a million people, most of them Jews, across occupied Europe.
""There are very few people who have seen what I have seen,"" he said from his home in Delray Beach, Florida.
""My job was to get into the concentration camps as they were being liberated, with the dead bodies all over the floor and with people waiting to be burned because the crematorium was so overcrowded.""
The trials are today seen as the forerunners of tribunals like the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, which has prosecuted politicians and soldiers for their crimes against humanity, albeit with mixed results.
Ferencz campaigned for decades for the ICC to be established, delivering a closing prosecution statement at the conclusion of its historic first case, against the Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga, in 2012.
""Take your case to a fair court and have them decide what's right and what's wrong,"" he said on Wednesday. ""Now you save yourself killing a lot of innocent people.""
The courtroom in Nuremberg has been preserved and still draws many visitors to see the seat where defendants like Air Marshal Hermann Goering heard their death sentences.
""There is huge interest,"" Axel Fischer, curator of the museum, said.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spain's Catalonia region will allow bars, restaurants, gyms and cinemas to reopen from Monday, gradually easing some of the restrictions put in place to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, although a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. remains.
Gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed from Dec. 21, enabling larger groups to celebrate Christmas and New Year together, the regional government said. At present only gatherings of up to six are allowed.
The curfew may also be eased somewhat during the Christmas holiday period. 
Catalonia is the worst-hit Spanish region after Madrid, with close to 300,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and over 7,400 deaths, accounting for one fifth of the national COVID-19 death toll.
""We are on the right path but there's still a long way ahead,"" acting regional leader Pere Aragones told a news conference. 
Catalonia - home to Barcelona - has imposed some of Spain's harshest COVID-19 restrictions. It was the first region to fully close bars and restaurants mid-October, much to the dismay of business owners. 
Bars and restaurants will be able to open their outdoor seating but with 2-metre spacing between tables and no more than four people seated together, unless they are from the same family. Indoors they will only be allowed to run at 30% capacity. They will have to close at 9.30 p.m.
Theatres, cinemas and musical halls will be allowed a 50% occupancy, the same for outdoor sports facilities, while for indoor gyms it will be capped at 30%.

Those restrictions will be gradually eased or tightened as the health situation evolves.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 09:21AM ET</span>",Big Tobacco gets a pandemic pick-me-up,"By Martinne Geller and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Danielle Eddy, a smoker for 20 years, quit at the start of 2019. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the 42-year-old spirits industry consultant lit up again.
""When I get on a call, I walk with the phone, and I smoke cigarettes. That's what I do,"" she said in a phone interview from Columbus, Ohio.
She's not the only one. Thousands of miles away in Brussels, photographer Olivier Truyman says that pre-COVID, he was smoking less than three-quarters of a pack a day. Nowadays, he says, he paces in his apartment ""like a panther in a cage."" And he's lighting up more than a pack a day.
In homes across the world, people like Eddy and Truyman are giving Big Tobacco a boost during the pandemic, despite public health advice that smoking increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19. A combination of anxiety, boredom, stress, and the unexpected freedoms of social isolation are among reasons they give.
In recent weeks, tobacco companies Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM),  Japan Tobacco  (OTC:JAPAF) Inc (JT), Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) Plc and  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc all raised their sales or profit targets, saying the industry had done better than expected, mostly in the United States and Europe. Imperial said staying home in the pandemic gave people more chances to smoke and more cash to spend. 
Overall, tobacco sales, which have been declining for years, are still falling, many people are still trying to quit, and the picture is mixed globally. For example in Britain, a study published in October by researchers at University College London found that attempts by smokers to quit jumped in April. Sales have been hit in countries such as South Africa, where tobacco sales were banned for five months from late March as part of the response to COVID-19. 
But in some COVID lockdowns, the decline slowed down.
For example, in the United States tobacco sales by volume fell 2% in the eight months to Oct. 24, according to Nielsen data. That's smaller than an average drop of just over 3% in the previous two years. 
Slowing U.S. sales of e-cigarettes also have benefitted conventional smokes. E-cigs rose only 2% over the period versus about 70% on average in the previous two years. By February this year, nearly 3,000 people in the United States had been hospitalized or died with what's known as E-cigarette or Vaping use-associated Lung Injury (EVALI), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
A U.S. government ban on most flavours of pre-filled nicotine cartridges used in e-cigarettes has made them less attractive tobacco substitutes for some people, according to Investec analyst Alicia Forry. But that's not the only reason she said tobacco volumes have picked up in the United States - cheaper gasoline is another, for instance. 
It's people thinking ""'my bill isn't usually this low, let's throw in an extra three packs of cigarettes, I know I'll get around to smoking them at some point,'"" Forry said.
 British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) Plc told Reuters its U.S. cigarette performance had been helped by government stimulus payments, which have boosted disposable incomes, as well as working from home and ""pantry-loading"" - stocking up on necessities.
Other factors tobacco firms cited include: reduced international travel, which has helped domestic sales in some countries, and tighter border controls, which reduced cigarette smuggling. Philip Morris said it saw demand pick up more as lockdowns eased and people smoked socially.
Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc, which owns convenience stores in North America and Europe, said in September it had seen strong demand for cigarettes and other tobacco products between April and July, with many smokers buying multipacks and cartons.
MORE PRESSING PROBLEMS
Truyman, the photographer in Brussels, works freelance for corporate clients and said his work dried up with lockdown. A general sense of anxiety around the world influences his cigarette consumption, says the 33-year-old.
He knows smoking impairs lung function, which the World Health Organization says makes it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses. And smokers who catch COVID are more likely to develop severe illness than non-smokers, according to the CDC.
While tobacco smoke contains at least 4,000 chemicals of which 70 are known carcinogens, Truyman says any health problems that may come from smoking a few more Camels a day aren't top of mind right now. ""I have more pressing things to deal with.""
From the United States and Britain to Israel and South Africa, studies have shown the coronavirus pandemic has brought with it increased feelings of depression and anxiety and in some cases, more substance abuse and smoking.
In a May survey of pandemic-related stress among more than 900 smokers in the Netherlands, 19% of respondents said they smoked more, and 14% said they were smoking less. A survey of more than 5,000 smokers from April to May in Brazil found more than a third said they smoked more during the pandemic. 
Tobacco has long been a central coping mechanism for people with mental illness or in stressful situations like war or prison. 
""Many people with mental illness, ranging from mild depression to alcohol dependence, to serious illnesses such as schizophrenia, smoke more when they're stressed, and smoke more when they're getting more sick,"" says Laura Hirshbein, a psychiatrist and psychiatry professor at the University of Michigan. 
ESSENTIAL ITEMS
The industry has lobbied to try to keep output going during the pandemic. 
For instance in Russia, which according to the WHO has one of the largest adult smoking populations in Europe, the manufacture of tobacco products was temporarily suspended on March 30 after the government omitted cigarettes from a list of essential items. 
The JT Group said Russia's Council for the Development of the Tobacco Industry, an industry association, had written to the government to try to prevent ""negative consequences"" of the suspension. Eduard Vorontsov, head of the group, told Reuters a lengthy suspension risked disrupting supplies of legally produced tobacco. 
A representative of Deputy Prime Minister Victoria Abramchenko confirmed that she had recommended regional authorities add tobacco to their lists of essential items in early April.
In countries including France, Italy and Spain, tobacconists were deemed ""essential"" and stayed open in lockdown. In the United States and Britain, tobacco was on sale in stores that sell other necessities such as groceries. 
And in the United States, people can also access coupons to buy cigarettes at a discount through apps on Android cell phones from firms including Altria and BAT (LON:BATS) - a promotional effort first reported by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which last month called on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google to prohibit such apps.
Asked about the coupons, Altria said its ""responsible marketing practices"" are consistent with previous years; BAT also said digital coupons were established before the pandemic. Google, which runs the Google Play store on Android phones, says it does not allow apps that sell tobacco or encourage use by minors and that it has reviewed the apps, which are rated Mature, and found no evidence of policy issues. 
In the United States, the CDC says calls to the national 1-800-QUIT-NOW number jumped less sharply than they have in previous years after a regular media campaign. 
Still, the impulse to smoke more may soon burn out. Imperial, which reported full-year results this week, says it expects tobacco's decline to resume in earnest next year. And Eddy, who is single, says she hopes to quit again soon. 

""Once dating is available again, I'd like to be done,"" she said.

The 27-year old man, who arrived in Greece in March 2018, was detained after an argument on Wednesday between two groups at the camp, a police official said.
He was arrested on Thursday, accused of being a member of a terrorist group and participating in homicides. He is expected to appear before a prosecutor later in the day, according to a police statement.
Police said such arrests were rare. 
Greece, on the front line of migration into Europe, promised on Wednesday to build new reception centres for asylum seekers and cut the maximum stay in camps on its now-overcrowded islands.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain announced its biggest military spending increase since the Cold War on Thursday, pledging to end the ""era of retreat"" as it seeks a post-Brexit role in a world Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned was more perilous than for decades.
Johnson said the extra spending reflected the need to upgrade military capabilities even as the COVID-19 pandemic pummels the economy and strains public finances. He outlined plans for a new space command, an artificial intelligence agency and said the navy would be restored as Europe's most powerful.
Outlining the first conclusions from a big review of foreign policy and defence, he announced an extra 16.5 billion pounds ($22 billion) for the military over the next four years. The defence budget is now just under 42 billion pounds a year.
""The era of cutting our defence budget must end, and it ends now,"" Johnson told parliament by video link from his Downing Street office, where he is isolating after contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. 
""I have done this in the teeth of the pandemic, amid every other demand on our resources, because the defence of the realm and the safety of the British people must come first.""
NEW GLOBAL ROLE
Britain was the main battlefield ally of the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan and, alongside France, the principal military power in the European Union. But its 2016 vote to leave the EU has made its global role uncertain at a time when China is rising and President Donald Trump has cast doubt on U.S. support for traditional allies.
The military spending announcement comes just a week after Johnson promised U.S. President-elect Joe Biden that Britain was determined to remain a valuable military ally.
Christopher Miller, acting U.S. defense secretary in Trump's outgoing administration, welcomed the extra spending.
""The UK is our most stalwart and capable ally, and this increase in spending is indicative of their commitment to NATO and our shared security,"" he said. ""With this increase, the UK military will continue to be one of the finest fighting forces in the world.""
The government said the increase will cement Britain's position as the largest defence spender in Europe and second-largest in NATO.
A national cyberforce will be established alongside the new space command, which will be capable of launching its first rocket by 2022. These and other new projects will create up to 10,000 jobs, the government said.
Britain's main opposition Labour Party said the increase was long overdue after the ruling Conservative government cut the size of the armed forces by a quarter in the last decade.
The extra funding will raise further concerns about how the government manages its defence and security budget after repeated accusations it allowed costs to spiral for overly-ambitious projects. 
A report by lawmakers said on Thursday that Britain's GCHQ spying agency ignored evidence and broke its budget in choosing an expensive central London headquarters for a newly-created cyber-security centre. 
After media reports that billions of pounds could be cut from Britain's foreign aid budget, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told Sky News that higher defence spending would not come at the expense of aid.
""It doesn't mean to say we are abandoning the battlefield of international aid, we're still one of the most generous givers of international aid,"" Wallace said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Toy store owner Marie Boudier is grateful November has been unusually mild in Paris this year - she's trying to survive France's second coronavirus lockdown by selling Lego sets and colouring books through her open front door. 
From behind a trestle table, Boudier has taken to handing over her orders without letting customers in, a makeshift measure replicated up and down her street and across France amid a minefield of dos and don'ts for stores deemed non-essential. 
""It's not exactly clear to what extent we're doing it right,"" Boudier said, breaking away to show one shopper little bags of marbles. 
She said she had not found official instructions on how to operate, but had not been told off so far, and was otherwise resorting to social media sites like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to try and drive online sales for ""L'Arbre Enchante"" (The Enchanted Tree). 
Formally banned from opening to shoppers since late October, stores on the no-go list in France, from booksellers to florists, are experimenting to avoid closing down fully following a two-month lockdown in the spring. 
The French government has so far been tolerant, and few shops have so far been fined for breaches, said Francis Palombi, the head of a federation of small retailers which is campaigning for all stores to re-open by Dec. 1 or earlier. 
But the improvised operations are symptomatic of a more unwieldy lockdown this time, as resentment against online giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) brews and retailers fear for their livelihood.
In Boudier's corner of the city just by the central Place de la Republique, on Rue du Chateau-d'Eau, one plant store, Adelaide Avril, is still handing over goods through a hatch in the doorway. 
Customers can try and compose bouquets by pointing at flowers from a distance, or pick out vases and pots on its website and come and collect them. 
Further up the road, vegetarian cafe and juice bar Yumi is open for takeouts, operating with reduced staffing as some employees remain on furlough schemes. It has converted its table space into a grocery store, lining up the boxes of butternut squashes and broccoli stems it usually kept for its kitchen.
The trickle of vegetable sales are not making up for the broader hit to revenues, said Laure Duteurtre, who normally runs the restaurant side of the business. But the cafe wants to hold on to some regulars for when it can re-open, she said. 
""It's one way for us to keep a relationship going with our customers,"" Duteurtre said. 
OFF LIMIT ITEMS
Even some shops allowed to let customers in, including a local bakery, said business was down in a neighbourhood with many offices. 
An indoor market on the street, home to fruit and fish stalls, was practically deserted on a mid-week afternoon. 
Still, an upscale kitchenware and home decor store nearby, La Tresorerie, is the envy of the vintage clothing shops, printmakers and fabric stores that are completely off limits.
An updated government list of what goods were deemed essential or not - after an unsuccessful campaign in France to keep booksellers open in early November - gave pots and pans the green light. 
Manager Denis Geffrault is now letting customers in again. Displays of bathrobes and shelving units are sealed off with tape, but shoppers can browse for porcelain baking dishes, oak chopping boards and glassware.
The carve-up of essential and non-essential goods was unfair for small stores, including for his neighbours, when many were in a position to implement effective sanitary controls, Geffrault said. But he too is trying to get by.

""We've got to pay the rent,"" Geffrault said.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Thursday sentenced Islamist leader Hafiz Saeed, founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the militant group blamed by the United States and India for the 2008 Mumbai siege, to 10 years in prison on two charges of terrorism financing, his lawyer said.
The sentences for the two charges - five years each - will run concurrently. 
Saeed is already in jail serving two sentences of five-and-a-half-years each, handed down to him in February this year, which means he will not serve any extra jail time.
""An anti-terrorism court in Lahore sentenced ten-and-a-half years imprisonment to chief of Jamaatud Dawa Hafiz Saeed, his deputy Zafar Iqbal, and spokesman Yahya Mujahid on charges of terror financing,"" Saeed's lawyer Imran Fazal Gill told Reuters.
Jammaat ud-Dawa is a charity run by Saeed.
""Since the convict has already been convicted ... by this court vide judgment dates 12.02.2020, so the punishment awarded to him in this case shall also run concurrently with punishment in said cases,"" said the court order which was seen by Reuters. 
Appeals have been filed against previous sentences, Gill said.
Saeed has been arrested and released several times over the past decade. He denies any involvement with militancy, including the 2008 Mumbai siege in which 160 people were killed, including Americans. The United States offered a reward of $10 million for information leading to the conviction of Saeed.
The conviction comes as Pakistan tries to avoid punitive blacklisting by global dirty money watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which judges a country's ability to combat illicit financing, including to militant organisations.
Pakistan has remained on the ""grey list"" since 2018. 
In FATF's last review in October, Pakistan was urged to complete an internationally agreed action plan by February 2021 and to demonstrate that terrorism financing probes resulted in effective sanctions.

Saeed's lawyer said his client was convicted under FATF pressure.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Family members of some of the 12 Hong Kong people arrested by China at sea in August said on Thursday they have received their first letters from them, but they were suspicious of the praise for how well they have been treated in prison.
The 12 were arrested as they tried to flee by boat to Taiwan, with most of them suspected of crimes related to last year's often-violent pro-democracy protests, and have since been detained in the neighboring Chinese mainland city of Shenzhen.
In a joint statement, families of seven of the detainees said their lawyers, chosen from a list provided by Chinese authorities, passed on letters similar in content, all describing good conditions in prison and urging their families and neighbors back home not to worry.
""There were many letters that directly 'responded' to the doubts of the outside world about China,"" the statement said.
""It is likely that the letters are written in accordance to some templates."" 
The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland under a ""one country, two systems"" formula agreed to by Beijing and London.
Pro-democracy protesters believe those freedoms are being eroded by Beijing, especially with a draconian national security law introduced this year clamping down on dissent.
China denies curbing rights and freedoms and says the legislation was needed to ensure law and order.
A man answering the phone at the Yantian district police office in Shenzhen said requests for comment should be directed to city authorities. Calls outside working hours to the information office of the Shenzhen municipal government were not answered.
The families have made several public appearances urging authorities in Hong Kong and China to allow them to speak to the detainees and appoint their own chosen lawyers to defend them against charges of illegal border crossing. 
The Hong Kong government has said they have to face justice on the mainland before returning to Hong Kong where they are expected to be further investigated for the suspected protest-related crimes. 
The families said the detainees advised them in their letters ""not to say too much"" to the media or to visit them in China.
Unlike in Hong Kong, where the justice system is independent and based on common law, mainland Chinese courts are loyal to the Communist Party and do not challenge the party's accusations. Conviction rates are close to 100%. 
In the statement, the families said they recognised the hand writing, but some of the content was in simplified Chinese, rather than traditional Chinese, which the detainees - like most people in Hong Kong - normally use. 
""It is doubtful that they wrote the letter out of their own free will,"" it said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha threatened on Thursday to use all laws possible against protesters, as demonstrations escalate for his removal and for reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Activists voiced concern that this could mean the resumption of prosecutions under some of the world's harshest royal insult laws.
""Prayuth has declared a battle against the people,"" said rights lawyer and protest leader Arnon Nampa. ""For civil servants who have not chosen sides, you need to decide whether to live in the past or to build a future with us.""
The protests since July have become the greatest challenge to Thailand's establishment in years and have broken a longstanding taboo by criticising the monarchy, which can carry a jail term of up to 15 years.
Prayuth's announcement came a day after thousands of protesters threw paint at the headquarters of the police in what they said was a response to the use of water cannon and teargas that hurt dozens on Tuesday, the most violent day of protests since July. Some protesters also sprayed anti-monarchy graffiti.
""The situation is not improving,"" Prayuth said in a statement. ""There is a risk of escalation to more violence. If not addressed, it could damage the country and the beloved monarchy.
""The government will intensify its actions and use all laws, all articles, to take action against protesters who broke the law.""
He did not specify whether this included Article 112 of the criminal code, which forbids insulting the monarchy. Prayuth said earlier in the year that it was not being used for the moment at the request of the king.
Police have been collecting evidence since July for possible prosecutions for violating the article but had not taken further steps, one police source said.
Outraged by the anti-monarchy graffiti at Wednesday's demonstration, some royalists called for the application of Article 112 in posts on social media.
Dozens of protesters, including many of the most prominent leaders, have been arrested on a variety of charges in recent months, though not for criticising the monarchy.
There were nearly 100 prosecutions for violations of the royal insult laws under the junta that Prayuth led after seizing power in a 2014 coup, but there have been none since 2018, according to data from rights group iLaw.
Protesters accuse Prayuth of engineering an election last year to keep stay on in power as a civilian prime minister. He says the ballot was fair.
A major protest is planned at the Crown Property Bureau on Nov. 25 over the management of the palace fortune, which the king has taken into his personal control. The fund is valued in the tens of billions of dollars.

Protesters said there would be seven more days of demonstrations after that.

SANTIAGO/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Conservationists are taking an unorthodox approach to save jaguars from dying out in Argentina's northern forests: matchmaking a captive female with a wild male.
The unusual courtship of Tania, brought up in a zoo, and Qaramta, meaning ""The One Who Cannot Be Destroyed"" in the regional Qom language, began last year around a specially constructed enclosure in the dense forests of Argentina's Impenetrable National Park.
With jaguars all but wiped out from the area, conservationists were thrilled in late 2019 to detect a young male, first by a pawprint in a muddy river bed, then using camera traps. Seeking a mate for him, they brought in Tania, who had produced cubs in a breeding programme in a neighbouring park after being donated by a local zoo. 
Over nine months, the two jaguars got acquainted through the fence of her enclosure, their affectionate nuzzling and purring assuring handlers they would not fight. Once permits had been secured and Tania was in season, Qaramta was allowed into the enclosure for a face-to-face encounter.
Tania and Qaramta spent just under a week together bathing, sleeping and playing, watched by an anxious team of researchers.
""We could not fully verify that they mated because they went deep into the forest but we could see that they had a good time together,"" Marisi Lopez, field coordinator for Rewilding Argentina, said in an interview. ""There was no aggression and seemed to be a very good chemistry between them.""
Lopez's rewilding group is a local partner of Tompkins (NYSE:TMP) Conservation, founded by the husband and wife team behind the North Face and Patagonia clothing brands which created the 320,000-acre Impenetrable National Park in 2014.
Since Qaramta's release from the enclosure, he has returned to see Tania through the fence almost nightly and will be granted renewed access once she is in season again. Meanwhile, Tania is being monitoring for signs of pregnancy.
The breeding of captive and wild big cats is thought to be a world-first, although project leaders sought advice from colleagues who had success with Iberian Lynxes in Spain. 
Rewilding Argentina has bred captive jaguars in nearby Ibera National Park, along with giant anteaters and bare-faced curassows.
'DESPERATE MOVE'
Howard Quigley, Jaguar Program director for Panthera, a global wild cat conservation organization, said the biggest hurdle of compatibility appeared to have been cleared. 
""In zoos it's not uncommon to have a female or male killed in these encounters,"" he said. ""In this case it looks like they've done their homework. Hopefully they now have a pregnant female who can be used for the next step."" 
The plan may seem unorthodox but the traditional approach of protecting what remains is no longer enough given the extent of environmental degradation, said Sebastian di Martino, Rewilding Argentina's conservation director.
""You have to go a step further and bring back what's been lost. It's a somewhat desperate move but there are really no other options. We do this or we lose the jaguar.""
In the worst case scenario, he said, Qaramta could be caught by hunters before he manages to impregnate Tania. In the best, their couplings will produce cubs, making them progenitors in the bid to repopulate one of the Americas' most iconic apex predators, and their offspring a potent symbol of the value of ambition in conservation.
The Americas' largest feline, jaguars have lost over half their historical range from the southern United States to Argentina. Remaining populations in isolated pockets are unable to find mates. 
In Argentina's northern Chaco region, home to Impenetrable National Park, just 20 are thought to still survive. 
When predators die out, Di Martino said, the populations of the herbivores they hunt surges, unbalancing ecosystems and damaging vegetation key to keeping carbon dioxide levels in check.

Predators also play an important role in weeding out sick animals, he added, slowing the spread of zoonotic diseases such as the coronavirus.

Zeman, one of the few European politicians who backed Trump before his 2016 election victory but who made no such endorsement this year, told news website www.parlamentnilisty.cz that while it was possible to demand recounts and go to court, Trump should take a different route. 
""I personally believe that it would be much more reasonable to give up, not to be embarrassing, and allow the new president to take office,"" he said.
Trump has refused to accept the victory of Democrat challenger Joe Biden, syaing the Nov. 3 election was rigged.
Zeman, 76, is a towering figure in Czech post-communist politics, having served as prime minister and won two presidential elections. 
Czech presidents do not wield the executive power like their U.S. counterparts, but Zeman has used his influence to push for closer ties with Russia and China.
Zeman has shared Trump's initial warm approach to Russia, tough stance on immigration or support for Israeli government policies.

But he never received a coveted invitation to the White House and has backed a pro-Russian stance on issues of U.S. interest, including plans to build a new nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic and the extradition of a Russian hacking suspect to the United States.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union aims to draw up a master military strategy document to define future threats, goals and ambitions in defence while focusing on six new areas of joint weapons development including tanks, officials and diplomats said.
The EU's ""Strategic Compass"", the closest thing the EU could have to a military doctrine and akin to NATO's ""Strategic Concept"" that sets out alliance goals, is the latest step in accelerating efforts to deepen EU defence cooperation.
After four years of hostility towards NATO by U.S. President Donald Trump, the EU, led by France, wants to become a stand-alone military power in the long term, strong enough to fight on its own and potentially a more useful ally to the United States.
The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, will brief EU foreign ministers by video conference on Thursday on a confidential, intelligence-based threat analysis before EU defence ministers take up the work at a virtual meeting on Friday, aiming to deliver a final document in 2022.
""We need to build a compass. This is a common way of looking at the world, of defining threats and addressing them together,"" said a senior EU official. 
The document would not be a list of threats, in part because EU governments have different views on their gravity. Russia is seen with more alarm in the Baltics than in France, where Islamic militancy is more pressing, envoys said.
However, it does signal what Borrell has cited as ""an increased momentum to strengthen our collective capacity"" since a December 2017 EU defence pact to develop more firepower independently of the United States. 
OPPORTUNITY FOR PARIS 
Britain's vote in 2016 to leave the EU, while depriving the bloc of a military power, has given Paris an opportunity to push longstanding ambitions for a bigger EU role in defence, with support from Berlin.
During Britain's membership, London resisted a major military role for the EU, fearing the creation of an EU army, which officials in Brussels say is not under discussion.
Defence ministers will also receive the bloc's first annual review on joint capabilities on Friday, which is expected to set out 100 areas for governments to develop together from 2025 over six areas, including battle tanks, maritime patrol vessels, countering drones and jamming technology. 
France, Germany, Italy and Spain hope that by developing national defences together, the EU will save money by putting an end to competing national industries that duplicate weapons.

""This is not just another report"", a second senior EU official said of the first review. ""This is the path for the EU to plan, spend and cooperate together in countering next-generation threats.""

560,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>",Peru's youth has taken down a president. Now they want more,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
LIMA (Reuters) - Grace Yarango is only 18 and she's already helped take down a president. Now she - and many other of Peru's millennials and Generation Z youth - have their eyes on bigger prizes: changes to the constitution and reforming a widely reviled Congress.
Peru's younger generation - dubbed the 'bicentennials' in reference to the 200-year anniversary of Peruvian independence next year - were at the heart of recent protests that led to the resignation of the country's interim president on Sunday.
The appointment of socially liberal lawmaker Francisco Sagasti on Tuesday - Peru's third president in just over a week - has restored some calm, but the crisis has ignited wider anger at the country's political classes and rampant corruption.
That could see Peru follow in the footsteps of Andean neighbor Chile, which in the wake of fiery street demonstrations last year is now rewriting its constitution.
""We want to fix the mistakes of past generations,"" said Yarango, who expects to vote for the first time next year, in elections scheduled for April. ""I feel part of this bicentennial generation, we want a better country.""
The protests were sparked by the abrupt removal in an impeachment trial on Nov. 9 of popular, centrist leader Martin Vizcarra by an opposition-led Congress, many of whom had been angered by Vizcarra's anti-graft measures. Young Peruvians railed against the lawmakers as corrupt, waving banners calling for constitutional change.
""There are no clean lawmakers,"" said Angelica Guerra, 20, heading to a protest in downtown Lima on Tuesday.
Peru's bicentennials could be crucial in the April election. Those between 20-34 years of age make up about 40% of those of mandatory voting age, official figures show. They have grown up in a rapidly changing Peru, which has seen years of strong economic growth on the back of mining exports and given them access to communication tools and information their parents could never have imagined.
Over half of those aged 18-24 said they took part in various anti-government protests this month, whether by marching or pot-banging in the streets, a poll by think-tank IEP showed. That compared to a third of those aged over 40.
Some 90% of Peruvians polled said they disapproved of Congress, and 65% did not identify with any political party, a potentially volatile mix as the economy battles a deep contraction after being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
'SPIRIT OF REBELLION'
Political leaders are starting to take note.
""The great citizen movement today belongs to the youth,"" Sagasti, 76, said in his inaugural address after taking office.
""We have to call on the youth of all ages because there are adults who have a young spirit of rebellion, the youthful spirit of seeking a better country, and that is what we need.""
Reuters spoke to over a dozen Peruvians, mostly in their twenties, who vowed to keep protesting until the country's leaders agreed to real change. Gathering in Lima's Plaza San Martin earlier this week, they were draped in red and white flags and bearing signs saying 'bicentennials.'
Many said they wanted to see Peru's unicameral Congress overhauled. Others wanted a new constitution to replace what they described as an illegitimate magna carta, created by former strong-man President Alberto Fujimori in 1993, before many of them were born.
Most did not fully witness the violence of Fujimori's government, but have seen one president after another become embroiled in corruption scandals.
""People are expecting not just for the presidents to change, but for the institutions to change,"" said Cesar Landa, a leading constitutional lawyer. ""This is a constitution-making moment."" 
But challenges remain. The movement as yet has no visible leaders, and anyone under 25 is too young to run for Congress themselves.
The protests also met with fierce resistance from security forces, who were widely criticized by human rights organizations for use of excessive force. There are ongoing investigations.
And none of the political parties have made targeting young voters a cornerstone of their strategy - so far. But Peru's youth has demographics on its side.

""Our generation has come together for this,"" said 20-year-old Evelyn Borja. ""This is the first time I feel a part of politics.""

GAZA (Reuters) - For Naela Abu Jibba, a mother of five who lives and works in the Gaza Strip, taking the road less travelled has become a way of life.
The first woman taxi driver in the Islamist-run Palestinian territory, the 39-year-old has become a target of sexist jibes about her abilities behind the wheel - but they pale into irrelevance beside the gratitude of her all-female clientele.
""I get lots of offensive (social media) comments, but the encouraging comments are far greater,"" she said. ""Some say this is a job for men, others say we (women) cause accidents, when the fact is, women are calmer and more careful drivers than men.""
Many of her passengers, who must book her service in advance, feel calmer too being driven by her than by men.
""When a woman exits a hair-dresser shop, going to a party dressed and wearing makeup she feels better riding with a woman,"" Abu Jibba said.
Client Abu Ateila, 28, agreed. ""We feel more comfortable,"" she told Reuters.
Abu Jibba, who has a degree in community service, started her taxi business after failing to find work. Gaza's unemployment rate stands at 49%, with hardship deepened by border restrictions that Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns, have long maintained.
So far, her off-white Kia, which she drives while wearing a headscarf and COVID-19 mask, is the only car bearing her Al-Mukhtara (Chieftain) taxi service's livery.
But she hopes to expand her business once the pandemic, which has caused Gaza residents to cut down on their travel and social activities, ends. The territory of two million people has reported more than 12,000 cases and 56 deaths.
""My dream is to have an Al-Mukhtara fleet,"" Abu Jibba said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City chef Michael Lomonaco is no stranger to adversity. 
As chef/partner at Porter House Bar and Grill and Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Yards Grill, Lomonaco has created and run some of New York City's most iconic restaurants, including the 21 Club and Windows of the World, which was located in the North Tower of the World Trade Center.
On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Lomonaco decided, by chance, to buy a pair of glasses at the optometrist on the concourse level of the building. It was a decision that saved his life.
More than 70 employees and almost 100 guests at his restaurant perished in the WTC attacks. Shortly after, Lomonaco, a host on Travel Channel and Food Network shows, co-founded the Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund.
On Nov. 6, Porter House Bar and Grill finally reopened.
Lomonaco, 65, spoke to Reuters about the importance of survival skills in 2020. 
Edited excerpts are below.
Q. What did your first job teach you?
A. I was 17, and it was my first semester at Brooklyn College. I got a job as a bank teller. I made $1.65 an hour, and I had to put on a jacket and tie every day. In the early 70s, that wasn't something a lot of people of my generation wanted to do. I was a Deadhead. I was in a garage band. 
In the bank business, you need precision, you need to express care with every transaction and not make mistakes. This is something I've carried through my whole career. 
Q. What advice do you have for those starting out right now?
A. Living in the moment means looking to the future. What we do today creates tomorrow. This is a very chef approach. We're always prepping, and part of that is the work that I have to do today to make my tomorrows better.
Q. What lessons did you learn while rebuilding your business post-9/11 that you think could be good advice for anyone navigating this world today?
A. There were many of us who really believed that New York was not finished. We would recover - and we will recover.
Wear a mask. Do the things we have to do. The sun will come out again. Business will return. We will find what the new normal is, and then we will succeed at it.
Q. What is your work-from-home setup?
A. When we went into lockdown in March, the restaurants closed. We laid off 200 people between the two restaurants. I live in Manhattan, in a two-bedroom apartment, and the second room is set up as an office. 
I've had to adapt. I added a second screen so I could look at spreadsheets on a different screen. I had to upgrade my Wi-Fi so I could do Zoom calls and cooking classes and post five-minute cooking demos on my Instagram account. 
Before, I had a bistro chair. I upgraded to a very nice office chair. I got a roto light that goes up on a tripod and that puts out a good amount without shadows. 
If I set up my laptop as a camera and the phone as another camera, I'm able to toggle between the two cameras so I have a master shot and closeups of the food. It's all these crazy things I didn't think I had to do, and now I'm doing it. 
Q. Have you developed new work habits in 2020?
A. What I do every day is what I always used to do, even in April and May when we couldn't leave the house: I would get up every morning like it's time for work. I'd make coffee, check the news, do some light exercise at home, shower, shave and dress like I have somewhere to go.
I thought it was important to try to keep things as normal as possible and be ready to tackle the day. I did online photography classes. I took time to go through my cookbook collection, and I found inspiration in watching other people cooking. Staying focused on the future helps me get through the day.
Q. Where would you like to travel when the pandemic is over?

A. I've never been but I'd like to go to Japan - for the food but also for the culture, the beauty, the aesthetics of how the Japanese view things, like their environment, the gardens, the connection to nature. These are all good things.

MECKHE, Senegal (Reuters) - Seven neighbours from a village in western Senegal boarded a fishing boat crammed with migrants just after midnight on Oct. 26. Their destination: Europe, 1000 miles away over open ocean.
Two of them are now missing, presumed dead, after the boat carrying dozens of people capsized in a collision with the Senegalese coastguard. 
One can barely walk from his injuries. Another is haunted by the memory of clinging to a piece of flotsam while others around him flailed and sank into the black ocean. 
""You see people die in front of you and you cannot do anything,"" survivor Sidi Gaye told Reuters before pausing and lowering his head.
Driven by economic hardship during the coronavirus pandemic that has forced thousands to seek a better life, around 17,000 migrants have arrived on the Canary Islands this year, an over 1,000% increase from 2019, according to Spanish Interior Ministry data. 
The surge in migrants to Spain's autonomous community off the coast of northwestern Africa alarms observers who say thousands could be dying en route without detection. 
Unlike the Mediterranean Sea route from Libya to southern Europe, the wooden fishing boats on the choppy Atlantic do not carry satellite phones, and people cannot make distress calls. 
Alarm (NASDAQ:ALRM) Phone, a hotline service for migrants stranded at sea, said reports indicate that over 400 from Senegal are known to have died since the beginning of October alone. 
""Invisible shipwrecks must occur ... due to the lack of possibilities for boats to communicate once they are far from the coast,"" said Paola Arenas from Alarm Phone. There is no cell phone reception for at least 70% of the two-week trip, she said.
Spanish security forces said they will deploy at least three boats, a plane, a helicopter and a submarine to slow the flow. However, it is unclear how the deployment will drastically cut departures from Senegal's long coastline where thousands of identical looking fishing boats trawl the waters daily - or if it will be a deterrent for those desperate to leave.
Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya is expected in Senegal on Nov. 21 to discuss the issue.
THROWN OVERBOARD
In all, 21 men departed the village of Meckhe, in north-west Senegal, together before dawn on Oct. 25. Only seven made it on the boat, which left in a hurry when it heard the coastguard was near. 
""I have always dreamed of ... working in Senegal, creating jobs,"" said Abdou Aziz, a 22-year-old shop owner from Meckhe who scraped together $700 for the boat. ""Since COVID, everything changed. Everything has become more expensive."" 
Soon after leaving, the Senegalese coastguard ordered the boat to stop, said four survivors, but the captain sped up. During an hour-long chase, the patrol boat fired tear gas at the migrants and passed in front of the boat to create waves to slow it down. 
Eventually, the coastguard rammed the fishing boat, causing it to capsize, throwing about 80 passengers into the water, the survivors said. When people cried for help, the coastguard waited for 15 minutes before it picked anyone up, they said. 
""I was in the place where the boat hit us and I was thrown into the water. I cannot swim, I didn't have any help,"" said Mohamed Diop, 30. Traumatized, and now needing crutches to walk, Diop spends his days in a windowless bedroom watching music videos with the lights off. 
In a statement on Oct. 26, the Senegalese army said a collision occurred and that it saved 39 people. It did not say how many drowned. An army spokesman declined to comment on the migrants' allegations on Wednesday but said an inquiry was underway.
Meanwhile, the group has returned to Meckhe, a collection of single-storey houses and shops on a dusty highway surrounded by parched savannah - the place they had tried to escape. Some are already planning to try again. 
""I still want to go,"" said Aziz. ""I'm not afraid of death.""

Duterte had also ""approved in principle"" an executive order so that vaccines, which had been approved overseas for emergency use, can be utilised in the Philippines, Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said.
""We agreed to pay in advance because if we don't, we might be the last among countries to get the vaccine,"" Roque told a media briefing. 
The Philippines, which has the second highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Southeast Asia, plans to procure an initial 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to ensure at least a quarter of its 108 million population gets inoculated next year.
Carlito Galvez, a former general leading the country's task-force to tackle the pandemic, said the government was in talks with several vaccine makers, including  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, over possible supply deals. 
Pfizer said on Wednesday it could secure emergency U.S. and European authorization for their COVID-19 vaccine next month after final trial results showed it had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects.
Moderna on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine showing 94.5% effectiveness.
Duterte has said previously his preference was for his country to source its COVID-19 vaccines from either China or Russia.
Philippine authorities have also been looking at bilateral and multilateral vaccine deals, including tapping the World Health Organization’s global vaccine project, known as COVAX, to bolster the country’s prospective arsenal against the pandemic.
Duterte has said the budget was there to purchase vaccines but he wanted a bigger supply in order to inoculate the entire Philippine population.

Galvez has said vaccines could start arriving between May and July next year, with the bulk likely to come by the end of 2021 or early 2022.

This will be Khan's first visit to Afghanistan since assuming office over two years ago. It is the highest profile visit by a Pakistani official to Kabul since peace talks began between the Taliban and the Afghan government in the Qatari capital of Doha.
And it comes days after the Pentagon announced it would reduce the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 by mid-January. 
Due to leave office on Jan. 20 after losing this month's presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, President Donald Trump is seeking to end the 19-year war in Afghanistan, the United States’ longest conflict.
Critics slammed Trump for timing the withdrawal to his own calendar as opposed to some kind of breakthrough in Afghanistan that would justify a major drawdown.
And outside of Afghanistan, nowhere is the risk of instability greater than in neighbouring Pakistan.
Mistrust has cloaked relations between the neighbours, due to Pakistan's covert support for the Taliban during the past two decades. And as militants later began launching attacks inside Pakistan, it accused Afghanistan of stirring trouble in its borders. 
""Focus would be on further deepening the fraternal bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Afghan peace process, and regional economic development and connectivity,"" Pakistan's foreign office said in a statement as Khan headed for Kabul.
Pakistan's role in the peace talks has been key, according to Washington, particularly given its influence over the Taliban leadership, though Pakistan says that influence has waned over the years. 
Washington's special representative for Afghan peace, Zalmay Khalilzad has a made a number of trips to Islamabad to discuss the peace process. 
Ghani had last visited Pakistan in June 2019, according to Pakistan's foreign office.
A spokesman for the Afghan presidential palace, Dawa Khan Minapal, said the main purpose of the visit would be bilateral trade and economic relations, but the fight against militancy in the region would also be at the top of the agenda.
""The focus will be mainly on the peace process but we won’t keep our hopes high,"" said a source in the Afghan presidential palace. 
Violence has remained high in Afghanistan despite the ongoing peace process.

During the past six months the Taliban have carried out 53 suicide attacks, while 1,210 civilians were among the thousands killed in violence linked to the insurgency, according to Tariq Arian, spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan, with senior commandos reportedly forcing junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to ""blood"" them for combat, a four year investigation found.
Australia said on Thursday that 19 current and former soldiers will be referred for potential criminal prosecution for allegedly killing the 39 Afghan locals.
Detailing the findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the conduct of special forces personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, Australia's General Angus John Campbell said there was credible information of 39 unlawful killings by 25 Australian Special Forces personnel in 23 separate incidents.
All of those kills were outside the ""heat of battle"", Campbell said.
""These findings allege the most serious breaches of military conduct and professional values,"" Campbell told reporters in Canberra.
""The unlawful killing, of civilians and prisoners is never acceptable.""
The report said the majority of those killed, which included prisoners, farmers and other Afghan locals, were captured when they were killed and therefore protected under international law.
Following the recommendations of the report, Campbell said 19 current and former members of Australia's military will be referred to a soon-to-be appointed special investigator to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute.
Australia's Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said last week that Canberra had been advised that local prosecution would negate charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.
'BLOODING'
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier warned the report would include ""difficult and hard news for Australians"", but few expected some of the most shocking revelations.
While the report was heavily redacted, it included allegations that senior special forces personnel ordered the killing of unarmed Afghans.
""There is credible information that junior soldiers were required by their patrol commanders to shoot a prisoner, in order to achieve the soldier’s first kill, in a practice that was known as ‘blooding’,"" the report read.
Once a person had been killed, those allegedly responsible would stage a fight scene with foreign weapons or equipment to justify their action, the report concluded.
The actions did not immediately come to light due to what the report concluded was a culture of secrecy and compartmentalisation in which information was kept and controlled within patrols. 
The veil of secrecy was a key reason that the allegations took so long to come to light.
Although it has been the subject of rumour, Australia's official investigation only began after the publication of classified documents about alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.
A former military lawyer, David McBride, has been charged with providing the classified papers to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. He admits that he supplied the papers, but says it is in the national interest.
The four-year inquiry was conducted by New South Wales state Judge Paul Brereton, who was appointed by the Inspector-General of Defence in 2016 to investigate rumours of war crimes in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2016. 
The inquiry examined more than 20,000 documents and 25,000 images, and interviewed 423 witnesses under oath.
The report recommended Canberra should compensate victims' families even without a successful prosecution.
Campbell said he would seek to revoke citations for special operations task groups that served in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2013.
The release of the report came after Morrison spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
""The Prime Minister of Australia expressed his deepest sorrow over the misconduct by some Australian troops in Afghanistan,"" Ghani's office wrote on Twitter.
Australia has had troops in Afghanistan since 2002 as part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Taliban militia.

Australia has about 1,500 troops remaining in Afghanistan.

Wearing black graduation robes and Guy Fawkes masks, the students marched through the campus of Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). They said they were organising their own graduation after the university said it would be held online because of the risk of the novel coronavirus.
""I want to pass on the spirit ... so the next generation of students don't forget what happened last year,"" said Philip, a social sciences graduate who declined to give his last name.
In November last year, campuses of CUHK and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) saw prolonged clashes between students and riot police, with protesters firing petrol bombs from catapults and using bows and arrows and police responding with water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets.
The PolyU campus was surrounded by police for more than a week, with some students staging dramatic escapes through sewers rather than hand themselves in to police.
On Thursday, the students held black balloons and a banner reading ""Happy graduation, CU rioters"". They chanted pro-democracy slogans and brandished the three-finger ""Hunger Games"" salute, in a nod to the gesture of defiance adopted by anti-government protests in Thailand.
Some of the graduates reconstructed a battle scene, posing for pictures as they waved flags and showed how they had used umbrellas as shields.
Protests in Hong Kong snowballed in June 2019 after years of resentment over what many residents see as meddling by the Chinese government in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The novel coronavirus, and a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing this year in response to the protests, have largely stifled the demonstrations.

Hong Kong's Journalist Association had launched a judicial review in 2019 following widespread anti-government protests, arguing that the government had an obligation to set up a mechanism capable of ""effective investigation"" into suspected ill treatment by the police.
An independent enquiry into police handling of the protests in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city became a main demand of the protesters last year, along with universal suffrage.
The former British colony's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, has said the existing mechanism was sufficient to deal with complaints and there was no need to set up an independent system. 
The court disagreed and stated that the government was under a ""duty pursuant"" to Article 3 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, to establish and maintain an independent mechanism.
""The existing complaints mechanism involving the complaints against the police office, with oversight by the Independent Police Complaints Council, is inadequate to discharge this obligation,"" the court said in its judgement.
Hong Kong's Bill of Rights was introduced in 1991 as the then British-ruled city was preparing for its 1997 handover to China under a ""one country, two systems"" formula aimed at guaranteeing it a high degree of autonomy.
The court ruling comes amid fears in the city over the erosion of its judicial independence by Beijing.
A senior Chinese official said on Tuesday that authorities were working on reforms related to Hong Kong's mini-constitution, including its judicial system.
The independence of Hong Kong's judiciary is seen as crucial to its role as an international financial hub and an interface between mainland China's closed capital system and the rest of the world.

The court also ruled that police officers not prominently displaying their identification numbers also violated the Bill of Rights.

LISBON (Reuters) - Many European countries avoid breaking down data along racial or ethnic lines out of concern over privacy or discrimination, but COVID-19's outsized impact on Black and Asian people has exposed flaws in the approach, some scientists and activists said.
They want more comprehensive data collection across the continent to improve understanding about how and why COVID-19 affects different communities, and thereby help countries tailor testing and care to better protect them.
There is no easy fix. Even in Britain, where more detailed data on race and ethnicity is available, there is debate over the root causes of higher infections among certain groups.
The conditions people live and work in explain most of the disproportionate impact, studies show. Whether minority communities trust hospital staff to treat them fairly, or have equal access to healthcare, could also play a role.
A recent survey by ClearView in the United Kingdom, for example, showed that 60% of Black people did not feel their health was equally protected by the National Health Service as white people's.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said earlier this year that fuller data in countries including Brazil, Britain and the United States served an important purpose.
""The data tells us of a devastating impact from COVID-19 on people of African descent, as well as ethnic minorities in some countries,"" she said.
""In many other places, we expect similar patterns are occurring, but we are unable to say for sure, given that data by race and ethnicity is simply not being collected or reported.""
Spurred by both the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests, the European Union vowed in September to look into the obstacles to harmonising data collection across Europe.
It said it wanted to understand ""structural aspects of racism and discrimination"", and a roundtable on the issue is planned for the end of 2021, the European Commission told Reuters.
Some rights groups and researchers who have been calling for more comprehensive data for decades were sceptical that the move would be enough to make a major difference.
""I don't want just another report,"" said Mamadou Ba, head of the Portuguese anti-racism organisation, SOS Racismo. ""We've heard this before. We need targeted action.""
DATA AS POLICY TOOL
Disaggregating data to reveal patterns among subgroups of the population can be used to address inequality.
In the United States, ethnicity data allowed authorities to identify that rates of HIV/AIDS were growing significantly faster among African Americans and Hispanics than the general population, prompting the development of targeted programmes to reduce infection in these groups.
This April, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began collating data from states for a weekly tracker on COVID-19 infections and deaths by race.
But most countries in Europe have been less willing to record the racial makeup of their societies, sticking to a ""colour-blind"" model of assimilation of immigrants.
A history of state persecution in Nazi Germany and beyond has left some groups like the Roma reluctant to have their ethnicity recorded.
Instead, authorities use proxies such as the birthplace of parents, language, or religion.
In Germany, a study on the extent to which migration background affects people's search for work, accommodation, and their treatment by businesses, local councils and the police is currently being debated.
But this approach leaves gaps, its critics say. A Black child born in Europe to parents also born in Europe would be unseen in such statistics.
In the absence of comprehensive data, agencies like the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and research institutes like INED in France have conducted smaller studies to outline racial inequalities before and during the pandemic.
FRA conducted a survey of 6,000 Black people in 12 member states in 2019 showing that Black people in the European Union are three times as likely as their white counterparts to live in overcrowded housing, with 55% at or below the poverty threshold.
U.S. and British studies have shown that such conditions can exacerbate vulnerability to the coronavirus.
In France, government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye called for the debate on ethnicity data to be revisited, but was rebuffed by the president's office. [nL8N2DS5JM]
In July, however, the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) did publish the country of birth of coronavirus victims in March and April.
Mortality for those born in sub-Saharan Africa increased 114% in 2020 compared with 22% for French-born residents, the data showed.
EPICOV, the country's nationwide study on coronavirus infection, provides data on cases among first and second-generation immigrants.
But what is needed, some researchers argue, is to know whether people of colour are more likely to die once infected - both migrants, and French non-whites.
""Your likelihood of becoming infected is related to how you live,"" Patrick Simon of INED said.
""But the real question is, what happens when you're sick? Are you taken seriously in healthcare services? Are you treated well? Do you wait longer? And is there a link to race?""
FROM DATA TO ACTION? 
In Britain, where ethnicity data collection has been in place for several decades, there is debate over how to respond to studies showing that poverty or overcrowded housing among ethnic minorities is largely to blame for higher coronavirus infection rates.
Equality think-tank the Runnymede Trust and research institute IPPR reported in October that 58,000 more people would have died in the first wave of the coronavirus in Britain if the white population had faced the same risk as Black communities.
But Raghib Ali, a government adviser on coronavirus and ethnicity, argued that ethnicity was a proxy for other forms of risk and did not merit classification as a separate risk factor. [nL8N2HC684]
A report by Public Health England (PHE) in June suggested that people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds may be less likely to seek care because of racism.
But Ali said in October there was no evidence that minorities were treated differently in hospital.
""They didn't present any objective evidence,"" Ali said of the PHE report. ""I don't think structural racism is a reasonable explanation.""
Halima Begum, director of the Runnymede Trust, disagrees.
""We know racism limits people's access to services – from health, to housing,"" she told Reuters.
""Unions have told us minorities are less likely to challenge their bosses over still going to work during the pandemic. They're often more hesitant to access the health system for fear of not being treated well.""
In France, too, advocates say the response to INSEE's data and lessons from Britain show that even with data available, the battle is proving that disproportionate socioeconomic disadvantage is in part caused by racial discrimination.
""Of course, they are dying because they are poor,"" said Stephanie Mulot, a sociologist researching racial inequalities in France.

""But why are they so likely to be poor? It is accumulated discrimination - in access to a comfortable home, to healthcare, to employment. This is what we want to prove.""

576,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 11:46PM ET</span>","In Indonesia, making of a mayor sparks talk of nation's newest dynasty","By Agustinus Beo Da Costa, Kate Lamb and Stanley Widianto
SURAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Running against an obscure rival, the son of Indonesian President Joko Widodo is expected to cruise to victory in an election next month for the post his father once held as mayor of Surakarta.
The political aspirations of his eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, have raised suspicions that the president, widely referred to as Jokowi, is forming a new dynasty to elbow its way in among Indonesia's old elites.
Unrelated to the powerful families that have dominated government, business and the military in Southeast Asia's largest nation, Jokowi was regarded as an outsider when he was elected in 2014.
During six years in power, Jokowi has prioritised infrastructure and development projects, but some Suharto era cronies remain powerful more than two decades on from Indonesia's democratic reform.
Jokowi rejects the notion that his son's entry into politics shows a new dynasty is about to join the club. 
“Everyone in Indonesia has political rights. I never directed my children,"" Jokowi told Reuters last week. “It's a competition. You can win or you can lose.”
Gibran is among a host of political newcomers with influential relatives in the world’s third-biggest democracy, and analysts say Indonesia's politics is increasingly becoming a family affair.
Compared to regional elections in 2015 when there were 52 ‘dynastic’ candidates, this year there are 146, according to research by Yoes Kenawas, a PhD candidate in political science at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University in Illinois.
Among them are not only the president’s son, but his son-in-law, the vice president’s daughter, and the defence minister’s niece. In one constituency on the outskirts of the capital Jakarta three candidates are dynastic.
“Democracy is just facilitating a few people to access power,” Titi Anggraini from elections watchdog, Perludem, said, bemoaning the trend.
Indonesian politics has long been dominated by kingmakers in Java, the most populated island on the planet, and home to the capital of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation. 
But in the president's Javanese hometown of Surakarta, a city better known as Solo, some 500 kilometres (310 miles) from Jakarta, Gibran's candidacy has generated its own special controversy.
""EMPTY BOX""
Halim HD, a 69-year-old, panama hat wearing activist, has long been a thorn in the side of well-connected politicians.
Two years ago when a relation of the then vice president ran unopposed in an election in Sulawesi, Halim started an ‘empty box’ campaign - a push to vote for the blank box that appears on ballot papers in uncontested polls.
The empty box won.
This year when it appeared the president’s son, backed by a coalition of 9 political parties, also had no opponent, Halim revived the campaign.
“In the context of modern politics,” he said, “These empty boxes are a sign something is wrong.""
Ultimately, just hours before registration closed on Sept. 6, a rival candidate did emerge.
Bagyo Wahyono, a 59-year-old tailor, had given provisional notification last year of his intention to run, the local elections commission said, but the late confirmation of his candidacy still surprised many people.
Sugeng Riyanto, deputy speaker at the Solo parliament, said that he believed based on information he had received that there had been a push not to have an empty box in fear of the optics, especially if it went on to receive many votes.
“That would be tremendously embarrassing, not only for Gibran but also the president,” said Sugeng, a member of the only political party not supporting Jokowi's son.
He said he believed Bagyo's candidacy, was ""about avoiding that scenario"". Bagyo denied that. Neither Gibran's campaign nor the presidency responded to requests for comment on the accusation.
COLLECTING NUMBERS
Describing himself as an anti-establishment candidate, Bagyo is backed by a little-known social organisation called Tikus Pithi Hanata Baris.
“I ran because of my capacity to break the establishment, [to show] anyone can choose and be chosen,” Bagyo told Reuters.
Even for an independent, some observers find Bagyo's candidacy odd as he lacks strong social or political capital with any mass organisation or political network.
“This candidate in Solo, he seems to have come from nowhere,” said Wawan Mas’udi, political scientist from Gadjah Mada University.
To qualify as an independent Bagyo was required to collect almost 36,000 signatures.
A spokesperson for Bagyo’s campaign team, Budi Yuwono, said they first started collecting IDs door to door at the start of 2019. The team avoided social media initially, he said, because they were worried that political parties could try to obstruct their campaign.
It also seemed to have avoided attention. Few people Reuters spoke to in Solo said they had heard of Bagyo until September, when he registered his candidacy, launched a campaign website and activated social media pages. 
Reuters spoke to people on the list of signatories who denied backing Bagyo's bid.
Paralegal Tresno Subagyo, for example, was among those surprised to find an election official at his door checking that he had signed up.
“I never gave my support to Bagyo,” he said, “Nor handed over my ID.” 
Johan Syafaat Mahanani, from a community election monitoring group, said there were dozens of such cases.
“They were just normal people, afraid to report it to authorities,” he said.
Another resident told Reuters two people had visited his home and taken a photo of his ID, only to explain why afterwards.
""They came merely to make sure Bagyo could run,"" he said, adding that at least seven neighbours had similar encounters.
Gibran’s campaign team did not respond to questions about the authenticity of Bagyo’s support.
Bagyo's campaign team said it was possible there could have been ""one or two"" mistakes in the collection of signatures, but not amounting to thousands.
A local elections commissioner, Suryo Baruno, said that 14,000 names listed for Bagyo were deemed ineligible after two rounds of verification. The campaign subsequently sought additional signatories to meet its target. 
A separate elections supervisory body later said it investigated a report about fraudulent use of IDs, and found no irregularities.
Solo parliamentary deputy speaker Sugeng Riyanto said he believed what had happened was ""a stain on democracy"".
IMAGE-MAKING
When Gibran registered his candidacy, riding a vintage bicycle to the elections commission, he conjured up an image of his father, who did the same when he lodged his bid for the presidency.
Confronted by accusations he is perpetuating Indonesia’s dynastic politics, Gibran told Reuters he ""welcomed all criticism"", and believed he could create positive change in more people’s lives as a mayor than as an entrepreneur. 
A Kompas poll this August, showed nearly 61% of respondents did not like dynastic politics, but in Solo, a city famous for its ageing palace and traditional batik, voters were pragmatic.

“There has been political dynasties for generations,” shrugged Hartanto, a 42-year-old pedi-cab driver, “What’s important is they know their people.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Care farms nestled in the British countryside are providing a lifeline for people struggling with mental health during the pandemic, allowing them to swap therapy sessions on Zoom for the joys of fresh air, mucking out cow sheds and cuddling donkeys.
With vital public services for vulnerable people shut down or reduced to video calls because of social distancing measures, care farms have been able to stay open as activities take place in wide open spaces.
At Future Roots in the southern county of Dorset, 14-year-old Liam Holt has found that spending time outdoors working with animals and other people has had a transformational effect on his state of mind.
""It's made a huge impact for me,"" he said.
""I had a lot of stress issues, high stress levels, quickfire snaps, anger, just a lot of anger and that, and lockdown did not help me ... I had no control over it. The person that was helping me, I couldn't see her face-to-face.""
On a sunny, blustery November day when Reuters reporters visited the farm, children in muddy boots were busy cleaning a cow shed, feeding chickens, guinea pigs and rabbits, stroking cows and donkeys, even driving tractors.
Future Roots has been functioning as a care farm since 2006. Children and young people can be referred there by their schools for animal-assisted therapy and training in agriculture and cookery skills.
""I'd even be dead or in prison if it wasn't for this place, because in no way I would have been able to cope in society if I hadn't come here,"" said Abi Edmed, 25, who used to come as a child and is now a trainee nurse. She still comes to help out, as a friend.
Edmed said she endured a lot of trauma as a child, resulting in her becoming aggressive. She said the care farm had helped her to process her trauma.
""It was actually just being able to wander off, go chat to a cow, (I’m) very known for doing that,"" she said, smiling. ""The cow can't tell my secrets.""
'THEY CAN'T TAKE IT'
Julie Plumley, a Dorset farmer's daughter and professional social worker who founded the care farm, said Future Roots has helped young people for whom social distancing was devastating.
""The young people here can't take it. They couldn't take Zoom therapy sessions because they need a relationship with people, and that's really hard on a computer,"" she said.
For Emily Trice, 15, the farm has been a safe haven from struggles at home and at school. ""The best bit is seeing how everybody is enjoying it and having fun with all the animals,"" she said.
At another care farm, Pathways in the eastern county of Suffolk, founder Geoff Stevens was on a mission against loneliness.
""Isolation is gripping people. They're stuck away in their house,"" he said. ""You bring them out here and they start mixing with 5, 10, 12 people, they've got relationships going, they've got conversations going, they're using their grey matter.""
Sally Payne, 31, was filling troughs with feed for llamas, grooming donkeys and clearing out animal pens, alongside her mother Susan. Both smiled and laughed as they worked.
""I have autism and anxiety and depression, so I like coming here because it gives me structure, which is good for the autism, and fresh air and exercise that is good for the mental health,"" said Payne.
Susan Payne said the care farm was a bulwark against loneliness for her too.

""It has given me a sort of back-up team, you know. You can feel very alone when you're dealing with a child with difficulties.""

The star of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and ""Magic Mike"" appeared to be considering the idea when discussing politics with syndicated talk radio host Hugh Hewitt in an interview posted online on Wednesday.
Asked if he would run for governor of Texas or another political office, the actor said he was undecided without ruling it out. McConaughey, 51, was born and raised in Texas before moving to Los Angeles and forging a career in romantic comedies such as ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.""
""I mean, that wouldn't be up to me. It would be up to the people more than it would me,"" said McConaughey.
""I would say this,"" he continued. ""Look, politics seems to be a broken business to me right now. And when politics redefines its purpose, I could be a hell of a lot more interested.""
In the interview, he described his political philosophy as being ""behind personal values to rebind our social contracts with each other as Americans.""
But he seemed some way from having made any decision to swap acting for politics.
""I still question how much you can really get done in politics, and I don't know if politics is my avenue to get what maybe I am best equipped to get done,"" he said.
McConaughey, who won an Oscar for his role in 2013 AIDS drama ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" would be one of a series of celebrities who have flirted with, or won, political office in the United States.

They include Presidents Donald Trump and the late Ronald Reagan, former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Carmel Mayor Clint Eastwood and former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Navy commander in Asia on Thursday welcomed an agreement by Japan and Australia to tighten military cooperation that will bolster the United States in a region where China's influence is growing.
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Australian leader Scott Morrison on Tuesday agreed in principle on a Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) that will more closely align the U.S. allies through a legal framework allowing each other's troops to visit for training and to conduct joint military operations.
""That kind of agreement is really helpful and encouraging to everybody in the region. We are very supportive of that agreement and we look forward to exercising along right with them,"" Vice Admiral William Merz, commander of the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet, which is headquartered in Japan, said during a roundtable briefing.
The agreement between Canberra and Tokyo, Japan's first with another country since a similar agreement with Washington in 1960, comes as the two countries work more closely with the United States and India as part of an informal grouping known as the ""Quad"" as they grow more concerned about Chinese activity in the South China Sea and East China Sea. 
Suga hosted foreign ministers from the Quad in Tokyo last month before heading to Vietnam and Indonesia to deepen ties with key Southeast Asian nations.
Merz, who spoke with Lieutenant General H. Stacy Clardy, the commanding general of III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, said greater cooperation in the region is not aimed at China.
""There is no attempt to contain China or anyone else, we are trying to create an environment of inclusion,"" he said.
Beijing, which says its intentions in the region are peaceful, has described the Quad as a ""mini-NATO.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed to provide collective security against the then Soviet Union and is still seen as a threat by Russia as it expands to include some European states that were formerly part of the Eastern Bloc. 

The Japan-Australia agreement also came under similar criticism in China on Tuesday, with the state-backed newspaper the Global Times saying the United States ""is using its two anchors in the Asia-Pacific region to push forward the construction of an Asian version of NATO.""

KABUL (Reuters) - In a small art gallery in the Afghan capital, Marzia Panahi watches as one of the young artists she has just employed applies paint to a framed felt canvas propped up against a easel.
Panahi, 21, set up the Namad Gallery at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in September.
Her aim was to revive the use of felt in art, to showcase her war-torn country's creativity and to try to create jobs for young people hit hard by the pandemic and the economic crisis it has caused.
""When COVID-19 cases increased in Afghanistan, I saw how unemployment was getting higher, and when we realized how deadly poverty can be...I put together a team of young people so that we could at least be useful to ourselves and those around us, and become entrepreneurs,"" she said.
The international relations student's company now employs 10 people, including three artists, and sells paintings to local art lovers for between $100 and $200 each. 
Afghanistan, where more than 60% of the population is below the age of 25, has struggled with high youth unemployment.
The pandemic has exacerbated its economic problems, with the World Bank predicting that more than 70% of the population will slip beneath the poverty line in 2020.
In addition to generating jobs, Panahi said she wanted to find a way of reintroducing felt to traditional arts and crafts in Afghanistan. Historically it had been produced to make carpets, she said, but in recent years its use had declined.
""Because people have turned to a more modern life and are no longer buyers of felt products, we wanted to make it possible to re-use felt in a variety of ways,"" she explained.
Faiqa Sultani, a 27-year old artist, said she had initially felt depressed due to the lockdown and lack of opportunities, but since joining Namad her mood had improved.
""When I paint, it is a kind of expression of my feelings on canvas, paper, or felt that I enjoy,"" she said.
""Painting on felt means that we can revive the old traditions and show people that we can use our Afghan resources and make our lives more beautiful.""

583,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",Australia PM Defiant After China Airs 14 Grievances,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he wouldn’t compromise Australia’s national security and sovereignty, as Beijing ramped up its criticism of his government and warned it against making China an enemy.
“Australia will always be ourselves,” Morrison said in a television interview Thursday with the Nine Network. “We will always set our own laws and our own rules according to our national interests -- not at the behest of any other nation, whether that’s the U.S. or China or anyone else.”
A Chinese diplomat in Canberra gave a document to Australian media outlets outlining 14 grievances and accusing the nation of “poisoning bilateral relations,” largely echoing complaints aired by the Foreign Ministry in Beijing in recent days. A Chinese government official said in a briefing with a reporter that the country was angry, and would become an enemy if it was made the enemy, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
China is placing increased pressure on Australia through trade sanctions and reprisals as it criticizes a raft of Australian policies. While ministerial ties with the U.S. ally have been in a deep freeze since April, when Morrison’s government called for independent investigators to enter Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus, the prime minister’s visit to strategic partner Japan this week to sign a new defense pact has exacerbated tensions.
Morrison, who said Thursday he had seen the “unofficial document that’s come out of the Chinese embassy,” added in the TV interview that Australia’s values, democracy and sovereignty “are not up for trade.” His government has labeled Chinese trade reprisals launched this year as “economic coercion.”
“We won’t be compromising on the fact that we’ll set what our foreign investment laws are, or how we build our 5G telecommunications networks, or how we run our systems to protect that are protecting against any interference,” Morrison said.
Morrison visited counterpart Yoshihide Suga in Toyko in his bid to build a coalition of “like-minded” democracies pushing back against what Beijing’s increasing influence in the Asia-Pacific region.
As well as agreeing to a legal framework that will allow the military of each nation to stay in the other’s country to conduct joint exercises, Morrison and Suga issued a joint statement with criticisms of Chinese policies, including their “strong opposition to any coercive or unilateral attempts to change the status quo and thereby increase tensions in the region.”
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday that the “Chinese side is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to their press statement in which they accused China on the South China Sea and East China Sea issue.” The two nations “blatantly interfered in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs,” he said.
On Tuesday, Zhao gave reporters in Beijing a detailed explanation for souring ties, including Australia involving itself in domestic affairs in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan, accusing it of spying, calling for the Wuhan probe and for rejecting “Chinese companies seeking to invest in Australia under the excuse of national security.”
Ties between the major trading partners have been strained since 2018 when Canberra barred Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network and introducing anti-foreign interference laws aimed at halting Beijing’s “meddling” in domestic affairs.
“We stand up with other countries, whether it be on human rights issues or things that are happening around the world, including in China,” Morrison said. “Now if that is the source of tensions between Australia and China, well I can assure you that Australia will continue to be ourselves, we’ll continue to act in our own national interests, and pursue partnerships like the one” with Japan, which would “only strengthen stability and peace in the Indo-Pacific.”

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's new President Francisco Sagasti unveiled his cabinet on Wednesday, appointing a constitutional lawyer to be prime minister as the government seeks to tamp down angry protests that have rocked the country's political class.
The new government was formed a day after liberal centrist Sagasti was sworn into office after a tumultuous week that saw the departure of two presidents and marches in the street that were marred by the deaths of two young protesters.
Sagasti appointed Violeta Bermúdez, a legal expert on vulnerable populations and gender politics, to head the cabinet of 18 ministers, with Waldo Mendoza, an economist with a background in tax oversight, to oversee the economy portfolio.
The appointment of Sagasti, after his conservative predecessor Manuel Merino resigned on Sunday, has helped calm protests and ease jittery markets.

Peru, the world's second largest producer of copper, is headed for its worst economic contraction in a century after being hit by one of the world's deadliest per capita outbreaks of COVID-19. There are new elections planned for April 2021.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The head of Australia's Defence Force announced on Thursday allegations that its special forces soldiers carried out 39 unlawful killings in Afghanistan.
Australia in 2016 launched an inquiry into the conduct of its special forces personnel between 2005 and 2016 amid allegations by local media about the killing of unarmed men and children.
Detailing the findings, General Angus John Campbell said the report found evidence that 25 Australian special forces personnel killed prisoners, farmers or other civilians.
""[The Inspector General] found there to be credible information to substantiate 23 incidents of alleged unlawful killing of 39 people by 25 Australian Special Forces personnel, predominantly from the Special Air Service Regiment,"" Campbell told reporters in Canberra.

""We urge the Chinese central authorities to re-consider their actions against Hong Kong’s elected legislature and immediately reinstate the Legislative Council members,"" foreign ministers from Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States said in a joint statement.
Hong Kong expelled four opposition members from its legislature last week after Beijing gave city authorities new powers to curb dissent. The move triggered mass resignations by Hong Kong's pro-democracy opposition lawmakers.
It also raised further alarm in the West about the level of Hong Kong's autonomy, promised under a ""one country, two systems"" formula when Britain ended its colonial rule and handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.
""China’s action is a clear breach of its international obligations under the legally binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" the five countries said.
Britain now considers China has broken the Joint Declaration three times, including with national security legislation for Hong Kong introduced this year. 
Washington has already imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other Chinese officials over the crackdown, and has warned of further steps.
Police in Hong Kong said they had arrested three former lawmakers on Wednesday morning over May and June incidents in which foul-smelling liquid was thrown in the city’s legislature, an act police said was intended to cause harm.
China denies curbing rights and freedoms in the global financial hub but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved swiftly to stifle dissent after anti-government protests flared in June last year and plunged the city into crisis.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister has responded to China's list of grievances over his country's human rights diplomacy, free media and investment policies by saying ""we will always be Australia"".
China's embassy in Canberra gave a list of complaints about Australia's China policy to local media company Nine on Wednesday, a day after China's foreign ministry in Beijing listed the complaints in a regular press briefing.
Tensions mounted this year between Australia and its largest trading partner China, after Beijing imposed a series of trade reprisals after Australia led calls for an international inquiry into the coronavirus.
Australian government ministers have recently said they want to improve communication with Beijing, but China's foreign ministry has said Australia needs to ""take concrete actions to correct their mistakes"".
On Thursday, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison referred to the Chinese embassy's list and said Australia acted in its own interests and would not change its policies. 
In an interview with Seven Network's Sunrise program, Morrison said: ""Having a free media, having parliamentarians elected and able to speak their minds is a cause for concern, as well as speaking up on human rights in concert with other countries like Canada, New Zealand, the UK and others in international forums, if this is the cause for tension in that relationship, then it would seem that the tension is that Australia is just being Australia.""
On Tuesday, Australia and Japan agreed on a breakthrough defence pact during a visit by Morrison to Tokyo, prompting a rebuke from China over statements the two leaders made.
Back in Australia, Morrison told media that it was a mistake for China to believe Australia acted at the behest of the United States. He said Australia formed trade and defence arrangements with Japan and other countries, and set its foreign investment rules, in accordance with its national interests.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Wednesday said the cause of the deteriorating relationship is ""Australia's repeated wrong acts and remarks"".
On Tuesday, Zhao read complaints about Australia's actions including ""mistakes on issues concerning China's core interests like Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan"", including actions in the Human Rights Council, and support for Taiwan entering the World Health Organisation.
China also criticized Australia's action against foreign interference, and being the first country to ban Chinese companies from participating in its 5G network.
The embassy said more than 10 Chinese investments had been blocked in Australia on national security grounds.

""We won't be compromising on the fact that we will set what our foreign investment laws are, or how we build our 5G telecommunications networks, or how we run our systems of protecting against interference,"" Morrison told Nine Television.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump has made no plans to host a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies after cancelling a June gathering because of the COVID-19 pandemic, three diplomatic sources said on Wednesday.
The Republican president, who has refused to accept the victory of Democrat Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election, has not made a final decision, but time is running out to plan a major summit before he hands over power on Jan. 20, said one of the diplomatic sources and a fourth source familiar with the matter.
Three diplomatic sources said there had been no outreach by the Trump administration on dates or an agenda for a possible G7 summit. While an online meeting would still be possible, there had been no work on any kind of joint statement - a process that typically takes months, said one of the sources.
The White House declined to comment.
Britain, which assumes the rotating presidency of the G7 from the United States in January, last week congratulated Biden on his victory and invited him to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Scotland next year, as well as a G7 summit.
Trump first canceled plans for a June 10 in-person summit in March due to the pandemic, but later sought to revive it, only to drop the plans in May after German leader Angela Merkel said she would not attend and others expressed concerns. 
In August, he said he was inclined to host the meeting in a ""calmer atmosphere"" after the presidential election, but no further action has been taken, said one of the sources. 
Trump also said he would expand the invitee list to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India, dismissing the G7 as ""a very outdated group of countries."".
Trump's push to include Russia met with a frosty reception from Germany and other allies.
Russia was expelled from what was then the G8 in 2014 when Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, was U.S. president, after Moscow annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine. Russia still holds the territory, and various G7 governments have rebuffed previous calls from Trump to readmit Moscow.

The G7 groups the United States, Britain, France, Japan, Germany, Italy and Canada, and the European Union also attends. The group began meeting in 1975, initially without Canada.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's opposition on Wednesday called on Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to get tougher on China, including by officially banning Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's 5G technology from being used in the country.
Opposition parties passed a non-binding motion put forward by the Conservatives calling China a threat to Canadian interests and values, and urging the government to draft a plan to ""combat China's growing foreign operations"" in Canada.
""We call on the Liberal government to finally grow a spine and make a decision on Huawei's involvement in Canada's 5G network,"" Conservative leader Erin O'Toole said.
5G networks offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than 4G networks and are expected to power everything from telemedicine and remote surgery to self-driving cars.
Trudeau heads a minority government that depends on one of three opposition parties to pass legislation and stay afloat. Last month, the prime minister appeared to seek an early vote, without success, but many in Ottawa now expect a snap election next year.
The arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a U.S. arrest warrant two years ago put Canada in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war, and Ottawa continues to struggle to respond to Beijing's aggressive tactics.
After Meng's arrest, China arrested two Canadian citizens for alleged spying, and they have been imprisoned ever since. China also cut off imports of canola. Meng is fighting extradition to the United States.
Trudeau's government has put on hold any decision on whether to allow Huawei 5G technology, even though Ottawa's main allies in the intelligence-sharing Five-Eyes group - the United States, the UK, Australia and New Zealand - have all taken steps to ban Huawei.
With U.S.-China relations at their worst in decades, Washington has been pushing governments around the world to squeeze out Huawei, arguing it would hand over data to the Chinese government for spying. Huawei denies it spies for China.
Trudeau repeated that his government was awaiting a recommendation from the country's intelligence agencies.
""Huawei has always supported - and continues to support - the government's evidence-based review of potential 5G providers,"" Huawei Canada Vice President Alykhan Velshi said in a statement, adding the company ""has never received a complaint"" from Canada about a security breach.

The opposition motion, which passed 179-146, called on the government within 30 days to officially ban Huawei 5G and come up with a plan to counter Chinese operations aimed at intimidating Chinese nationals living in Canada.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's ruling party leader accused opposition politicians of having ""blood on their hands"" for supporting protests the government blames for helping spread COVID-19, as police kept demonstrators against an abortion ruling away from parliament.
Protesters had planned to blockade parliament as part of demonstrations against a top court ruling that amounted to a near-total ban on abortion. 
""All the demonstrations you supported have cost the lives of many people -- you have blood on your hands,"" Law and Justice (PiS) party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told opposition lawmakers in the parliament.
PiS have blamed the protests for spreading COVID-19.
Police kept protesters away from the building and local media reported that scuffles broke out in the city centre. A left-wing lawmaker said deputy speaker Wlodzimierz Czarzasty, a member of their party, was beaten by police.
Television footage showed a line of riot police blocking the route of protesters.
""Due to the aggression directed against police officers, direct coercion measures were used in the form of gas,"" Warsaw police said on Twitter.
The police also said officers had been sent to investigate the police intervention concerning Czarzasty.
Earlier footage from private broadcaster TVN 24 showed protesters playing drums and dancing in the street, while others carried placards with slogans including ""Women's Hell"".
While centred on abortion, the protests have seen a broader outpouring of anger at Poland's nationalist rulers and their allies in the Catholic church, the latest manifestation of a battle between liberals and religious conservatives that this time touches on the government’s response to COVID-19.
Pictures on social media showed large numbers of police vans outside parliament before the protest was due to start.
""The fact that there are so many police officers ... shows that PiS are afraid of women,"" left-wing lawmaker Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus told Reuters by telephone.
A PiS spokeswomen could not immediately be reached for comment.

The protests took place as Polish lawmakers met in the parliament to discuss issues such as the country's veto of the European Union's budget and a post-COVID recovery package.

Tweets from the White House National Security Council said O'Brien would meet leaders in both countries ""to reaffirm the strength of our bilateral relationships and to discuss regional security cooperation."" 
O'Brien's trip follows a visit to Hanoi last month by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. That visit came a week after Vietnam freed a Vietnamese-born U.S. citizen, Michael Nguyen, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for ""attempting to overthrow the state."" 
The former Vietnam War foes now have warm relations in spite of U.S. concerns about Hanoi's human rights practices.
Washington also has concerns about human rights in the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte has been engaged in a war on drugs in which thousands of urban poor have been killed, many in mysterious circumstances.
On a visit last year, Pompeo assured the Philippines that Washington would come to its defense if it came under attack in the South China Sea, where Manila has competing claims with China and other countries, including Vietnam.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who was defeated in his Nov. 3 re-election bid and is due to hand over power to President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20, had declared the Asia-Pacific and competition with China a foreign policy priority.
Trump faced criticism from former officials and other commentators for having O'Brien take part in his place in last weekend's virtual East Asia Summit, on the sidelines of which 15 countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines, signed a major China-backed regional trade deal.

Trump plans to represent the United States at a virtual Asia-Pacific summit this week in which his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping plans to take part, a U.S. official told Reuters.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Storm Iota unleashed flash floods in areas already waterlogged with rain, forcing more than 200,000 people across Central America to flee their homes with at least a couple dozen confirmed dead by Wednesday afternoon.
The strongest storm on record ever to hit Nicaragua, Iota struck the coast late on Monday, unleashing Category 5 magnitude winds and inundating villages still reeling from the impact two weeks ago of Eta, another major hurricane.
Iota had largely dissipated over El Salvador on Wednesday, but authorities across Nicaragua and Honduras were still battling to cope with the devastating flooding the weather front had left behind in the deeply impoverished region.
Some of the hardest-hit communities were still inaccessible.
Central American authorities have confirmed 24 deaths so far. The majority of the victims are in Nicaragua, where authorities say a mother and her four children were swept away by a river that overflowed its banks, while a landslide in the north of the country killed at least eight people, with many more missing.
In Honduras, five members of a family, including three children, were buried alive after a landslide swept away their home in the western department of Ocotepeque near the border with El Salvador and Guatemala, according to police.
Two deaths have been confirmed in Panama and one in El Salvador.
In Colombia, authorities say two people died when the storm battered the islands of the country's Caribbean archipelago near the coast of Central America, bringing the storm's total death toll to at least 26 people.
Some 160,000 Nicaraguans and 70,000 Hondurans have been forced to flee to shelters.
Despite the dissolution of Iota, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said the storm's remnants could trigger more flooding and mudslides across Central America through Thursday.

The remnants of Iota were drifting west toward the Pacific Ocean, according to the NHC.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed broad sanctions targeting Iran, blacklisting a foundation controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and taking aim at what Washington called Iran's human rights abuses a year after a deadly crackdown on anti-government demonstrators. 
The sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury Department, which also targeted Iran's intelligence minister, are the latest action to reinforce the ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran pursued by President Donald Trump's administration. They come little more than two months before Trump is due to hand over power to Joe Biden after losing a Nov. 3 election.
The department imposed sanctions on what it described as a key patronage network for Khamenei. It said it blacklisted the Bonyad Mostazafan, or the Foundation of the Oppressed, which is controlled by Khamenei, in a move also targeting 10 individuals and 50 subsidiaries of the foundation in sectors including energy, mining and financial services.
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets of those targeted and generally bar Americans from doing business with them. Anyone who engages in certain transactions with these individuals and entities runs the risk of being hit with U.S. sanctions.
The charitable foundation - an economic, cultural and social-welfare institution - has amassed vast amounts of wealth to the detriment of the rest of the Iranian economy and controls hundreds of companies and properties confiscated since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, insiders say.
The Treasury Department in a statement accused Khamenei of using the foundation's holdings to ""enrich his office, reward his political allies, and persecute the regime's enemies.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement: ""The United States will continue to target key officials and revenue-generating sources that enable the regime's ongoing repression of its own people.""
'SIGN OF DESPERATION'
Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York, called the new sanctions ""a sign of desperation"" by Trump's administration.
""These latest attempts to continue a failed policy of 'maximum pressure' against Iran and its citizens will fail, just as all other attempts have,"" Miryousefi said.
The head of the blacklisted foundation, Parviz Fattah, tweeted: ""The struggle of the declining U.S. government cannot impact the foundation's anti-sanction activities and its productivity."" 
Fattah, who was among those blacklisted on Wednesday, described Trump as ""a loser and disturbed person.""
U.S.-Iranian tensions have risen since Trump two years ago abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and restored harsh economic sanctions designed to force Tehran into a wider negotiation on curbing its nuclear program, development of ballistic missiles and support for regional proxy forces.
President-elect Biden, set to take office on Jan. 20, has said he will return the United States to the nuclear deal, if Iran resumes compliance. 
Some analysts have said Trump's piling-on of additional U.S. sanctions appeared to be aimed at making it harder for Biden to re-engage with Iran after taking office.
""The administration is clearly, and I think transparently, trying to raise the political cost for Biden to re-engage with Iran and lift the nuclear deal sanctions,"" said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst with Eurasia Group. 
Rome said Wednesday's move could embarrass the supreme leader, dissuade non-U.S. companies from dealing with the charitable foundation even if sanctions are eventually lifted, and put the Biden administration in the potentially difficult position of justifying why they did so.
The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on Iranian Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi and accused his ministry of playing a role in serious human rights abuses against Iranians, including during last year's protests.
The U.S. State Department also designated two Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officials, accusing them of involvement in the killing of nearly 150 people in the city of Mahshahr during last year's crackdown. The action bars them and their immediate families from traveling to the United States.
The 2019 crackdown may have been the bloodiest repression of protesters in Iran since the 1979 revolution.
Reuters reported last year that about 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest that started on Nov. 15, 2019. The toll was provided to Reuters by three Iranian Interior Ministry officials.
Iran's Interior Ministry has said around 225 people were killed during the protests, which erupted after state media announced that gas prices would rise by as much as 200% and the revenue would be used to help needy families.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement urged other nations to take action against Iran for its human rights abuses.

""Pfizer made a proposal to the Brazilian government, in line with deals we closed in other countries - including in Latin America, that would permit the vaccination of millions of Brazilians in the first half, subject to regulatory approval,"" the company said in a statement.
Brazil has the third-worst outbreak of coronavirus in the world by number of cases, after the United States and India. 
On Tuesday, the Imperial College London released data showing that the rate of infection in Brazil had accelerated to 1.1, meaning every 100 people with coronavirus infect 110 people. That is the first time in weeks the figure has been above one.
Brazil's Health Ministry said it met with Pfizer on Tuesday and would buy the vaccine if proven safe and if health regulator Anvisa registered it. The ministry said it will also meet this week with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) , India's Bharat Biotech and the makers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine as it draws up immunization plans.
Anvisa has signed off on rules to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine approvals, according to a notice published in the government gazette on Wednesday. 

The new rules allow labs to present data to Anvisa continuously as it is generated rather than waiting for all documentation to be complete. Regulatory impact analyses and public consultations that are normally required will also be waived.

597,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. investigators were told to take 'no further action' on Caterpillar, ex-client of Barr","By Aram Roston
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Before William Barr became President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the U.S. Department of Justice, he represented  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), a Fortune 100 company, in a federal criminal investigation by the department.
Much was at stake for Caterpillar: Since 2018, the Internal Revenue Service has been demanding $2.3 billion in payments from the company in connection with the tax matters under criminal investigation. The company is contesting that finding.
A week after Barr was nominated for the job of attorney general, Justice officials in Washington told the investigative team in the active criminal probe of Caterpillar to take “no further action” in the case, according to an email written by one of the agents and reviewed by Reuters.
The decision, the email said, came from the Justice Department’s Tax Division and the office of the deputy attorney general, who was then Rod Rosenstein.
“I was instructed on December 13, 2018,” wrote the agent, Jason LeBeau, “that the Tax Division and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General jointly came to the decision that no further action was to be taken on the matter until further notice.” LeBeau, an inspector general agent at the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, declined interview requests from Reuters.
Since then, a source close to the case says, the investigation has “stalled.” The order to freeze the Caterpillar investigation has not been previously reported.
Reuters was unable to determine why Justice issued the “no further action” directive. It was not issued by Barr, as it came before he was confirmed. A Justice Department spokesperson said Barr recused himself from any Caterpillar discussions once he became attorney general, but declined further comment. Barr, in testimony during his confirmation hearings, said rules of legal privilege precluded him from discussing his work for the company.
Rosenstein, who left the government in May 2019, did not respond to a phone message and emails seeking comment. The IRS declined to comment about the case.
Caterpillar, for its part, has reported to investors that the grand jury investigation is ongoing. The company told Reuters the DOJ’s Tax Division is reviewing the investigation. Caterpillar has said for years that it did nothing wrong.
Potential conflicts of interest, whether real or apparent, often arise when high-powered lawyers switch between private practice and government service. Bruce A. Green, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Fordham Law School, said it is not unheard of for attorney generals to have clients who had business before the DOJ. He noted that in 2009, President Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, recused himself from a case involving Swiss Bank UBS, a prior client.
But Green said he could not recall a case where agents were told to take no further action on a matter involving an incoming attorney general’s former client without some kind of explanation. “Why would you just stop?” he asked.
A source familiar with the progress of the investigation, which is being conducted out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of Illinois, said that since December 2018, “it’s slowed, it’s stalled, it’s languishing. Not a lot of action is being taken.” But the source stressed the probe is not technically closed, and couldn’t be called “dead.”
The government’s questions about Caterpillar’s tax structure started with a whistleblower lawsuit in 2009 that laid out what it said was a complex “tax dodge” to route Caterpillar profits on parts sales through a company in Switzerland. Then, in 2014, the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations dug into the issue, and alleged the company adopted a sales strategy that “shifted billions of dollars in profits away from the United States and into Switzerland, where Caterpillar had negotiated an effective corporate tax rate of 4% to 6%.” The Senate investigators quoted company insiders who said the system was structured for “tax avoidance.”
At the time, Caterpillar said the transactions, and tax strategy, were entirely legal. A Caterpillar vice president testified to the committee that having an offshore subsidiary collect profits and pay taxes was “nothing more than the standard business operations and tax planning that any prudent multinational enterprise would employ.”
The next year, a federal grand jury in Illinois launched a criminal investigation. In March 2017, federal agents raided three Caterpillar offices, wheeling out evidence in large black plastic boxes. In a report written for the government, a consultant for the investigators, Leslie Robinson, called the tax strategy “fraudulent rather than negligent.”
Two weeks after the raid, Caterpillar Chief Executive Jim Umpleby announced the hiring of Barr as company counsel. Barr would “take a fresh look at Caterpillar’s disputes with the government, get all the facts, and then help us bring these matters to proper resolution based on the merits.”
Robinson, the investigative consultant who had questioned Caterpillar’s tactics, told Reuters she met with Barr in May 2017, briefing him on why she thought the tax strategy was illegal, and to hear why the company thought it was not. Robinson said she would not discuss the meeting details or the basis for her conclusion in the government’s report.
In November 2018, as the White House scanned potential lawyers to take the job of attorney general, Barr’s name was among those floated. On December 7, the White House announced his selection. “He was my first choice from day one,” Trump said. Barr has emerged as one of Trump’s most aggressive aides, most recently authorizing federal prosecutors to investigate the counting of votes in this month’s presidential election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.
In January 2019, Robinson, a professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business, sent a note to FDIC agent LeBeau asking if the case was “dead or progressing.” Robinson wrote, “From a personal standpoint, it is a bit peculiar to have spent so much of my time and energy on something and then to have no idea if it will amount to anything concrete.”
“Quite frankly I am somewhat in the dark as well,” LeBeau replied. He said he had understood that a new U.S. attorney was in discussions with Caterpillar, but knew little more. “I know the process is going incredibly slow.”
This October, Robinson communicated again with the investigators. In emails reviewed by Reuters, she asked what had happened to the case, explaining that a Reuters reporter had inquired. That’s when LeBeau explained, copying other agents and a prosecutor on the email, that they had been told to take no further action a week after Barr’s nomination 20 months ago.

“We were given no additional explanation,” he wrote.

NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday granted a U.S. government request to drop drug charges against former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos and return him to Mexico, a move Mexico said would restore trust in the countries' severely strained security cooperation ties. 
The dismissal came one day after a surprise announcement by U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Mexican Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero that the U.S. case would end, just one month after being announced.
""Although these are very serious charges against a very significant figure, and the old adage 'a bird in the hand' comes to mind, I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the government's decision,"" U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon said at a hearing in Brooklyn, New York.
Cienfuegos, 72, was Mexico's defense minister from 2012 to 2018 under former President Enrique Pena Nieto.
His arrest shook Mexico's security establishment, where Cienfuegos has maintained close ties, and prompted President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government to threaten a review of agreements letting U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents operate in the country.
Seth DuCharme, the Acting U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, said his office ""stands behind its case"" against Cienfuegos but that the ""broader interest"" in maintaining cooperation between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement was more important.
Wednesday's dismissal was without prejudice, meaning the U.S. government could charge Cienfuegos again. Mexico said its own case so far was based solely on evidence provided by the United States.
Speaking in Spanish, Cienfuegos told the judge he agreed to be moved to Mexico and did not expect to face persecution there.
His lawyer Edward Sapone said he expected the retired army general to be returned to Mexico on Wednesday, and later to his family.
""Today is a day of justice, because today there are no charges against him, either here or in Mexico,"" Sapone told reporters after the hearing. 
Mike Vigil, a former DEA chief of international operations, said the dismissal sent ""shockwaves"" through that agency, where he remains in contact.
He also expressed skepticism Mexico would prosecute Cienfuegos, and suggested the dismissal was a ""gift"" from U.S. President Donald Trump to reward Lopez Obrador for not recognizing Joe Biden as U.S. president-elect.
'SLAP IN THE FACE'
Cienfuegos' arrest, at Los Angeles International Airport, made him the first Mexican former military chief taken into U.S. custody for drug-related crime in Mexico.
While in office, Cienfuegos had worked closely with U.S. authorities and become a leading Mexican figure fighting that country's drug war.
But U.S. prosecutors said Cienfuegos abused the power of his office to protect a faction of the Beltran-Leyva cartel, while ordering operations against rival gangs.
Cienfuegos had pleaded not guilty to drug and money laundering conspiracy charges.
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Cienfuegos' arrest damaged the trust needed for cooperation to fight drug gangs, though Wednesday's dismissal could help ease tensions.
""You can't have close cooperation with all of Mexico's institutions, and do this at the same time,"" Ebrard said. ""You have to choose."" 
Cienfuegos' arrest came without warning to Mexico, and set off a flurry of frantic calls between Barr, DEA Acting Administrator Timothy Shea and Mexican officials.
David Shirk, global fellow for the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, called the dismissal a ""slap in the face"" to many in U.S. law enforcement.
""A lot of people probably put their lives on the line to bring Cienfuegos to justice,"" he said. ""The dismissal sends a message to law enforcement and organized crime groups that the U.S. government is not serious about its commitment to the war on drugs.""
Cienfuegos' arrest came 10 months after U.S. prosecutors charged Mexico's former top public security chief, Genaro Garcia Luna, with taking bribes to protect the Sinaloa drug cartel once run by drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

Garcia Luna has pleaded not guilty.

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, sought advice from two senior members of the royal family before writing a letter to her father which is at the centre of a privacy lawsuit against a tabloid newspaper, court documents show.
Meghan, the wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing Associated Newspapers over articles in the Mail on Sunday that included parts of the handwritten letter she had sent to her estranged father Thomas Markle in August 2018.
She says the publication of the letter was a misuse of private information and breached her copyright, and her lawyers are seeking aggravated damages.
Meghan and her father have not spoken since he pulled out days before her wedding to Harry in May 2018 because of ill health but subsequently gave a number of media interviews.
In her latest submission to London's High Court, her legal team rejected the Mail's claim that the letter was part of a media strategy, but that it followed ""advice from two senior members of the Royal Family"" on how to get her father to stop talking to the press, her lawyers said.
Meghan created a draft on her iPhone over several weeks, sharing it with Harry and her ""trusted"" Communications Secretary Jason Knauf, who gave general feedback but no actual wording, the document said.
""The Claimant, and the Claimant alone, created the Electronic Draft, which she then transcribed by hand to her father as the Letter,"" said her lawyers, adding Meghan had been following palace protocol. 
Her lawyers did disclose Meghan had allowed some information to be passed via a third party to authors of a biography of the couple because she was concerned about ""her father's narrative"" and wanted ""the true position"" to be communicated.
In September, the court ruled the Mail could amend its case to include details from the recently published biography ""Finding Freedom"".
The paper's lawyers argue the book showed Meghan intended some private details to become public, including the letter, as part of a media campaign to portray her in a positive light.
But, Meghan's legal team repeated their position that neither she nor Harry had cooperated or been interviewed for the book.
The case has raised the possibility of Markle giving evidence against his daughter in court. However, in a ruling earlier on Wednesday, the judge Mark Warby said Markle did not appear to be an important witness in the case and it was inaccurate to view it as a family battle.

Last month, Warby granted a request from Meghan's legal team to delay the trial from January until late 2021 because of a ""confidential"" reason.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Bahrain and Israel said on Wednesday they would open embassies, establish online visa systems and launch weekly flights between the countries soon, in a broadened cooperation promoted by Washington as an economic boon and means of isolating Iran. 
On the first official visit by Bahraini officials to Israel, the Gulf kingdom's foreign minister, Abdullatif Al-Zayani, said a Sept. 15 deal normalising relations spelled ""a warm peace that will deliver clear benefits to our peoples"". 
The United Arab Emirates, which has also normalised ties with Israel, sent a delegation last month that did not leave Ben Gurion Airport in what was described as a coronavirus precaution.
The Bahraini envoys went on to Jerusalem, which Israel, with U.S. backing, considers its capital. Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem for a state, have been outraged by the Arab countries' engagement with Israel while their own goals are unmet.
In a possible sign of a rethink, a senior Palestinian official told Reuters that Palestinian ambassadors would return to Abu Dhabi and Manama after having been recalled in protest. 
Al-Zayani's trip coincided with a visit to Israel by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who hailed the regional rapprochement brokered by the Trump administration as it presses sanctions against Iran. 
The normalisation deals ""tell malign actors like the Islamic Republic of Iran that their influence in the region is waning and that they are ever more isolated and shall forever be until they change their direction,"" Pompeo said alongside his Bahraini counterpart and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Al-Zayani announced that, as of Dec. 1, Bahrainis and Israelis will be able to apply online for entry visas. He also submitted a request to open a Bahraini embassy in Israel and said an Israeli embassy had been approved for Manama.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Askenazi, who is due to visit Manama next month, said he hoped opening ceremonies for the embassies would be held by the end of 2020. 
The Bahraini delegation travelled on Gulf Air flight GF972 - a reference to Israel's telephone country code - in what was the airline's first flight to Tel Aviv. Al-Zayani predicted 14 such flights weekly starting next year, as well as flights to the smaller Israeli destinations of Haifa and Eilat. 
Sudan followed Bahrain and UAE in announcing last month it would move towards ties with Israel. Further such developments appear unlikely before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office. Israel was due to send a first delegation to Sudan on Sunday, officials told Reuters, but the trip was postponed over what they described as logistical issues. 

Speaking on Israel's Army Radio, Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen said a commitment towards a tough policy on Iran by Biden would determine whether other countries would opt for normalisation deals with Israel.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia predicted swift victory but northern rebels promised them ""hell"" on Wednesday in a two-week war threatening the vast nation's unity and further destabilising the Horn of Africa.
The war has killed hundreds, sent 30,000 refugees into Sudan, and called into question whether Africa's youngest leader can hold together Ethiopia's myriad fractious ethnic groups.
Rebuffing appeals for talks, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government says its forces are marching on Tigray's capital Mekelle and will soon triumph over the local ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which he accuses of revolt.
The rebels say they have captured tanks and artillery and held off the offensive despite being massively outnumbered.
""Tigray is now a hell to its enemies,"" they said in a statement.
The TPLF says Abiy, their ex-military comrade and one-time political partner, has removed Tigrayans from senior security and government posts since he took office in 2018 and now wants to dominate them completely. 
Abiy's government has put former officials - many Tigrayan - on trial for crimes like torture, murder and corruption, but denies any attempt at ethnic domination.
""The federal government... denounces, in the strongest of terms, mischaracterization that this operation has an ethnic or other bias,"" the government said.
Debretsion Gebremichael, elected Tigrayan president in polls that Ethiopia does not recognise, told Reuters by text that his forces had fallen back but denied government allegations they destroyed bridges and a road leading to the capital.
""We have shifted our defence line and as a result they get into some towns of South Tigray,"" he added.
Ethiopian federal forces are trying to advance along long main roads from the south and the northwest of Mekelle and had got within around 200 km (124 miles) of the Tigrayan capital, a diplomat monitoring the conflict said.
The Tigrayan leaders accused federal forces of targeting civilians, churches and homes. The government says it is only hitting TPLF targets and has accused Tigrayan forces of using civilians as human shields.
Map of region: https://graphics.reuters.com/ETHIOPIA-CONFLICT/yzdvxkyewpx/ethiopia-tigray-conflict.jpg 
CUT OFF
The northern state is largely cut off as media are barred, most communications are down and aid workers are pulling out, meaning Reuters could not verify assertions from either side.
Hundreds of thousands have been uprooted from homes, while internet, electricity and banking services have been blocked.
Some refugees have said militias from Amhara, the neighbouring state, attacked them because of ethnicity. There have also been reports of Tigrayans losing jobs and facing discrimination elsewhere.
Abiy's government has repeatedly denied an ethnic undertone, saying it is pursuing criminals and guaranteeing national unity. 
Aiby's parents are from the Oromo and Amharic ethnic groups - the largest and second largest respectively.
Tigrayans represent about 5% of the 115 million people in Africa's second most populous country.
They dominated national leadership before Abiy took the premiership and began opening up the economy and a repressive political system that had jailed tens of thousands of political prisoners.
Now 44, he won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for a pact with Eritrea. In a rare comment on activities of a laureate, the Nobel committee in Oslo expressed deep concern this week and urged peaceful resolution of the Tigray conflict.
'DEVASTATING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS'
The TPLF has also fired rockets into neighbouring Eritrea, escalating the war beyond national borders. It has a long-standing enmity with President Isaias Afwerki's government, which has denied sending troops into Tigray against the rebels.
Ethiopia's army is one of Africa's strongest, but many officers were Tigrayan and much of its heavy weaponry was based in Tigray, on the front line of the standoff with Eritrea after a 1998-2000 war. 
The Tigrayans are also a battle-hardened force with experience of fighting against Eritrea and spearheading the ouster of a Marxist dictatorship in 1991.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said healthcare facilities in Tigray and Amhara were short of supplies and assistance for many wounded.
""We are seeing a devastating humanitarian crisis unfold,"" ICRC delegation head Katia Sorin said, adding that a telecommunications blackout was distressing families.
One hospital in the city of Gondar in Amhara had treated more than 400 people injured in the conflict while also handling 14 COVID-19 patients, the ICRC said. Three Ethiopia Red Cross ambulances were attacked last week.
With ramifications of the conflict all over the region, Ethiopian peacekeepers helping curb Islamist militants in Somalia removed weapons from 200-300 of their Tigrayan soldier colleagues in the past week, four sources told Reuters. 
That was due to concerns over loyalty, not their ethnicity, the government said.
Ethiopia dispatched its foreign minister on a regional tour this week to explain the need for its Tigray offensive, which Addis Ababa has termed ""law enforcement"". 
Two diplomats briefed on the meetings said regional leaders told him talks would be needed to stop the security and humanitarian crisis spilling over more borders if fighting persisted. 

Trying to tighten its squeeze, Ethiopia issued arrest warrants for 76 senior military officers on treason charges for their links to Tigrayan leaders, state-affiliated Fana TV said.

The ruling, concerning Igor Tuleya, a judge in a district court in Warsaw, came as a long-running conflict over judicial independence resulted in Poland and Hungary blocking the EU's 2021-2027 budget and recovery fund over a clause making access to money conditional on respecting the rule of law.
Tuleya told reporters in front of Poland's Supreme Court before the verdict that he was not afraid and would continue to work.
""If my immunity is lifted, I will not appear before the prosecutor, he will have to take me by force,"" he said. ""I will come to work... try to act as a judge.""
Earlier this year, the European Court of Justice ruled that Poland's government should suspend the Supreme Court's disciplinary chamber as it was not sufficiently independent.
While not the first judge critical of the government to lose his immunity, Tuleya is the first to lose it as a result of his actions in the courtroom, according to Polish judges association Iustitia.
He is facing disciplinary proceedings after he allowed media access to a sensitive court ruling in 2017 regarding a parliamentary vote on the budget criticised for not having opposition politicians present.
The government has justified its far-reaching reforms - including how judges are appointed - by saying they are necessary to improve the efficiency of the courts and to root out the vestiges of the 1945-89 communist era.
The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has aimed to prevent judges from ruling that peers nominated by a panel set up under new rules drawn up by parliament are not independent.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Vaccinating 20% of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean against COVID-19 will cost more than $2 billion but low income countries will be helped by the COVAX Facility led by the World Health Organization, its regional branch said on Wednesday.
According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), COVAX aims to deploy at least 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.
""This is a remarkable figure. But we also know that it won’t be sufficient to vaccinate everyone, at least not at first,"" , PAHO Assistant Director Jarbas Barbosa said.
PAHO is working to ensure every nation in the region that is interested will have access to the COVAX Facility, a coalition that aims to provide equitable access to eventual COVID-19 vaccines.
Self-financing countries in the Americas participating in COVAX will have the option to purchase the vaccines through PAHO's Revolving Fund, which will speed up their access, he said in a remote briefing from Washington.
So far, 28 self-financing countries have signed agreements with the COVAX Facility, and an additional 10 countries are eligible for support under the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, Barbosa said.
PAHO and UNICEF last week started the purchasing process by inviting COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers around the world to become suppliers for the 186 countries that have joined COVAX.
With countries in the Americas fearing a second wave of coronavirus, the region reported nearly 1.5 million cases and 19,000 deaths due to COVID-19 in last week, PAHO said.
The United States continues to see an acceleration of cases, reporting more than 1 million new infections in the past week alone, Barbosa said.
Brazil is experiencing a new increase in cases and deaths, and Uruguay has seen spikes in areas bordering Brazil, he said.

Cases have decreased in most Andean countries and Argentina continues to see a sharp decrease, according to PAHO.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A one-time officer in the elite U.S. Green Beret special forces unit has pleaded guilty to charges he conspired to provide American defense secrets to Russian spies, U.S. prosecutors said on Wednesday.
Federal prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia, said that former Green Beret captain Peter Rafael Dzibinski Debbins, 45, a Minnesota native whose mother was born in Russia, conspired over 14 years to provide agents of an unspecified Russian spy service with U.S. defense information.
Sentencing was set for Feb. 26, 2021, according to the court docket.
Prosecutors said that from 1998 to 2005, Debbins was on active duty as an officer in the U.S. Army, serving first in chemical defense units and later in the elite U.S. Army Special Forces unit known as the Green Berets. 
Russian intelligence agents encouraged him to join and pursue a Special Forces career, where he served as a captain, prosecutors said. Lawyers for Debbins did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
A statement of facts filed by both prosecutors and the defendant said Debbins first developed an interest in Russia due to his mother's heritage and first visited the country aged 19.
The statement says that during one of his early visits to Chelyabinsk, a Russian city with a nearby air base, Debbins met his wife, whose father was a Russian military officer. The document says Debbins began meeting with Russian intelligence officers while visiting Russia in 1996, while he was still participating in the ROTC military training program at his U.S. university.
Prosecutors said that over time, Debbins provided Russian spies with information about the chemical and Special Forces units where he served. In 2008, after leaving active duty service, Debbins gave the Russians classified information about his previous activities while deployed with the Special Forces, and about former special forces colleagues, prosecutors said.

Announcements over the last two weeks that two vaccines were effective in trials have raised hope that COVID-19, which has infected 54 million people worldwide and killed 1.3 million, will be largely defeated over the coming year.
Greece has seen an aggressive spike in novel coronavirus cases since early October that forced it to impose a nationwide lockdown, the second since the pandemic broke out. 
""Just a little bit more patience, let's hang on together, united,"" Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias said as he detailed the country's immunization programme.
Greece will get vaccine doses under an EU plan. The country expects the first deliveries in early 2021, the government has said. 
Kikilias said about two million Greeks will be vaccinated monthly once Greece gets the shots. Doctors, nurses and medical staff will have a priority, while those aged above 65 years will follow. 
The health system is still under enormous pressure despite the three-week lockdown, which officially ends at the end of November, Kikilias said. 

Greece registered 3,209 new cases on Thursday and 60 deaths, its second highest record. The latest figure brings the total in the country to 82,034 infections since the first case surfaced in February and the death toll to 1,288.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. district court judge on Wednesday blocked expulsions of unaccompanied children caught crossing into the United States, a setback for the outgoing Trump administration, which said the policy was aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in the District of Columbia ruled that the minors were likely to suffer irreparable harm because they could be subject to sexual abuse and other violence, as well as face the possibility of torture and death if summarily returned to their home countries.
President Donald Trump has made immigration curbs a central part of his four-year term in office and enacted a series of sweeping immigration restrictions during the pandemic.
President-elect Joe Biden, who defeated Trump earlier this month and takes office on Jan. 20, has vowed to reverse many of the Republican president's hard-line immigration policies.
Biden has not yet commented on how he would handle the emergency border rules that allow for rapid deportations. A Biden campaign official told Reuters that he would defer to health experts on such restrictions.
A U.S. Border Patrol official said in a September court filing that 8,800 unaccompanied minors were expelled under the border rules between their enactment on March 20 and Sept. 9.
Overall, the United States has expelled roughly 197,000 migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border from March through the end of September, though those figures include migrants who may have crossed multiple times.
Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represented plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said the policy was a ""pretext"" for Trump to close the border to children and asylum seekers from Central America.

The U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew attention to the Turqazabad site in Tehran in a speech to the United Nations in September 2018, urging the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit it. Iran called it a carpet-cleaning facility. 
IAEA inspectors went there in February 2019 and took environmental samples that showed traces of processed uranium. The Vienna-based U.N. watchdog has been seeking answers on where those traces came from ever since; it says only part of Iran's explanations have held water.
""We believe they need to give us information which is credible. What they are telling us from a technical point of view doesn't add up, so they need to clarify this,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told a news conference during a quarterly meeting of his agency's 35-nation Board of Governors.
The IAEA and U.S. intelligence services have long believed Iran had a coordinated, clandestine nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers effectively drew a line under much of its past.
Irrespective of the deal, however, the IAEA is in charge of accounting for all nuclear material in countries that have ratified the global Non-Proliferation Treaty to ensure none is being diverted to make nuclear weapons, even if evidence of previously unknown material is many years old.
Israel has said it seized part of an Iranian ""archive"" of its past nuclear work, and has used that to call attention to Iranian activities long predating the 2015 deal.
Iran has objected to use of that archive material, denouncing ""attempts to open an endless process of verifying and cleaning-up of ever-continuing fabricated allegations"". It says it has never sought to weaponise nuclear energy.
An IAEA report last week said further analysis of the Turqazabad samples found ""isotopically altered particles of low enriched uranium"". Similar particles were found in Iran in the past, linked to secretly imported centrifuge components originally from Pakistan, it added.

""Whatever nuclear material left such traces was very likely enriched or irradiated,"" the United States said in its statement to the board. ""This raises a whole new series of questions about where such material came from and what Iran may still be hiding. It should be of the utmost concern to all Board members.""

LONDON (Reuters) - English doctors are grappling with the prospect of seven-day service, -75 degree Celsius freezers and vaccines known as ""Talent"" and ""Courageous"" as they prepare for an unprecedented logistical challenge: the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations.
Health minister Matt Hancock has set a target for England's National Health Service that it should be ready to administer vaccines by Dec. 1, although he has said his central expectation is for the bulk of the roll-out to happen next year.
Any distribution of vaccines would also require approval from the country's medical watchdog, the MHRA.
On Wednesday, NHS England medical director Stephen Powis confirmed that general practitioners (GPs), pharmacies and large-scale inoculation centres could all be involved in the vaccine roll-out, adding more details would be given in the coming days.
""There's going to be some nationally organised vaccine immunisation centres, which will be large centres, probably run with military involved, etc. But GPs are well placed,"" Steve Mowle, a practising GP and honorary treasurer of the Royal College of General Practitioners, told Reuters.
""The challenge of this task is even bigger than the flu immunisation programme. But I'm sure that GPs will have a very central role in delivering the COVID-19 vaccine.""
Germany is scouting trade fair halls and airport terminals as possible mass vaccination centres, while Italy plans to lean on its existing GP network. But in many countries, details of how the population will be inoculated are scarce.
A spokesman for Britain's health ministry said that extra logistical expertise, transport arrangements and equipment had been put in place, the workforce had been expanded and 150 million pounds had been given to GP practices.
""An enormous amount of planning has taken place to ensure our health service stands ready to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine,"" he said.
""We will publish further details on our deployment plans in due course.""
'TALENT' AND 'COURAGEOUS' 
Although there is still a lack of clarity over some of the details of how doctors are expected to deliver the vaccines, they have been briefed on the broad outlines.
In the absence of trade names, the NHS uses codenames to refer to the two vaccine candidates that are expected to be the first available.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's vaccine candidate, which uses an mRNA platform, is referred to as ""Courageous vaccine"", while the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN)'s is referred to as ""Talent vaccine"" in slides from a webinar to health professionals given by NHS England last week that have been reviewed by Reuters. 
Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine candidate, which had 95% efficacy in final trial results published on Wednesday, and 100 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot, which is expected to publish efficacy data in coming weeks.
In the webinar, doctors were told there would be 975 doses per pack of Pfizer vaccine, with two doses needed to be given 21 days apart, in line with the U.S. drugmaker's design specifications.
Clinics could also need to be open at weekends to make sure the doses are used in time.
""Potential COVID-19 vaccines could need to be delivered within a certain time period once they arrive at a site,"" the slide said.
""So, if necessary, but not otherwise, practices will need to have the ability to deliver vaccinations between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. seven days a week to avoid any going to waste.""
TWIN TRACK
The urgency of getting vaccines delivered to people promptly after they are received stems in part from the demanding storage requirements of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which needs to be kept at around -75 degrees Celsius.
It can then be stored for five days in refrigeration but once diluted it has to be used within a matter of hours, which causes headaches for those distributing the vaccine, especially in rural areas.
""There's some real challenges around how, how it might be used,"" Richard Vautrey, a doctor and chair of the British Medical Association's GP Committee, said.
""It's quite different from what we would normally experience with, say, the flu vaccine,"" he said, adding that details of the ""twin track"" strategy were under active discussion.
The onerous storage requirements of the Pfizer vaccine can be mitigated by dry ice and other temporary cooling solutions, said Anna Blakney, research fellow at Imperial College London.
""Between the purchase of new freezers and having that space, in addition to the dry ice shipments, that would probably be able to accommodate ... all the vaccines that we'd be receiving,"" she said. 
Much of the delivery of vaccines will be determined at a local level, and exact practices may vary in different parts of England, let alone in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, where health policy is devolved.
In the central English county of Nottinghamshire, health officials said in a briefing to medical professionals that they planned to be ready to start vaccinating front-line staff and people in care homes from Dec. 9, with large-scale COVID vaccine centres operating from Jan. 2 and more GP practice involvement from mid-January. 
""I don't think we'll be at full capacity from the first of December. Obviously, we will have a gradual roll-out,"" Mowle said.

""But... where there's a will there's a way, and I think there's a huge willingness of GPs to engage in this process.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia said on Wednesday peacekeepers from its Tigray region serving in Somalia had been disarmed over a security issue, raising concerns over the forces' ability to fight al Qaeda-linked militants.
Diplomatic and security sources said earlier that between 200 and 300 Tigrayans had had their weapons removed.
Ethiopian troops began fighting forces from the northern region of Tigray earlier this month after what the government described as a surprise attack by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) on colleagues stationed there.
Ethiopia’s military, which is regarded as the most effective in the Horn of Africa, plays a big role in an African Union (AU) peacekeeping force in Somalia and has also sent troops bilaterally.
The disarmament of some of those troops could weaken the forces' ability to fight the Islamist al Shabaab insurgency as Somalia prepares to hold parliamentary elections next month and presidential elections in February, experts say. U.S. President Donald Trump is also considering pulling out hundreds of U.S. troops before January. 
""What do you do when you're a force commander and you find you have 200 or 300 soldiers who can't go into battle because of their ethnicity?"" a security source told Reuters. 
Tigray's leaders have said Ethiopia's government is biased against the region, a charge the government has repeatedly denied.
""The peacekeepers are not being disarmed due to ethnicity but due to infiltration of TPLF elements in various entities which is part of an ongoing investigation,"" said a text message to Reuters from the State of Emergency Taskforce, a body set up to deal with the Tigray conflict. No further information was given.
Earlier, four diplomatic and security sources told Reuters those disarmed included bilateral and AU troops.
The disarmed men were believed to be confined to their bases in Somalia, according to two diplomatic sources. They include a deputy commander in one of the military sectors, the security source said.
The AU peacekeeping force did not respond to calls and messages for comment. 
Ethiopia, which shares a long and porous border with Somalia, contributes around 4,000 of the 17,000 troops under the AU, and has around 15,000 additional soldiers in Somalia bilaterally: that is more than any other nation.
Ethiopia had also withdrawn a small number of troops stationed in Somalia bilaterally, three sources told Reuters, but had decided against large-scale withdrawals. The government did not respond to requests for comment on the assertion. Last week, a spokesman for the taskforce said the offensive in Tigray would not lead Ethiopia to withdraw peacekeepers abroad.
It was not clear whether the soldiers reportedly pulled out were Tigrayan or other troops destined for possible redeployment on the government side in Tigray.
Earlier this month, the African Union fired its security head Gebreegziabher Mebratu Melese, a Tigrayan, after Ethiopia's defence ministry expressed concerns about him.
U.S. troops have already withdrawn from two bases in Somalia last month, and Trump is mulling pulling out most of the rest.
Many of the 700 or so U.S. forces in Somalia train and support Danab, the Somali special forces trained to hunt and kill senior leaders in the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency. 
Al Shabaab has carried out deadly attacks on civilians throughout the East African region, including an attack on a U.S. military base in Kenya that killed three Americans earlier this year. Danab, which is around 850 soldiers currently but planned to grow to around 3,000, is Somalia's most effective fighting force.

LONDON (Reuters) - The BBC said on Wednesday it had appointed a former senior judge to head an inquiry into how the broadcaster secured a famous 1995 interview with the late Princess Diana, after accusations from her brother that she had been tricked into taking part.
This month, her brother Charles Spencer said the BBC had failed to apologise for what he said were forged documents and ""other deceit"" which led him to introduce Diana to journalist Martin Bashir.
During her interview with Bashir, watched by more than 20 million viewers in Britain, Diana shocked the nation by admitting to an affair and giving intimate details of her failed marriage to heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles.
The BBC's Director General Tim Davie said the broadcaster was determined to get to the truth about Spencer's claims.
""This is an important investigation which I will start straight away,"" said John Dyson, the former Supreme Court justice appointed to lead the inquiry. ""I will ensure it is both thorough and fair.""
Spencer says Bashir made a series of allegations to himself and his sister such as that Diana was being bugged by the security services and that two senior aides were being paid to provide information about her. He says Bashir provided fake bank statements to back up the claim.
Others involved in making the programme have also come forward to say the BBC had covered up wrongdoing.
Bashir has made no public comment to media and the BBC says the journalist, who gained global renown from the Diana interview and is currently the corporation's religious affairs correspondent, is currently on sick leave, recovering from heart surgery and from contracting COVID-19.
The BBC said its investigation would examine five questions such as what steps the BBC and Bashir took to obtain the interview, ""including (i) the mocked-up bank statements purporting to show payments to a former employee of Earl Spencer (ii) the purported payments to members of the royal households and (iii) the other matters recently raised by Earl Spencer.""

Two days earlier, the 19-year-old had left his native Morocco on a rickety boat and embarked on a dangerous journey to reach the Canary Islands archipelago, around 100 km (60 miles) away.
Like a record number of other migrants this year, he was seeking a better future in Europe.
Bettache, who is 27 and lives in France where she has citizenship, had no warning of her brother's drastic action, and nor did the rest of the family.
""We were shocked. First we thought he had gone on holiday with his colleagues, because his phone was not charged,"" she told Reuters.
After learning of her brother's fate, she travelled last week to Gran Canaria and embarked on a frantic search to find him.
She said she was told it would be impossible, and their mother became so fraught that she was hospitalised.
""She was so worried. We had no information about him, we didn't know if he was alive,"" Bettache recalled.
Finally, an official from the Red Cross was able to locate Ahmed, aided by a picture Bettache gave her. After a long wait, the Red Cross worker returned with a photograph she had taken with her phone of Ahmed, who was at a migrant camp.
""I was so happy,"" said Bettache.
On Monday night, she was finally able to see her brother, but only from about 100 metres away because he was being held in a dockside camp for migrants at Arguineguin harbour. She could only cry and shout.
The facility was set up months ago to cope with a rise in the number of migrants landing there, and was designed as a holding camp before they were moved elsewhere.
But it became overcrowded, and some migrants were forced to sleep in the open as the island struggled to cope with the number of arrivals.
""I can't explain how I felt in words,"" Bettache added later. 
On Tuesday, Ahmed was released from the camp and the siblings stayed at an apartment Sarah had rented.

They hope to travel on to mainland Europe together, although Ahmed may struggle if he does not have the correct documents. The Spanish government delegation in the Canaries did not respond to requests for comment on whether such a trip would be possible.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai police have water cannon and teargas to fire at protesters. The answer: Inflatable yellow pool ducks.
The giant ducks starred on Wednesday as thousands of protesters massed outside police headquarters in Bangkok.
They had first made an appearance on Tuesday outside parliament in the most violent day of months of demonstrations as protesters used them as shields to advance towards police lines.
""They're like a mascot now. I saw them being used as shields. Maybe they are not that strong but they are a good stunt,"" said a 27-year-old protester named Earn as she posed for a photo with three of the ducks.
One protester said the ducks had originally been bought for fun, but were used as impromptu shields when police used water cannon.
""If the police hadn't fired water cannon at us, we wouldn't have had to use them as a shield,"" said one protester who gave her name as Wim.
Police did not respond immediately to a request for comment on use of the ducks. Police did not use water cannon or teargas on Wednesday as protesters sprayed water and splashed paint at police headquarters.
Similar ducks were offered for around 2,800 baht ($90) each by several suppliers on Lazada, a popular online shopping site in Thailand.
Protests began in July and seek the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha - a former junta leader, changes to the constitution and curbs on the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.

""Long Live the King,"" protesters shouted sardonically at the convoy of ducks borne head high at Wednesday's protest.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of Thai protesters took to the streets of Bangkok on Wednesday despite the worst violence in months of demonstrations the day before, when police fired water cannon and tear gas and at least 55 people were hurt.
Youth-led protests since July have become the biggest challenge to the establishment in years with their demands for the ousting of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a new constitution and reforms to curb the monarchy's powers.
""We will resist peacefully,"" Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul told the protest in central Bangkok. ""The use of force on people and youths is not acceptable.""
In parliament, where lawmakers voted on seven options for ways to change the constitution, a proposal that would have opened the way for discussion of the monarchy's role failed to win enough votes for approval.
Two proposals were adopted that would allow for discussion of constitutional change without affecting the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
""We will not touch on that,"" said Wirat Ratanaset, from the ruling coalition.
The vote was not a surprise. Prayuth's supporters have a majority in the parliament, where the entire upper house Senate was appointed by the junta he led after a 2014 coup until a disputed election last year.
Protesters battled their way to the gates of parliament on Tuesday, after police repeatedly used tear gas and water cannon to try to push them back. Protesters also scuffled with yellow-shirted royalist counter-protesters.
Bangkok's Erawan Medical Centre said at least 55 people were hurt, with 32 suffering from tear gas and six with gunshot wounds. Police said they had confirmed two gunshot wounds and were investigating further.
Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters the government was sorry people were hurt and wanted protests to remain peaceful.

There was no immediate sign of trouble on Wednesday, but protesters brought along the inflatable pool ducks that they have used as shields against police water cannon and tear gas. Police said more than 6,000 people were at the protest.

The country bore the brunt of a large influx of refugees and migrants into Europe in 2015 and 2016, many arriving via its outlying Aegean islands close to Turkey. 
The flow has since ebbed significantly, though more than 90,000 migrants remain in Greece, of which about 19,000 live in filthy temporary camps, some for months or years.
Authorities will have finished the construction of better-equipped camps on the islands of Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Leros and Kos by the autumn of 2021, Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said. None of the asylum seekers would be on an island for more than six months.
""In 12 months from today we should not have any of the legacy reception system we are seeing today,"" Mitarachi told a news conference called to present the country's migration strategy over the next two years. 
Authorities were restructuring the asylum service to introduce remote and digital applications in order to faster process a backlog of about 87,000 asylum requests, he said.
In September, a fire razed Greece's largest migrant camp on Lesbos, leaving about 12,000 people stranded. Most of them have now been moved to a temporary tent camp.

The conservative New Democracy government, elected in July 2019, has taken a tougher stance towards migration than its left-wing predecessors. It has placed limits on an appeals process which previously took months or years to navigate.

""It remains very important for us not to jeopardize what we have reached so far by taking any rash actions,"" Maas said.
The German government is in touch with Washington and the NATO alliance and is looking into what consequences the U.S. withdrawal would have for the around 1,200 German troops still deployed to Afghanistan as part of a larger NATO mission, he said.

The bombings took place in the crowded Mulberry Bush pub and The Tavern in Birmingham, central England, on Nov. 21, 1974. Although the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was believed to have planted the explosives, it never claimed responsibility.
West Midlands Police said counter-terrorism officers had arrested a 65-year-old man at his home in Belfast on Wednesday in connection with the attacks. 
""The man was arrested under the Terrorism Act and a search of his home is being carried out,"" they said in a statement. ""He will be interviewed under caution at a police station in Northern Ireland.""
The bombings, in which over 180 people were also wounded, caused the biggest loss of life on the British mainland during the 30 years of conflict between mostly Catholic nationalists, who favored Northern Ireland’s unification with the Republic of Ireland, and Protestants wanting to stay in the United Kingdom.
The violence, known as “The Troubles” in which some 3,600 people died, was largely brought to an end with the 1998 Good Friday agreement.
In one of Britain’s most notorious miscarriages of justice, six Irish men were later wrongly convicted of the bombings and spent 16 years in jail until they were exonerated and released in 1991. One of those wrongly jailed said the police had advance knowledge about the attack but allowed it to happen. 
However, an inquest last year concluded the bombs were planted by members of the Provisional IRA, and that a warning they gave was inadequate. It also concluded there was no failing by the police.

ROME (Reuters) - An Italian study supporting the case that the novel coronavirus was circulating outside China earlier than thought has sparked doubts among some Western scientists who called for further tests.
A paper published by the Italian Cancer Institute (INT) describes the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood taken from healthy patients in Italy in October last year during a lung cancer screening trial.
If the data are correct, they would change the history of the pandemic and raise questions of when and where the virus emerged. It was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December.
But several scientists interviewed by Reuters said further examination was needed.
""These results are worth reporting, but mostly should be taken as something to follow up with further testing,"" said Mark Pagel, professor at the School of Biological Sciences at Britain's University of Reading.
""All of the patients in the study were asymptomatic despite most being 55-65 years old and having been smokers. This would normally be a high-risk group for COVID-19, so it is puzzling why all patients were asymptomatic.""
A co-author of the study said he and his colleagues were planning further investigations and called for scientists worldwide to contribute.
The World Health Organization has said the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the respiratory disease it causes, were unknown before the Wuhan outbreak was reported. But it has said the possibility that the virus may have ""silently circulated elsewhere"" cannot be ruled out.
There have been at least 55,573,000 reported infections and 1,336,000 reported deaths caused by COVID-19 globally since the virus was first detected in China.
'UNEXPECTED DETECTION'
China believes the Italian study shows that tracing the origin of the virus is an ongoing process that may involve many countries.
""China will continue working with the rest of the international community to contribute to the global cooperation on fighting COVID-19 and other viruses,"", Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday.
Italy's first COVID-19 patient was detected on Feb. 21 in a small town near Milan, in the northern region of Lombardy. But the Italian researchers' findings show 11.6% of 959 healthy volunteers enrolled in the cancer screening trial between September 2019 and March 2020 had signs of having already encountered the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, most of them well before February.
A further SARS-CoV-2 antibodies test was carried out by the University of Siena for the same research paper, called ""Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the pre-pandemic period in Italy"".
It showed that in six cases, the antibodies were able to kill SARS-CoV-2. Four of the cases dated back to October 2019, meaning the patients had become infected in September.
""This number (six) is fully compatible with test errors and statistical noise. For these reasons, it seems to me that the evidence brought to support such an extraordinary claim is not solid enough,"" said Enrico Bucci, biologist adjunct professor at Philadelphia's Temple University.
""Much ado about nothing,"" Antonella Viola, professor of general pathology at the University of Padua, told Reuters.
'SERIOUS ISSUE INDEED'
Both Italian scientists said the antibody test was in-house designed and never validated by other researchers in a peer review.
What was also noticeable was the very high seroprevalence in the research study's population, they said, referring to the percentage of people who may have been exposed to the virus.
""For there to be an epidemic (albeit apparently asymptomatic) on this scale in Italy a full year before the current pandemic that went unnoticed would be a serious issue indeed,"" said Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds.
Most of the scientists' scepticism focuses on the so called specificity of the antibody tests, that, if not perfect, might reveal the presence of antibodies to other diseases.
""Other recent reports have shown that seasonal coronaviruses can elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies,"" said Jonathan Stoye, group leader at the Francis Crick Institute.
""I think we need a really conclusive demonstration that those samples are picking up the COVID-19 virus and that those antibodies were not actually triggered by another virus,"" Andrew Preston, reader in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath, told Reuters.
Preston said he was surprised that those requirements weren't needed for the publication of a research paper.
""But it is perfectly feasible to go away and do those extra tests and come back and show that,"" he added.
The INT's scientific director and co-author of the study is planning further investigation into the study patients' clinical history.

""We need to understand if they had symptoms of illness. Where they had gone, if they had contact with China,"" Giovanni Apolone told Reuters, calling for colleagues globally to ""open their databases and conduct retrospective researches"".

""I have today informed the Prime Minister that I wish to resign from the Government. I realize that there isn't the necessary support for me among the parliamentary parties,"" Food and Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen said on Twitter. 
The move comes as the government is facing its biggest crisis yet during the pandemic after it illegally ordered the culling of all farmed mink earlier this month to prevent the spread of coronavirus, including a new, mutated strain.
Two weeks ago, authorities drafted the military and police to help Denmark's 1,100 mink farmers cull their 17 million mink, one of the world's biggest herds of the animals, which are bred for their fur.
The government's drastic decision came after health authorities said the mink industry posed a risk to public health in the country due to widespread outbreaks on farms, exacerbated by the find of a mutated virus strain, which it said could compromise the efficacy of future vaccines. 
""It is wise that Mogens Jensen is retiring. There was no other way forward,"" political leader of government ally Socialists People's Party, Pia Olsen Dyhr, said on Twitter.
Opposition parties welcomed Jensen's decision, but redirected their attention towards Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who they say is also accountable, and called for an independent investigation into the government's actions. 
""Mogens Jensen shouldn't take all the heat for a decision that was actually made in the Prime Minister's office. So Mette Frederiksen must take responsibility,"" head of populist Danish People's Party, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, said on Twitter.

The Southeast Asian nation has seen a sharp spike in cases in recent weeks, with the total number of coronavirus infections rising to more than 50,000 cases on Wednesday. 
Sabah, on Borneo island, has been worst-hit by the recent jump, reporting nearly half of the country's infections, most of which were linked to an election held there in September. 
King Al-Sultan Abdullah made the decision to declare a state of emergency in the Batu Sapi constituency on the advice of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and after receiving a briefing by senior government officials, Malaysia's palace said in a statement. 
The king was satisfied that the declaration was necessary ""to curb and prevent a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections"", it said, adding that the polls would be held at a later date. 
The Batu Sapi by-election was originally set to be held on Dec. 5, following the death of a lawmaker last month. 
In a separate televised announcement, Muhyiddin said the emergency declaration was only aimed at stopping the election and assured the public that no additional lockdowns or restrictions on movement would be imposed.
Under Malaysia's constitution, an election must be called within 60 days of a seat being vacated. 
Neither Muhyiddin nor the king stated whether future by-elections could be similarly postponed, after two state and parliamentary lawmakers died in the past week.
National polls could also be triggered if Muhyiddin's coalition, which holds a slim majority in parliament, fails to muster enough votes to pass its budget later this month. Lawmakers are expected to vote on the budget on Nov. 26.

JERUSALEM/AMMAN (Reuters) - Israel launched air raids against what it called a wide range of Syrian and Iranian targets in Syria on Wednesday, sending a signal that it will pursue its policy of striking across the border despite U.S. President Donald Trump's election defeat.
Israel said it was retaliating for what it called an Iranian-sponsored operation in which Syrians planted explosives near an Israeli military base in the occupied Golan Heights.
Israel has frequently attacked what it says are Iranian-linked targets in Syria in recent years, and stepped up such attacks over the past year in what Western intelligence sources describe as a shadow war to reduce Iran's influence.
But Wednesday's attacks struck a far wider range of targets than usual, and the Israeli military was more forthcoming about the details than it has been in the past, suggesting a clear intention to send a public message.
Trump, who lost his re-election bid on Nov. 3, has been a strong backer of Israeli military intervention against Iranian forces in Syria. President-elect Joe Biden has said he will try to revive a nuclear agreement with Iran that Trump abandoned.
The Syrian state news agency reported that three military personnel were killed and one wounded in ""Israeli aggression"".
Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said eight targets were hit, belonging to the Syrian army or Iran's Quds Force, in areas stretching from the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights to the Damascus periphery.
They included an Iranian headquarters at Damascus international airport, a ""secret military site"" that hosted Iranian military delegations, and the 7th Division of the Syrian armed forces, he said. Syrian surface-to-air defences were hit after firing at Israeli planes and missiles, Conricus said.
Western countries say the Quds Force of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards is responsible for supporting Tehran's allies in proxy conflicts across the Middle East.
A former Syrian military commander told Reuters the attacks also targeted a base of the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah in Syria close to the Lebanese border, alongside bases in the southern Damascus area and outposts in the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights where Hezbollah has a presence.
Conricus made no mention of Hezbollah targets.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said at least ten people were killed including five Iranians from the elite Quds Force, as well as at least two Shi'ite militiamen who may have been Lebanese or Iraqi. A commander in an alliance of regional forces backing Damascus denied there were Iranians or Lebanese among the casualties.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has never publicly acknowledged that there are Iranian forces operating on his behalf in Syria's civil war, saying Tehran only has military advisors on the ground.

Western intelligence sources say Israeli strikes this year have undermined Iran's extensive military power in Syria without triggering a major increase in hostilities.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Fresh from the success of creating the world's largest free trade region, China's President Xi Jinping will be among the speakers on Thursday heralding a Asia-Pacific virtual summit that U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to skip.
Last week, 15 countries signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the China-backed accord, which excludes the United States, will loom large over the virtual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) hosted by Malaysia. A dozen of APEC's 21 members signed up to RCEP.
Trump's absence follows his defeat in the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, though he has yet to concede and begin a transfer of government to President-elect Joe Biden.
The one and only APEC summit Trump attended was hosted by Vietnam in 2017. 
The U.S. has yet to name a head of delegation for this summit, though Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun attended an APEC ministerial meeting on Monday.
Malaysian Trade Minister Azmin Ali admitted on Tuesday there were disagreements among member states over the ""level of ambition"" in pursuing APEC's vision and approaches on multilateral trade and economic integration.
Azmin expressed optimism that some consensus could be found, but APEC's recent history has not been encouraging.
Deadly riots forced hosts Chile to cancel last year's summit. And in 2018, APEC failed to agree on a joint communique, the first time in the bloc's history, as the United States and China stood at opposing ends of talks on trade and investments.
Xi and other APEC member leaders are set to speak at a chief executives' conference starting Thursday, ahead of Friday's summit.
A joint ministerial statement on Monday outlined the need for members to uphold free, fair and non-discriminatory trade practices to drive economic recovery from the pandemic, besides implementing structural reforms to promote sustainable and inclusive growth.
But the proposals will need to reach consensus at Friday's summit, with some critics questioning the bloc's relevance.

Georgia, a small South Caucasus country which Washington has traditionally strongly supported, including with military aid, is Pompeo's latest stopover on a multi-country tour. His next stop is Israel.
Pompeo on Wednesday held talks with President Salome Zurabishvili, Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia and Georgian Orthodox Church Patriarch, Ilia II, as well as civil society representatives.
Pompeo told the Georgian prime minister that he recognised ""the pain and difficulty connected to the (Russian) occupation of your country,"" a reference to the fact that Russian forces garrison two breakaway Georgian regions after a 2008 war.

Outside, thousands of people formed a live chain in the city centre holding a huge Georgian national flag and posters saying: ""USA - Thanks for supporting our liberty!"" and ""Elections rigged by Russian oligarch"", referring to Bidzina Ivanishvili, the head of the ruling party, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s.
According to official results of an Oct. 31 parliamentary election, the ruling Georgian Dream party won 48.23% of the vote, with the largest opposition party, the United National Movement (UNM), taking 27.18%.
The opposition accuses Georgian Dream and its supporters of vote buying, of making threats against voters and observers, and of violations during the count. Eight opposition parties, including the UNM, have said they will boycott parliament and are demanding an election re-run. 

Georgian Dream leaders have denied the opposition's accusations, and international observers said that the election had been competitive and that fundamental freedoms had generally been respected.

Pashinyan has rejected calls from opponents and protesters to resign over what they say was his disastrous handling of a six-week conflict between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces over the Nagorno-Karabkh enclave and surrounding areas.
Under a Russian-brokered peace deal, swaths of territory previously controlled by ethnic Armenians are being handed over to Azerbaijan whose forces recaptured chunks of territory which Baku lost in an earlier war in the 1990s.
The Armenian foreign minister resigned earlier this week.
Pashinyan, in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, reiterated on Wednesday that he took full responsibility for what had happened, but said he was now responsible for stabilising Armenia and ensuring its national security. 
""I am completely resolved,"" he wrote, before listing 15 action points he wanted to target. 
He said he wanted to try to restore a formal negotiation process over Nagorno-Karabakh under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk group and to prioritise the return of people to territory still controlled by ethnic Armenians.
That meant helping people restore homes and damaged infrastructure, offering financial help to the families of soldiers killed in the conflict, and caring properly for those who had been wounded.
He said he also wanted to address the legal status of Nagorno Karabakh, carry out military reform, amend election law, and focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and the economy. 

""In June 2021 I will present a report on this road map,"" Pashinyan wrote. ""Public opinion and reaction will be taken into account for deciding future actions"".

The rejection of CTi cable's request is the first time Taiwan has shut, even though indirectly, a television news station since the regulator, the National Communications Commission was set up in 2006. 
The decision provoked immediate anger from CTi and Taiwan's main opposition party, which called it an attack on media freedom. 
Taiwan's government has repeatedly said China has stepped up efforts, including a media campaign, to infiltrate and gain influence on the democratic island, which Beijing considers its own and has threatened to use force to bring under its control.
Commission head Chen Yaw-shyang said the rejection decision was unanimous and cited accusations of interference in CTi's editorial independence by major shareholder Tsai Eng-meng, who runs one of China's largest food firms, Want Want China Holdings Ltd.
""It is a fact that their biggest shareholder had directly interfered in the news desk of CTi,"" Chen said.
CTi had been fined for several violations such as failure to check facts and endangering the public interest, he added.
""The Tsai government has closed CTi; press freedom is dead!"" CTi wrote on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page in response, referring to President Tsai Ing-wen.
The channel, which vowed to fight the decision in court, has denied favouring China, saying the government is seeking to silence those who do not support its policies.
Chen said CTi received more than 920 complaints last year, about a third of the total for all news channels in Taiwan. 
However, he said, there was no evidence that CTi had received Chinese government funding. 
Reuters could not immediately reach key shareholder Tsai to seek comment, but he has previously rejected accusations of newroom interference. 
Tsai's family owns two television stations and several newspapers and cable networks in Taiwan.
The Kuomintang, Taiwan's main opposition party, said it opposed the decision, as it could have a ""chilling effect, strongly impacting press freedom"".

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary vetoed the European Union's 2021-2027 budget and post-coronavirus recovery fund because they would have forced it to accept immigration, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Wednesday. 
Hungary, together with Poland, vetoed both the budget and the recovery plan on Monday, arguing that the budget law included a clause which makes access to money conditional on respecting the rule of law.
Orban is a staunch opponent of mass immigration on the grounds that it dilutes national and European identity. The EU has launched a procedure against Hungary for violating democratic norms.
""After accepting the current proposal there would be no barrier against tying the disbursement of funds to member states to supporting immigration and blackmailing those countries that oppose immigration with budgetary sanctions,"" Orban said in a statement published by state news agency MTI.
The budget and the recovery package do not have any specific clauses about immigration, and political analysts said Orban's comments were aimed at shoring up support among his domestic voters by using anti-immigration rhetoric again. 
DEFENDING BORDERS
Orban said Hungary was committed to the rule of law, but added: ""Those who defend their borders and defend their countries against immigration can no longer be classified as law-abiding in Brussels.""
He added that Hungary had accepted the recovery fund and long-term budget package in July ""because we are committed to European solidarity and support financial aid to the states that need it as quickly as possible"".
The wording on conditionality in the political agreement accompanying the package was watered down on the insistence of Hungary and Poland.
Commenting on Orban's latest statement, Political Capital analyst Patrik Szicherle said: ""This is a political narrative for a domestic audience.
""Since the migration crisis of 2015 Orban has traced any criticism of Hungary's government or (its record on) the rule of law back to a rejection of immigration or George Soros.""

Orban's government has long demonised the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist, accusing him of encouraging mass immigration, something Soros denies. His support for an open liberal society clashes with Orban's nationalist ideology.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken to U.S. President-elect Joe Biden by telephone to congratulate him on his election victory, which he said showed the strength of U.S. democracy, and he vowed to deepen strategic ties.
Modi initially sent his congratulations to Biden in a social media message soon after U.S. television networks projected him to be the winner of the Nov. 3 election even though President Donald Trump has refused to concede defeat.
Modi followed that up with a phone call to congratulate Biden and reaffirm his commitment to a strategic partnership between the two big democracies, Modi said on Twitter late on Tuesday.
""Prime Minister Modi warmly congratulated President-elect Biden on his election, describing it as a testament to the strength and resilience of democratic traditions in the United States,"" the Indian foreign ministry said.
Modi had built close ties with Trump. The two leaders held a joint rally in the U.S. city of Houston last year and again in Modi's home state of Gujarat this year, during a visit to India by Trump.
Modi's critics said the prime minister had come dangerously close to endorsing Trump's candidature, which they said could hurt India's prospects under a Democratic administration.
India and the United States drew closer during Trump's presidency as both countries aimed to counter China's expanding military and economic influence in the region. 
During the telephone call, Modi also extended his best wishes to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, the daughter of an Indian immigrant whose election to the second highest public office in the United States has been cheered in India.

The two leaders also discussed their priorities, including containing the novel coronavirus pandemic, promoting access to affordable vaccines and tackling climate change, the foreign ministry said.

Najib, who is on bail after being sentenced to 12 years in jail in July on charges of corruption and money laundering, is expected to appeal the conviction in February and faces four more trials related to the scandal. 
The U.S. Justice Department has said about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), which Najib co-founded in 2009, including some funds Goldman had helped raise for the firm. 
In a court filing in New York, Najib said Goldman Sachs and its former Southeast Asia chairman, Tim Leissner, probably had evidence that 1MDB officials schemed to defraud the fund and were now falsely implicating him to avoid responsibility. 
Najib added that efforts by Leissner and others to hide the money trail misled him to believe that 1MDB funds that went into his accounts were political donations from the Saudi royal family.
""This effort spanned continents and multiple jurisdictions, included the deployment of an array of shell companies, and involved numerous individuals,"" Najib said in the filing. 
A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Leissner. 
Goldman has agreed to pay more than $5 billion, including a record $2.9 billion in the United States, to settle investigations into its role in underwriting $6.5 billion in bond sales for 1MDB.

Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 2018.

Pro-democracy activists Ted Hui, Ray Chan and Chu Hoi-dick confirmed the arrests on their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pages.
The arrests come after Hong Kong's opposition lawmakers resigned en masse last week in protest against the dismissal of four colleagues in what they see as another push by Beijing to suppress democracy in the city.
Police said that after an in-depth investigation, the three men had been charged with attempting to use harmful substances with the intent to cause harm, mental injury or irritation to others. They have been detained while the investigation continues.
Live television footage showed lawmakers Eddie Chu and Ray Chan rushing to the front of the chamber during a June debate over a controversial bill that would criminalise disrespect of China's national anthem, splashing the reeking fluid as guards grappled with them. Police and firefighters arrived later.
In May, Ted Hui dropped a rotten plant in the middle of the meeting, footage showed.
Hui, who is part of the city's Democratic Party, said on Wednesday that officers came to his home to arrest him after accusing him of disturbing legislature proceedings and mentally disturbing the council's president, Andrew Leung.
Opposition members have tried to take a stand against what many people in the former British colony see as Beijing's whittling away of freedoms, despite a promise of a high degree of autonomy under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, agreed to when it returned to China in 1997.

China denies curbing rights and freedoms in the global financial hub, but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved swiftly to quash dissent after anti-government protests erupted last year and engulfed the city.

MEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors will drop drug charges against ex-Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos and turn over the investigation to Mexico, saying ""sensitive"" foreign policy considerations outweighed the interest in pressing the case.
The surprise decision to dismiss the charges in the politically explosive case was announced in a joint statement on Tuesday from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Mexico's attorney general's office.
""The United States has determined that sensitive and important foreign policy considerations outweigh the government's interest in pursuing the prosecution of the defendant,"" prosecutors from the U.S. Eastern District of New York said in a court document unsealed on Tuesday.
U.S. authorities said the 72-year-old ex-general, accused of using his power to protect a faction of the Beltran-Leyva drugs cartel in Mexico while ordering operations against its rivals, had agreed to voluntarily return to Mexico if the U.S. case against him was thrown out.
Cienfuegos, who served as head of the military and was former President Enrique Pena Nieto's top defense official from 2012 to 2018, pleaded not guilty earlier this month to the drug trafficking and money laundering conspiracy charges following his October arrest in the Los Angeles airport.
After a hearing on Wednesday in a Brooklyn federal court, where the judge is expected to sign off on the prosecutors' request, Cienfuegos will likely be transported back to Mexico in the custody of a U.S. Marshal, the court documents show.
""Tomorrow justice will be done,"" said Edward V. Sapone, Cienfuegos' U.S.-based attorney in a brief statement.
The arrest of Cienfuegos, who for years worked closely with U.S. counterparts on cross-border criminal matters and was a leading figure in Mexico's drug war, put a severe strain on security ties between the two countries. 
The Mexican government was not forewarned of the investigation or arrest, which angered Mexican sensitivities at the highest level. His arrest shocked Mexico's security establishment, given his close ties to a range of current senior officials.
In retaliation, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador publicly threatened to review cooperation agreements that establish how U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents operate in the country.
The threats set off a flurry of frantic calls between U.S. Attorney General Barr, DEA Acting Administrator Timothy Shea, and Mexican officials seeking to calm tensions.
In remarks to reporters shortly after the announcement, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard described the dropping of the U.S. case as unprecedented and a sign of respect for both Mexican sovereignty as well as the Mexican military.
Ebrard said the decision meant that security cooperation between the two nations could proceed.
The DEA-led case against Cienfuegos appears to have been a tightly guarded secret even among U.S. agencies - with a Pentagon think-tank honoring him for his ""extraordinary"" contributions to the bilateral military relationship while the investigation was ongoing in 2018.
""If I had to guess, it is likely that the Pentagon was up in arms with the DEA going solo,"" said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington. 
""Forward looking mil-to-mil ties with Mexico, painstakingly developed over the past two decades and so dependent on confidence-building measures, were hanging in the balance.""
Security analysts were pessimistic that Mexican authorities would succeed in proving the crimes Cienfuegos had been accused of in the United States.
Ebrard said the Department of Justice had provided Mexican authorities with evidence in the case and committed to support the investigation led by Mexican authorities.

U.S. prosecutors could not immediately be reached for comment.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A growing number of South Korean women are training to be morticians, a field from which they had long been excluded, amid changing views on gender roles and a rising preference for women's bodies to be handled by women.
With recent deaths of female celebrities and prominent figures, as well as growing scrutiny of sex crimes against women, gender sensitivity is changing the way families of the deceased bid farewell to their grandmothers, mothers and daughters.
""I felt uncomfortable when my classmates of a different sex touched my body, even when I was fully dressed,"" said Park Se-jung, 19, who is in her second year of funeral directing studies. ""I sure wouldn't want them to touch, wash and dress my naked body even if I were dead. I am determined I should be the one bidding those women a proper farewell."" 
The trend comes amid growing calls for crackdowns of sexual violence against women, including a rash of hidden-camera crimes, ""revenge porn"", and online networks that blackmailed women and girls into sharing sexual and sometimes violent images of themselves.
In the early 2000s, about a third of mortician students in the country were women, but today they make up around 60% of the class, said Lee Jong-woo, a professor of embalming at Eulji University in Seongnam near Seoul.
""With Confucian ideology, death was considered a taboo in South Korea in the past, and had negative perceptions of whether women could handle such work, but the perception has been changing,"" Lee said.
YOUNG DEATHS
Funeral companies say they have been receiving more requests for female morticians.
""Most of the deaths of young people are suicides, and the families of the bereaved, especially if it was suicide and a woman, feel more comfortable if we handle the body,"" said Park Bo-ram, a funeral director of seven years.
""I recall a teenaged student, an only child ... had committed suicide,"" Park said. ""Washing and dressing the body, I saw many signs of self-injury on her thigh, but none of her family knew.""
Park recalls that the girl's parents were immensely grateful, even in the midst of sadness, that a female mortician handled their daughter's body.
South Korea’s suicide rate is the highest in the developed world: 24.6 deaths per 100,000 people in 2019, compared with an OECD average of 11.3. That year, it was the No. 1 cause of death among teenagers and people in their 20s and 30s.
More than 4,000 women committed suicide in 2019, including young female K-pop artists Koo Hara and Sulli.
In 2016, a quarter of the country's 6,200 funeral directors were women, and with more than 130,000 girls and women dying each year, requests for female funeral directors are expected to rise further, Korea Employment Information Service said.
Yet some resistance to women in the mortuary business remains. 
Shin Hwa-jin, 21, who plans to work at a funeral home after graduation, said she was shocked to hear a female mortician relate a conversation with her mother-in-law.

""Her mother-in-law asked her: 'How dare you think of cooking my meals with the hands that touched a dead body?'"" she said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's air force has grounded its F-16 fleet after losing a plane on a training mission, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday, the second loss of a fighter jet in less than a month at a time of increased missions to intercept Chinese aircraft.
While Taiwan's air force is well trained and well equipped, mostly with U.S.-made equipment, it is dwarfed by China's. Beijing claims the democratic island as its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Chinese control.
Last month, Taiwan's defence minister said nearly $900 million had been spent this year on scrambling the air force against Chinese incursions, describing the pressure they are facing as ""great"".
Late Tuesday, Taiwan's air force said a U.S.-built F-16 vanished shortly after taking off from the Hualien air base on the east coast on a routine training mission.
That followed the crash of an F-5 - a jet which first entered service in Taiwan in the 1970s - in late October.
Speaking to reporters, Tsai said the air force had already grounded the F-16 fleet for checks.
""I have asked the defence ministry not to relax a bit on defence and combat readiness to ensure national security,"" she added.
The defence ministry called on media not to speculate on what happened to the F-16, adding that missions needed to continue considering the ongoing threat from China.
""In response to the increasingly severe situation in the Taiwan Strait, the military has continued to strengthen combat readiness training to ensure national security,"" it said.
The loss of the F-16 is Taiwan's fourth military crash this year. In January, Taiwan's top military official was among eight people killed after a helicopter carrying them to visit soldiers crashed in a mountainous area near the capital Taipei.
The United States last year approved an $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a deal that would take the island's F-16 fleet to more than 200 jets, the largest in Asia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will sharply reduce the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 by mid-January, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday, stopping short of a threatened full withdrawal from America's longest war after fierce opposition from allies at home and abroad. 
Trump's decision to limit himself to a partial withdrawal was first reported by Reuters on Monday but still triggered a rebuke from senior Republicans and Democrats who fear it will undermine security and hurt fragile peace talks with the Taliban. 
Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, who Trump installed last week after abruptly firing Mark Esper, confirmed the Afghan drawdown and also outlined a modest withdrawal of forces from Iraq to reduce troop levels from 3,000 to 2,500.
""By Jan. 15, 2021, our forces, their size in Afghanistan, will be 2,500 troops. Our force size in Iraq will also be 2,500 by that same date,"" Miller told reporters.
About the same time, the top Senate Republican, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, cautioned against any major changes in U.S. defense or foreign policy in the next couple of months, including any precipitous troop drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq.
""It is extremely important here in the next couple of months not to have any earthshaking changes in regard to defense or foreign policy,"" McConnell, who opposed a pullout, told reporters.
Trump is due to leave office on Jan. 20 after losing this month's presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden. Critics slammed Trump for timing the withdrawal to his own calendar as opposed to some kind of breakthrough in Afghanistan that would justify a major drawdown.
Biden's transition team did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's troop cuts. 
The top Republican on the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, also slammed the troop cut as a ""mistake,"" as did other prominent Republicans and Democrats.
""Further reductions in Afghanistan will also undercut negotiations there; the Taliban has done nothing – met no condition – that would justify this cut,"" Thornberry said.
The top Democrat on the committee, however, Representative Adam Smith, came out in support of the move - even as he cautioned that it needed to ""be responsibly and carefully executed to ensure stability in the region.""
But those plans have yet to be hammered out in detail, officials say, leaving questions unanswered about which troops to withdraw and the impact on a mission that ranges from advising and supporting Afghan forces to carrying out counter-terrorism strikes against al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, said it was concerning that Trump’s withdrawal was being carried out without close coordination with NATO and that a hasty withdrawal risks making Afghanistan a platform for terrorism once again.
AL QAEDA CONCERNS
U.S. and Afghan officials are warning of troubling levels of violence by Taliban insurgents and persistent Taliban links to al Qaeda.
It was those ties that triggered U.S. military intervention in 2001 following the al Qaeda Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. Thousands of American and allied troops have died in fighting in Afghanistan.
Some U.S. military officials had been urging Trump to keep U.S. troop levels at around 4,500 for now. 
The withdrawal stops short of his pledge on Oct. 7, when Trump said on Twitter https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313984510749544450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1313984510749544450%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F10%2F08%2Ftrump-says-us-troops-in-afghanistan-should-be-home-by-christmas.html: ""We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas!""
That threat had alarmed U.S. military officials, U.S. allies and lawmakers, who had fiercely opposed an abrupt, unilateral pullout. 
Rick Olson, a former U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that the remaining 2,500 troops still give the United States some leverage in advancing peace efforts, but ""it would have been better to have left them at 4,500.""
""Zero would have been truly awful, while 2,500 is maybe okay, but it’s probably not very stable,” he said. “I would say 2,500 is probably stable as long as the U.S.-Taliban peace holds. But that may not happen because the Taliban have not done a reduction in violence, as they committed to do.""
Ronald Neumann, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul, cautioned that “if we are pulling out faster than the withdrawal schedule, there’s no incentive for the Taliban to negotiate."" 
The withdrawals could hand Biden a new set of challenges when he takes office. 
Taliban militants, fighting against the U.S.-backed government in Kabul, have called on the United States to stick to a February agreement with the Trump administration to withdraw U.S. troops by May, subject to certain security guarantees.
Violence has been rising throughout Afghanistan, with the Taliban attacking provincial capitals, in some case prompting U.S. airstrikes.
Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, head of the U.S. Central Command, called that violence the ""greatest obstacle to moving forward with the peace process.""
""The sheer volume of Taliban initiated attacks against the people of Afghanistan are not indicative of an organization that's serious about peace,"" McKenzie said in a podcast released this week. 

In Iraq, four rockets fell in the Green Zone in Baghdad on Tuesday, an Iraqi military statement said. The fortified zone houses government buildings and foreign missions.

PUERTO CABEZAS, Nicaragua (Reuters) - Packing record-breaking winds and unleashing torrential floods, storm Iota hit Central America on Tuesday, causing swollen rivers to burst their banks, flipping roofs onto streets, and killing at least three people. 
The strongest storm on record to reach Nicaragua, Iota struck the coast late on Monday, bringing winds of nearly 155 miles per hour (249 kph) and flooding villages still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Eta two weeks ago.
By midday (1800 GMT), the winds had fallen to 65 mph (105 kph) as Iota weakened to a tropical storm, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. But Iota continued bringing down heavy rains as it moved inland toward southern Honduras. 
""We're flooded everywhere, the rain lasted almost all night and now it stops for an hour then comes back for two to three hours,"" said Marcelo Herrera, mayor of Wampusirpi, a municipality in the interior of northeast Honduras crossed by rivers and streams.
""We need food and water for the population, because we lost our crops with Eta,"" he told Reuters.
The double punch of Eta and Iota marked the first time two major hurricanes have formed in the Atlantic basin in November since records began. The Nicaraguan port of Puerto Cabezas, still partly flooded and strewn with debris left by Eta, again bore the brunt of the hit.
Frightened residents huddled in shelters.
""We could die,"" said Inocencia Smith at one of the shelters. ""There is nothing to eat at all,"" she added, noting Eta had destroyed local farms.
The wind tore the roof off a makeshift hospital. Patients in intensive care were evacuated, including two women who gave birth during the first rains on Monday, the government said.
Guillermo Gonzalez, head of Nicaragua's disaster management agency SINAPRED, said he had received reports of damage to houses and roofs, fallen power lines and overflowing rivers, but no deaths.
Two people died on Providencia island, part of Colombia's Caribbean archipelago near the coast of Central America, after it was clipped by Iota, President Ivan Duque said on Tuesday evening.
An additional person is missing, Duque said after a visit to the island, promising speedy shipment of humanitarian aid and removal of debris. 
Nearly all of the infrastructure on Providencia - home to some 6,000 people - has been damaged or destroyed.

""If Mr. Biden is willing to fulfill U.S. commitments, we too can immediately return to our full commitments in the accord... and negotiations are possible within the framework of the P5 + 1 (six world powers in the accord),"" Zarif said in the interview posted on the website of the state-run daily Iran on Wednesday.
""We are ready to discuss how the United States can re-enter the accord,"" Zarif said. ""The situation will improve in the next few months. Biden can lift all sanctions with three executive orders.""
Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the 2015 accord, agreed by Washington when he was vice president, if Iran also returns to compliance. 
But diplomats and analysts have said it was unlikely to happen overnight as the distrustful adversaries would both want additional commitments from each other.
In the deal with the United States and other world powers, Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. It began breaching the nuclear deal after President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 and started ratcheting up unilateral sanctions on Tehran.
Zarif did not insist on any compensation from the United States, unlike leaders such as President Hassan Rouhani who have demanded it in exchange for the ""damages"" Tehran has suffered under the renewed U.S. sanctions, implicitly arguing Washington should repay it for the lost oil revenues.

""This can be done automatically, and with no need to set conditions: the United States carries out its duties under (Security Council Resolution) 2231 (lift sanctions) and we will carry out our commitments under the nuclear deal,"" said Zarif in a video recording of the interview issued by the newspaper.

The package will also include a schedule for UK's vaccination programme and an expansion of mass testing, which is expected to soften the blow of further restrictions, the report added. 
Under current social distancing guidance, meetings of larger groups are against the law, though people from different households can gather in groups.
These restrictions are applicable in England until Dec. 2, when the national lockdown will end.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Four Katyusha rockets landed in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone and security officials said the attack targeted the U.S. embassy, Iraqi police and security sources said on Tuesday.
Sirens blared from the embassy inside the zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions. One security source said at least four rockets were fired and some of them landed nearby.
A military statement said that seven Katyusha rockets were fired, four that fell inside the Green Zone and three outside, which killed a child and wounded five people.
The military said earlier four rockets were fired from an eastern district of the capital, but did not provide more details.
Footage from the military showed a rocket launcher fixed on the back of a mini-truck which was set on fire.
Two diplomatic sources based inside the Green Zone said they heard an anti-rocket system set up to defend the U.S. embassy. One of the sources said a blast shook the building.
U.S. officials blame Iran-backed militia for regular rocket attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq, including near the embassy in Baghdad. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed responsibility.
An array of Iran-backed Iraqi militia groups announced in October that they have suspended rocket attacks on U.S. forces on condition that Iraq's government present a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops.
A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq, said the groups were presenting no set deadline, but that if U.S. troops ""insisted on staying,"" they would unleash much more violent attacks.
The announcement on halting rocket attacks was made after Washington, which is slowly reducing its 5,000 troops in Iraq, threatened to shut its embassy unless the Iraqi government reins in Iran-aligned militias.
Tuesday's attack could be a sign that Iranian-backed militias have decided to resume attacks on U.S. bases, a move that puts more pressure on Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi and his efforts to contain the groups.

Some $30 million will be spent in Yemen, $15 million each in Afghanistan and northeast Nigeria, $7 million each in South Sudan and Democratic Republic of the Congo and $6 million in Burkina Faso. Lowcock said $20 million had also been set aside in anticipation of a worsening situation in Ethiopia. 
""The prospect of a return to a world in which famines are commonplace would be heart wrenching and obscene in a world where there is more than enough food for everyone. Famines result in agonizing and humiliating deaths,"" Lowcock said. 
""Their impact on a country is devastating and long lasting,"" he said in a statement. 
Nearly $500 million has been paid into the U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund in 2020. It is used to enable the world body to respond quickly to new humanitarian crises or underfunded emergencies without having to wait for earmarked donations.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A wealthy California couple were sentenced to prison time on Tuesday after admitting they paid $250,000 to fraudulently help their daughter gain admission to the University of Southern California as a volleyball recruit.
Diane Blake, the co-founder of a retail merchandising company, and Todd Blake, an entrepreneur and investor, were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston to six weeks and to four months in prison, respectively.
They are among 57 people charged in relation to a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to fraudulently secure spots for their children at universities.
Singer pleaded guilty in 2019 to facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and using bribery to secure the admission of students to selective universities as fake athletic recruits.
The parents include ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman, who received a 14-day prison sentence, and ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin, who was sentenced to two months in prison.
During a virtual hearing, Gorton also ordered the Blakes to each pay a $125,000 fine. The judge, who has sentenced eight other parents, said the case ""boggles the mind.""
""I remain unable to understand the misguided and warped thinking that resulted in the commission of this crime,"" he said.
Diane Blake, 55, co-founded Winston Retail Solutions, whose clients included  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and  Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA), according to court records. Todd Blake, 55, worked from home as an investor.
Prosecutors said the Ross, California, residents agreed in 2017 to pay $50,000 in ""donations"" to a USC athletic fund and $200,000 to Singer's non-profit to secure an illicit guarantee of admission for their daughter.
The donations went to an account controlled by a USC official that prosecutors said accepted bribes to help the children of Singer's clients gain admission as athletic recruits.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a ""warm conversation"" with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday, Netanyahu's office said, in a delayed and clear acknowledgement of Biden's election defeat of the Israeli leader's ally Donald Trump.
""The two agreed to meet soon to discuss the many issues that are pending and reaffirmed the need to continue to strengthen the strong alliance between the United States and Israel,"" the Israeli statement said.
In a statement Biden's transition team said: ""The president-elect thanked the prime minister for his congratulations and reiterated his steadfast support for Israel’s security and its future as a Jewish and democratic state.""
Netanyahu had congratulated Biden and running mate Kamala Harris on Twitter on Nov. 8, a day after the Democrat declared victory in the U.S. election. On Twitter, right-winger Netanyahu also thanked Trump for his friendship towards Israel.
In those messages and in subsequent public remarks, Netanyahu refrained from referring to Biden as ""president-elect"", in what was widely seen as an attempt to avoid angering Trump, who has challenged his rival's victory.
But the statement issued after Netanyahu and Biden spoke used that term and said they had ""a warm conversation"" in which the president-elect ""reiterated his deep commitment to the State of Israel and its security"".
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, whose post is largely ceremonial, also spoke to Biden on Tuesday, congratulating him on his election and calling him a ""long-standing friend"" of Israel, Rivlin's spokesman said.
In a statement later directed at Rivlin, the Biden transition team said the president-elect ""looks forward to working with Israel to build an ever stronger partnership between our two countries.""
Having been in lockstep with Trump for four years, Netanyahu will likely be challenged by any Biden departure from Trump’s tough policy on Iran and towards the Palestinians.
Biden has pledged to restore U.S. involvement in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal - which Trump had pulled out of - and likely opposition by the White House to Israeli settlement of occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood.
Earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, was non-committal when asked in an interview on Galei Israel radio who he believed won the U.S. election.

""Why do I have to express an opinion?"" he replied. ""They have an internal process - the Electoral College. I think everybody more or less understands what ... is apparently going to happen officially.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's former main opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said he has been readmitted to the Labour Party after being suspended following his comments downplaying a report critical of its handling of anti-Semitism complaints. 
The Equality and Human Rights Commission said in October it had found evidence of failure adequately to train people investigating alleged anti-Semitism, political interference in the processing of complaints, and harassment of individuals.
Corbyn, 71, reacted to the report by saying the scale of Labour's anti-Semitism problem had been overstated by the media and his political opponents, and that his attempts to deal with the issue had been blocked by ""obstructive party bureaucracy"".
Current leader Keir Starmer has been trying to make a clean break from the hard-left Corbyn era as he seeks to turn around Labour's fortunes after four successive general election defeats since 2010.
""I know that this has been another painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle antisemitism,"" Starmer wrote on Twitter.
""I am absolutely resolute in my determination to make the Labour Party a safe place for Jewish people."" 
Corbyn welcomed the decision by Labour's National Executive Committee to reinstate him after three weeks and said the focus should now be on challenging Prime Minister Boris Johnson's administration. 
""Our movement must now come together to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government,"" he said. 
But the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Jewish Leadership Council and Community Security Trust were critical of Corbyn's readmission in a joint statement. 

""Labour’s mountain to climb to win back the trust of our community just got higher,"" they said.

The mandate will allow Turkish troops to be stationed at the centre for one year as part of an accord between Ankara and Moscow to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire, which locked in territorial gains by Azerbaijan. Some 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are now also deploying to the region.
In a letter to parliament asking for the mandate's approval, President Tayyip Erdogan said the presence of Turkish troops and, ""if needed, civilian personnel from our country, (will) be to the benefit of the peace and prosperity of the regional people, and necessary for our national interests"".
The ceasefire signed on Nov. 10 halted military action in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians, after the worst fighting in the region since the 1990s.
Turkey has accused Armenia of occupying Azeri lands and pledged solidarity with its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan. 
Ankara has blamed the Minsk group - formed to mediate the conflict and led by Russia, France and the United States - of freezing the issue for nearly 30 years.

A Russian military delegation held talks in Turkey last week to discuss the parameters of the Turkish-Russian centre. Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Tuesday Ankara and Moscow's cooperation would continue.

The Moroccan army entered the buffer zone on Friday to open a road linking Western Sahara with Mauritania which had been blocked by Polisario supporters and fighters, leading the group to quit the 29-year-old truce agreement. 
Speaking in an interview with Reuters, El Otmani reiterated that Morocco was sticking to the ceasefire and said there had been only ""skirmishes and sporadic fighting"" in recent days as concerns grew that a long-frozen conflict could reignite. 
The Algeria-backed Polisario says it has repeatedly bombarded Moroccan positions on the sand wall that Rabat built in the 1980s along much of the frontier running for hundreds of miles through the desert. 
The United Nations mission ""continues to receive reports of shots being fired during the night at various locations along the berm"", U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday. 
El Otmani said the wall had now been extended to the Mauritanian border ""with the goal of securing once and for all civilian and commercial traffic in Guerguerat between Morocco and Mauritania"". 
The Guerguerat crossing is in a demilitarised buffer zone under U.N. observation set up as part of the 1991 ceasefire agreement. 
Morocco described the blocking of the road by Polisario supporters, backed by armed fighters, as a breach of the ceasefire. The Polisario said the Moroccan army's entry into the buffer zone had fatally undermined the ceasefire. 
El Otmani said the Moroccan army had orders to respond to attacks. ""Up to now, there is nothing to worry about along the security wall and in the Moroccan Sahara in general,"" he said.
The Polisario front seeks Western Sahara’s independence from Morocco, which has held the vast desert region since Spain quit in 1975 and regards it as an integral part of its own land.
Rabat has said the most it can offer as a political solution to the dispute is autonomy. The Polisario and its ally Algeria reject this and say they want a referendum, with independence for Western Sahara as one of the options.

Opponents say the law would infringe journalists' freedom to report on public events, and make it harder to hold officers accountable if, for example, they use excessive violence while detaining a suspect. 
Lawmakers on Tuesday began debating whether to adopt the law, which is backed by President Emmanuel Macron's party and its parliamentary allies.
Under the proposed law, anyone circulating a police officer's image with the intention that the officer should be harmed as a result is liable to be jailed for a year and ordered to pay a 45,000 euro ($53,450) fine.
Several hundred protesters gathered outside parliament in central Paris carrying placards saying: ""You'll be deprived of your liberties for your own safety,"" and ""Stop the law!""
Campaign group Reporters without Borders (RSF) said the proposed law, in its current form, could force broadcasters to pixellate images of police officers' faces in case those images were later shared on social media by private citizens.
""Lawmakers have in their hands a draft law which could significantly hamper the work of journalists,"" RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement.
Supporters say the planned law does not stop journalists reporting on the actions of police, but is designed to protect officers and their families from being trolled online and harassed or attacked when off duty.

""It's our police officers who are the first victims,"" Eric Ciotti, a lawmaker and one of the authors of the draft, wrote on Twitter. ""Let's protect them.""

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria refused on Tuesday to approve the European Union's membership negotiation framework for North Macedonia, effectively blocking the official start of accession talks with its smaller Balkan neighbour.
Foreign Minister Ekaterina Zaharieva said Sofia could not back for now the start of long-delayed accession negotiations between the 27-member EU and Skopje due to open disputes over history and language, but remained open for talks.
""Bulgaria, at this stage, cannot back the draft of the negotiation framework with the Republic of North Macedonia and the holding of the first intergovernmental conference,"" she said after EU ministers discussed the subject in an online meeting. 
The official launch of the accession talks with North Macedonia and Albania was expected to take place at an intergovernmental conference in December. Zaharieva said Bulgaria backed the negotiation framework for Albania.
Following a video meeting of Europe ministers, Germany's Michael Roth, whose country holds the EU presidency, said it was up to Bulgaria and North Macedonia to resolve their dispute before EU leaders could allow the accession talks to start.
""We want to be helpful, we want to clear the path as much as possible, so that we can start on those intergovernmental conferences,"" Roth also told an online news conference.
Bulgaria's move poses a further challenge to the former Yugoslav republic, which had to agree to add the word ""North"" to its official name to settle a decades-long stand-off with Greece to clear its path to EU membership.
North Macedonia and Albania then had to wait until March this year to get a green light for EU membership talks after France had expressed scepticism in 2019 over their track record on democracy and fighting corruption.
GUARANTEES
North Macedonia, Albania and four other Western Balkan countries - Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia - are trying to join the EU following the ethnic wars of the 1990s that led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia.
Bringing the Western Balkans into the EU fold will help boost living standards and offset growing Russian and Chinese influence in the region, supporters say.
Bulgaria, which has long pushed for the EU integration of the Western Balkans, wants guarantees in the negotiation framework that Skopje will deliver on a 2017 friendship treaty with Sofia that deals mainly with historical issues.

Sofia also seeks guarantees that North Macedonia will not support any claims for a Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. It also wants official EU documents to avoid mention of the ""Macedonian language"", which it says derives from Bulgarian.

""The day is important for people so most are commemorating the Velvet Revolution from their homes,"" said Lukas Cerny, an organiser with the ""Diky, ze muzem"" (Thanks that We Can) group.
""It's important we didn't cancel everything because I think it is even more important to remind people of freedom and democracy,"" he said.

People watching online could light a candle via the group's volunteers at a memorial in central Prague, where police beat up student protesters in 1989, a crackdown that led to wider rallies against communist rule and its demise.
People could also light candles spaced-out on Prague's Wenceslas Square.
Hundreds of demonstrators also gathered on Wenceslas Square to protest coronavirus lockdown measures that have shut shops, restaurants and other public venues, before marching through the city. 
Elsewhere, Czech singer Aneta Langerova performed ""A Prayer for Marta"" - an unofficial anthem of the Velvet Revolution - on the National Theatre's balcony, which could be heard on television and radio stations across the country.
A regular concert on Wenceslas Square was taking place via streaming, without an audience. Other events were moved, cancelled or had limited crowds.

U.S. President Donald Trump has made ending the 19-year-old American engagement in Afghanistan a priority by Christmas, but while many NATO allies also want to leave the country, many feel it could be reckless given militant violence plaguing Afghanistan.
""The price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high,"" Stoltenberg said in a statement.
""Afghanistan risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organise attacks on our homelands. And ISIS could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq,"" he said, referring to Islamic State militants. 
Trump fired his defence secretary, Mark Esper, and appointed other top Pentagon officials last week, in part because of frustration that not enough was being done to meet his Christmas withdrawal target. 
But Reuters reported on Tuesday that Trump's new Pentagon team has not yet signalled an imminent withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, raising expectations among U.S. officials and allies that Trump might settle for a partial reduction before leaving office.
The United States has around 4,500 troops currently in Afghanistan. Including the United States, there are under 12,000 NATO troops overall in Afghanistan, Stoltenberg said in his statement. 
Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, Esper's replacement, spoke to Stoltenberg by phone on Nov. 13 and discussed coordination in Afghanistan.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia warned on Tuesday that a deadline for rebel northern forces to surrender had expired, triggering a push on the Tigray region's capital in a two-week conflict shaking the Horn of Africa and alarming the world.
""The final critical act of law enforcement will be done in the coming days,"" Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said, noting a three-day ultimatum to lay down arms was over. 
Africa's youngest leader and the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Abiy launched air strikes and a ground offensive on Nov. 4 after accusing former comrades and the local ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), of armed revolt.
Tigrayan leaders say Abiy, 44, who comes from the largest ethnic group the Oromo, has persecuted and purged them from government and security positions since taking office in 2018.
Tigrayan forces have fired rockets into the neighbouring nation of Eritrea, escalating a conflict which has already killed hundreds - one diplomatic source said thousands - and sent about 30,000 refugees into Sudan.
""How could they kill their own brothers and sisters? This is not our custom,"" Addis Ababa resident Fitawrari Million said of the Tigrayan leaders during a rally to honour federal soldiers.

'PEOPLE ARE SCARED'
The United Nations said a ""full-scale humanitarian crisis"" was unfolding. With communications largely down and media barred, Reuters could not independently verify assertions by either side nor the situation on the ground.
""People are coming out of Ethiopia really scared, afraid, with stories saying they have been fleeing heavy fighting and there's no sign of the fighting stopping,"" said Babar Baloch, spokesman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 
Abiy's air force struck unspecified TPLF targets outside Tigray's capital Mekelle on Monday.
Tigray's leaders have accused federal forces of knocking out a dam and a sugar factory as well as ""mercilessly"" attacking people in the region of more than 5 million.
The government denies targeting civilians. 
After an Amnesty International report of a massacre of scores of labourers, where it cited witnesses blaming TPLF forces, the U.N. rights chief said war crimes may have been committed.
Washington condemned the Tigrayans' weekend attack against the airport of Eritrea's capital, and urged a de-escalation of the war and protection of civilians.
In a sign the push towards Mekelle may not be going as well as Abiy wants, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters battles were still ongoing around the southern town of Alamata which federal troops said they seized the previous day.
An Ethiopian spokesman could not be reached for comment.
With hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans dependent on food aid even before the conflict, suffering is worsening even as humanitarian workers are pulling out for their own safety.
Two convoys moved about 600 people, mainly foreigners with international organisations, out of Tigray to the capital Addis Ababa this week, diplomats said. 
Governments around Europe and Africa are clamouring for talks and even the Nobel committee voiced concern in rare comment on a past laureate's actions.
But Abiy has said he will only negotiate when rule of law is restored in Tigray, whose leaders are former military comrades whom he also partnered in government until 2018.
REGIONAL WAVES
On Monday, his foreign minister went to Uganda and Kenya, while a Nigerian former president flew to Addis Ababa. Diplomats described a growing push for negotiations, but Ethiopia said it was simply explaining an internal conflict to outsiders. 
Africa's second-most populous country has long been a powerful Western ally in a volatile region. 
The fighting could jeopardise the recent opening up of Ethiopia's economy, stir ethnic bloodshed elsewhere around the vast nation of 115 million people, and tarnish the reputation of Abiy. He won his Nobel for pursuing peace with Eritrea and had drawn praise for opening up a repressive political system, though arrests and media curbs had tainted that of late.
His forces comprise around 140,000 personnel and are battle-hardened from fighting in Somalia, rebellious border regions and Eritrea in the past. But many officers were Tigrayan, much powerful weaponry is there, and the TPLF has seized the powerful Northern Command's headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF itself is a formidable rival also with a proud history: it spearheaded the toppling of a Marxist dictatorship in 1991 and bore the brunt of the 1998-2000 war with Eritrea.

Adding to the squeeze on the TPLF, state-affiliated Fana TV said Ethiopia had frozen bank accounts of 34 of its institutions including construction, trading, engineering, printing, electrical and bus companies.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's president will do what it takes to prevent a repeat of demonstrations against police brutality last month that led to unrest in which dozens of protesters and police were killed and more than 200 buildings torched, the police minister said.
Protests against an elite police force, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, or SARS, led last month to the worst civil unrest in Nigeria since the return to civilian rule in 1999.
Thousands of Nigerians took to the streets under the slogan ""ENDSars"" to protest against the force, which the demonstrators blame for killings, torture and extortion.
Though the protests were initially peaceful, demonstrators in an upmarket Lagos district were shot at on Oct. 20 by men witnesses said were soldiers. Rights group Amnesty international said 12 protesters were killed. The army denied involvement.
In days of unrest that followed, police said 22 of their personnel were killed and 205 buildings including police stations were damaged.
""Mr President assured Nigerians that he will do whatever it takes to ensure the repeat of 'ENDSars' protests does not occur in Nigeria again,"" Police Minister Muhammad Dingyadi told reporters on Tuesday after a meeting of security officials and President Muhammadu Buhari in the capital, Abuja.
""What we are saying is that government will continue to dialogue, it will continue to listen and will continue to carry all stakeholders along in ensuring that there is no repeat of what happened that destroyed a lot of properties,"" Dingyadi said when asked for more details on Buhari's comments.
Buhari, a military ruler in the 1980s before being elected president in 2015, has previously said that his administration agreed to implement police reforms sought by protesters.

The SARS unit was officially disbanded in the wake of the protests, but Buhari's critics say it has simply been renamed.

WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's directive barring U.S. investments in Chinese companies linked by Washington to China's military is unlikely to deal the firms a serious blow, experts said, due to its limited scope, uncertainty about the stance of the incoming Biden administration and already-scant holdings by U.S. funds.
The executive order, first reported by Reuters, was signed by Trump on Thursday as he sought to curb access by American investors to 31 Chinese firms labeled by the Pentagon as ""owned or controlled"" by China's military.
The affected companies included China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU), which is affiliated with China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd. Their shares declined roughly 8% and 7% respectively on Friday, as investors fretted about potential grave damage to the companies, and have edged down further since. 
But there were limits built into Trump's directive. The order offered the possibility of licenses to circumvent the restrictions and stopped short of ""blocking"" the companies, a tougher sanctioning tool that would include freezing assets and banning all transactions with Americans.
It officially goes into effect on Jan. 11. But the directive does not ban new purchases of the securities until November 2021 and allows U.S. investors to continue to own or sell shares they already hold in the targeted companies, raising further questions about its impact.
""This will likely deter investment in the companies, but is not likely to inflict the kind of critical injury, as well as unintended collateral damage, that would result from a full blocking of the companies,"" said Matthew Tuchband, a Washington-based attorney with the firm Arent Fox and a former Treasury Department official.
President-elect Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 election, is due to take office on Jan. 20. His administration could recalibrate relations with China. 
""Some investors may hold their breath to see whether President-elect Biden will reverse or modify the course of these and other Trump-era China restrictions,"" Tuchband added.
Biden would have the authority to revoke or replace the order if he wanted to do so. A current U.S. official familiar with the directive's rollout, speaking on condition of anonymity, raised doubts about how strictly Biden would enforce it.
The White House declined to respond to questions about whether it planned to tighten any provisions in the order.
The directive was part of Trump's efforts to ramp up pressure on China by limiting its access to Wall Street, as relations between Washington and Beijing have soured over issues including the coronavirus pandemic and a Chinese crackdown on Hong Kong. The order was aimed at giving teeth to the Pentagon designations that were mandated by law two decades ago but not disclosed until this past summer.
Its impact also may be diminished by the fact that while hundreds of U.S. funds continue to own shares in the targeted companies, these holdings tend to be small. A top foreign holder of China Telecom, the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, owned just $68 million as of Sept. 30, compared to its $400 billion in total assets.
Dave Nadig, director of research for ETF Trends that focuses on exchange traded funds, estimated that U.S. funds own about $8.2 billion worth of shares across 13 of the targeted companies, just a tiny fraction of the investor bases of the Chinese firms. 
""These are companies that already have been kind of on the gray list for a lot of investors,"" said Judith Lee, a Washington-based trade lawyer with the firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, referring to the Pentagon listing of companies as linked to China's military. 
""People are still going to treat these as toxic ... but they have already diminished their holdings in these companies,"" Lee added.

U.S. funds, especially passive ones that follow indexes constructed by providers like MSCI Inc, could face administrative headaches if they end up selling their shares in the targeted Chinese companies. An MSCI spokeswoman said the company was monitoring the situation.

667,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 11:37AM ET</span>","Special Report: A cop shoots a Black man, and a police union flexes its muscle","By Lisa Girion and Reade Levinson
ROCHESTER, New York (Reuters) - By the time Officer Joseph Ferrigno shot a Black man from behind, court records show, the Rochester cop had drawn at least 23 misconduct complaints in nearly nine years on the force.
One came from a woman who said Ferrigno, a burly hockey player, slammed her to the ground and broke one of her ribs. Another was from a one-legged man dumped from his wheelchair at a bus stop and roughed up by Ferrigno and two other officers.
Through it all, the Rochester Police Department and the Locust Club, the local police union, stood by Ferrigno. By his own account, the officer never once was disciplined for using excessive force.
Then came April 1, 2016, when Ferrigno – alone in his squad car on a chilly, moonless night – made the most fateful decision of his career.
Two hours into his shift, Ferrigno spotted a Chevrolet Impala, the same model driven by a Black man suspected of threatening a woman with a gun a few days before. Without turning on his overhead lights or siren, Ferrigno followed for a few blocks, then watched as the driver backed into a driveway on a residential street. The officer pulled in front of the driveway, flipped on his cruiser’s spotlight and trained it on the Impala. He saw two Black men inside. 
Ferrigno drew his Glock handgun, jumped out and shouted, “stay in the car,” he later told detectives in a sworn statement.
Silvon Simmons, the passenger in the Impala, remembers the moment differently. He heard no warning, he told Reuters. Blinded by the spotlight, he couldn’t make out anything about the car blocking the narrow driveway. 
Simmons, a 34-year-old equipment deliveryman, wasn't the man wanted by police. Nor was the car’s driver, who lived next door. The two later explained they were coming home from a trip to the store.
As Simmons stepped from the Impala and squinted into the spotlight, he told Reuters, he was terrified by the silhouette that emerged: a large figure charging toward him, gun in hand. In a neighborhood where gunplay is common, Simmons turned and ran toward the back door of the house where he lived with his girlfriend and their three boys.
Ferrigno, 33, had been on the lookout for a man driving an Impala. Even so, the cop ran past the driver, pursuing Simmons into the darkness. Suddenly, Ferrigno told detectives, he saw a “white flash” and heard a “loud bang.” Simmons “was shooting at me,” the officer said, “and the fear came over me that he was going to continue until he got me.”
Ferrigno fired four shots, hitting Simmons three times – in his back, his buttock and his right thigh.
A second officer soon arrived, and the two approached the Black man bleeding in the grass. There, Ferrigno later told detectives, he spotted something: “the suspect’s gun on the ground next to him.” Simmons later said that he hadn’t fired a gun and didn’t even own one.
Cops swarmed the scene. At least four – including a detective who led the investigation into Simmons – held official positions in the union. Also quick to arrive was the union’s boss, Locust Club President Michael Mazzeo. 
Before leaving the scene, Ferrigno asked for two things: a lawyer and a union rep. The officer, who told detectives he “was shaking and still in a state of shock,” was driven to the station and later sent home. 
Simmons, stripped naked by paramedics treating his wounds, was handcuffed and loaded into an ambulance. Although Simmons was the one who took three bullets, Ferrigno is listed as the victim in at least 65 police reports.
POLICE POLICING POLICE
Simmons’ experience, from the moment Ferrigno spotted the Impala to the surprising conclusion in a courtroom almost two years later, offers a detailed anatomy of the policing tactics and policies that have driven mass protests across the United States. The shooting and its aftermath are also emblematic of the difficulties facing many American cities attempting to remake their police forces.
In Rochester, New York’s third-largest city, elected leaders have lost much of their authority in overseeing the city’s police force to a strong union. Today, officials here are working to overcome formidable legal roadblocks to reclaim some of that power. 
The city council is trying to establish a civilian board with the power to discipline cops. The union, which represents about 700 of the department’s 900 employees, is fighting the move in court. A judge has ruled in its favor.
Such struggles to give communities greater oversight are playing out in much of America, where – with few exceptions – police are left to police themselves.
That power to ward off outside scrutiny derives from union contracts and state labor laws. Reuters analyzed labor contracts signed or extended over the last five years by 100 of the nation’s largest cities. Most – 88 – set strict limits on how civilian complaints are investigated or how cops are punished. Even with policing under intense scrutiny nationwide, unions in some cities recently have won new rights that make oversight even harder. Such protections enable cops with histories of misconduct complaints, like Ferrigno, to remain on the beat. 
Beyond their favorable contracts, unions have used state labor laws to force cities to negotiate over broader department policies. They have successfully contested changes to where officers are assigned, who directs traffic, who catalogs evidence and who answers 911 calls.
Empowered by statutes and court rulings, unions have moved into “the actual policy and running of police departments,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington, D.C.-based think-tank that advises chiefs.
Rochester’s leaders, like those of many cities, share blame for being in this predicament. Amid a recession in the 1980s, many municipalities bargained away some disciplinary authority in exchange for police wage freezes.
Now, when cities try to claw back control, they often fail. Citing state labor laws, courts across the country have held that cities are prohibited from changing police disciplinary policies or procedures unilaterally. In addition, both law-and-order Republicans and pro-labor Democrats in many states have approved “bills of rights” that expand protections for cops beyond what other government workers get.
The Locust Club’s Mazzeo and other union bosses say they’re protecting public servants who have answered a dangerous calling. Rochester cops patrol a city where the rate of violent crime is twice the national average. 
Since 1950, two Rochester police officers have been fatally shot while on the job, union records show. The most recent was in 2014, when Officer Daryl Pierson was shot and killed during a foot chase following a traffic stop.
Failing to defend officers accused of wrongdoing, no matter how disturbing a cop’s conduct may seem at first glance, is akin to sacrificing them to a mob, union leaders say. Cities should focus on better policies and training, they argue, and altering the protections officers enjoy won’t succeed without union buy-in.
But Wexler, the adviser to police chiefs, says all sides are losing in today’s struggle. In the smartphone era, as more police violence is captured on video, the slow pace of responding to public concerns about policing creates greater peril for union members, city leaders and the residents that both serve. As Wexler put it: “Every police department is one incident away from chaos.” 
HISTORY OF MISTRUST
For its examination of the Simmons case, Reuters talked to dozens of people and reviewed thousands of pages of government documents, including police reports, crime scene photographs, evidence logs, audio recordings and trial testimony. Ferrigno couldn’t be interviewed for this article. A Rochester police official said department rules prohibit any of the officers involved in the case, including Ferrigno, from speaking publicly about it.
The Simmons shooting didn’t gain much attention outside this city of 206,000, which has fallen on hard times since the Eastman Kodak Company faded as the global king of photography. But for some locals, the case of a white officer – Ferrigno – who shot a Black man – Simmons – became the latest chapter in decades of mistrust between cops and a community.
In July 1964, cops brought police dogs on a call to arrest a drunk man at a street party in a Black neighborhood, sparking days of riots. In 1993, federal lawyers unsuccessfully prosecuted five narcotics officers who allegedly robbed, beat and tortured suspects in predominantly minority neighborhoods. One of those acquitted: Mazzeo, who became head of the union 15 years later, in 2008. 
Rochester police officers have shot at least 44 people since 1970, a Reuters review of press accounts found. Of those, 23 died. At least a dozen officers involved in those shootings were recognized later that year for distinguished or excellent service. One received a key to the city.
The schism between the city’s overwhelmingly white police force and many of its residents – 40% of whom are Black – grew even wider in September, when protests flared over how police treated another Black man. 
Daniel Prude, 41, died after he was arrested in March during a psychotic episode. About five months later, video of the arrest became public. It showed a naked Prude handcuffed and hooded while an officer pressed his face into the pavement. 
The footage hardened concerns that the use of force by officers remains largely unchecked, with Black residents often suffering the consequences. It brought into focus a key issue Reuters found in examining the Simmons shooting – namely, the insularity of a department policing itself. And it again illustrated the power of Rochester’s storied police union.
The Locust Club, which started as a social club for cops, is named for a kind of wood used to make nightsticks. In its early years as a union, it built a reputation for confrontation. Its members once tried unsuccessfully to pressure city officials for a raise by ticketing their cars. Another time, cops campaigned for overtime pay by staging a six-hour walkout, in violation of a judge’s order. The city agreed almost immediately to return to the bargaining table, and cops won overtime. 
The Locust Club also fought efforts to allow outsiders to play even an advisory role in disciplining officers. Among its first moves: waging a five-year legal challenge against a civilian-led police advisory board that, the union said, was unconstitutional and “hostile to the police and ignorant of police problems.” 
The union lost the court battle but won the war: In 1970, soon after the Locust Club exhausted its appeals, a new Republican mayor effectively killed the board by eliminating its funding.
In the 1990s, the city tried again, creating a new civilian review board. But the board’s powers were limited, and the Locust Club, after threatening to sue, never bothered.
Instead, the union focused on something more valuable to members: new contract provisions defining how officers are investigated for suspected wrongdoing and disciplined for misconduct. Decades later, these provisions would come into play the moment Ferrigno shot Simmons.
TAKING THE BIBLE
Simmons’ encounter with the cop played out similarly to others that have stoked outrage against police in other cities: A Black man minding his business gets stopped by a cop and then gets shot.
That's not how the drama was framed on the news the next day.
Police said they had been searching for a man wanted for threatening a woman with a gun. Ferrigno had been shot at and returned fire, striking his alleged assailant three times, the reports said. The suspect was in critical condition. 
Absent from news accounts was a fact police investigators knew as soon as they pulled Simmons’ driver’s license from his pocket: He wasn’t the man the cops were after. Nor was the driver, a friend who fled to his own house next door.
Simmons woke up handcuffed to a hospital bed, breathing through a tube and flanked by uniformed Rochester police officers. He had a fractured rib, a collapsed lung and bullets that surgeons left in his chest and pelvis.
Police wouldn't let him watch television or see family or a pastor. They refused to answer his questions. 
They also took away a source of solace. From a report filed by a Rochester police officer three days after the shooting: “I noticed that Silvon Simmons had a Bible in his hands. I did take that Bible away from him and gave it to the nurse. I did advise her that he isn’t allowed to have the Bible in his possession at this point in time.”
Although the breathing tube prevented Simmons from talking, he tried to prod police to clear him.
“Did they check me for Residue,” he wrote on a piece of paper collected by a police guard. “RESIDUE. Gun Powder. Can you ask please.” 
Simmons told Reuters he knew that no residue would be found on his palms or the sweatshirt he had on that night. That’s because, as he repeatedly told police, the Ruger found near his feet wasn’t his. 
Police didn’t test for residue. They did, however, search his home and car for bullets, holsters, gun cleaning supplies, or anything else that might indicate Simmons owned the Ruger. They found nothing to help their case. 
When Simmons was taken off the ventilator, his first visitors were police detectives. He asked for a lawyer. He said the gun wasn’t his. On sedatives and the powerful pain reliever oxycodone, Simmons protested that detectives were taking advantage of him. 
The detectives continued the interrogation anyway; a judge later ruled the interview violated Simmons’ right to counsel.
""I’M THE ONE WHO GOT SHOT” 
Ferrigno’s turn with detectives went differently. It would be five days before investigators questioned him about his actions that night, after negotiating conditions with his lawyer and Locust Club representatives. 
Such delays can make figuring out what happened more difficult, said Stephen Rushin, a criminal law professor at Chicago’s Loyola University. “The first 48 hours are some of the most important periods of time to get to the truth and make sure that people can’t construct stories to deflect blame,” Rushin said.
Ferrigno gave his statement in the office of a private lawyer provided by the union. The detectives were fellow members of the Locust Club.
The day before Ferrigno’s interview, a Monroe County Court judge arraigned Simmons in the hospital. Simmons hadn’t yet had a chance to meet his public defender, and the charges were grave: attempted aggravated murder, attempted aggravated assault of a police officer, and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.
As it happened, Judge Melchor Castro had seen Simmons before.
In 2013, Castro had signed off on a plea deal and sentenced Simmons to a year in jail for misdemeanor assault. Simmons told authorities that a neighbor in Rochester’s sometimes tough Dutchtown section had pulled a gun and then shot at his truck as Simmons hurried to get away, court documents show. Simmons escaped without injury, but only after he deliberately struck and injured the neighbor with his Dodge Durango SUV, according to court records. 
During the brief hearing in 2013, Simmons was told that he was waiving any rights, “such as self defense in this matter,” by taking the plea deal. Simmons replied, “yes, sir.” He served eight months.
When Castro came to his hospital room in 2016 to explain the charges, this time Simmons was incredulous. “What in the world are you talking about?” Simmons recalled telling the judge. “I’m the one who got shot.”
Bail was set at $250,000. Simmons remembered it as “some crazy numbers that we couldn't ever do. Never.”
Frank and Sharlene Simmons, retired and living in Tennessee, drove nearly a thousand miles to be by their son’s side.
At the hospital, they were stopped at the nurses’ station. Sharlene scanned the intensive care bays until she saw her son “chained” to the bed and surrounded by guards. The sight “just broke us to pieces,” she recalled. Frank, a decorated Marine veteran who served in Vietnam, said it seemed like Simmons was being treated “like a POW.” 
His parents say Simmons had been a good student. He played shortstop on a youth baseball team sponsored by the Rochester Police Department. As a boy, he thought about becoming a cop like his cousin, who at the time was on the Rochester force. Eventually, he followed his father into a job delivering heating and air conditioning equipment. 
In early 2017, after Simmons had been in jail for nearly a year, a county prosecutor offered a deal. The most serious charge – attempting to kill a police officer – and two weapons charges would be dismissed. But only if he pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated assault on an officer and accepted a 15-year sentence. 
Rejecting the deal meant risking life in prison. Public defender Elizabeth Riley presented the prosecutor’s offer. She said his response was immediate.
“No. I didn’t do it,” Simmons told her. “I’m not taking that deal.”

668,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Special Report: A Black man risks all to clear his name - and expose the police,"By Reade Levinson and Lisa Girion
ROCHESTER, New York (Reuters) - In a courthouse holding cell, Silvon Simmons changed from a jail jumpsuit into dress pants, a shirt and a tie. As a kid, he imagined becoming a police officer. Now a 36-year-old father, Simmons was preparing to stand trial in October 2017, facing life in prison for allegedly trying to kill a cop.
The officer, Joseph Ferrigno, had shot Simmons three times from behind. Ferrigno, a Rochester Police patrolman, insisted that Simmons had fired first. The cop reported finding a 9mm Ruger pistol a few feet from where Simmons lay bleeding.
The Rochester Police Department and the police union backed up Ferrigno. One of his most outspoken supporters: the union’s boss, Locust Club President Michael Mazzeo. He said he never doubted Ferrigno’s account of what happened the night of April 1, 2016.
“That officer got shot at, and he returned fire,” Mazzeo said.
A police official said Ferrigno and other officers involved in the case are prohibited from speaking publicly. But even before testimony began in the Simmons trial, their narrative of that night emerged in police reports reviewed by Reuters. It begins the moment Ferrigno spotted a Chevrolet Impala and followed it to the driveway next to Simmons’ house.
Cops had been searching for an armed Black man driving an Impala. Simmons was a passenger in an Impala driven by his neighbor; both are Black. Neither, however, was the man police were seeking. 
Simmons’ DNA wasn’t found on the weapon. His prints weren't on the gun. Cops never tested him for gunpowder residue. And there were no eyewitnesses and no videotape; police patrolling that part of town wouldn’t start wearing body cameras until months later. 
As he lay bleeding in his own backyard, Simmons recalled, a thought crossed his mind: If he were to die then and there, “people will never know the truth.”
What he feared seemed to be happening. Ferrigno’s version of the encounter took hold. Detectives on the case, all fellow members of the Locust Club union, dismissed Simmons’ account of that night. “No one would listen,” he recalled. “There was just one story.”
The prosecution’s case relied heavily on Ferrigno. If the jury believed him, Simmons could spend the rest of his life behind bars. He had rejected a deal to plead guilty and serve 15 years on a charge of attempted aggravated assault on a police officer: “a huge gamble,” as public defender Elizabeth Riley put it. But Simmons wanted his life back – the boys he was raising with his girlfriend, his job and a chance to prove his innocence.
By going to trial, Riley said, the Rochester Police Department was compelled to turn over records that “would not have come to light” had Simmons pleaded guilty. Those documents show the extraordinary immunity police officers enjoy from outside scrutiny, a position enjoyed by law enforcement officers across the United States. 
Reuters reviewed thousands of pages of trial transcripts, police records and other evidence submitted in People v. Simmons. The documents reveal that Ferrigno, a white officer with almost nine years’ experience, made a series of choices that run counter to widely accepted police practices. Some of those decisions, experts in police tactics told Reuters, set the stage for Ferrigno’s bloody encounter with Simmons. Other decisions likely escalated the encounter, imperiling both men’s lives.
The records also indicate that shortcuts and missteps by detectives hindered the department’s criminal and internal investigations of the shooting and may have blinded the force to flaws in the case against Simmons. The documents show the defining role that the Locust Club’s contract and union members played in the investigations. And they highlight the challenge Simmons faced when he went to trial with two public defenders battling a labor brotherhood.
“Police can shoot first and then hide behind their union and cover it up,” Simmons, who earned $17.50 an hour when he was shot, told Reuters. “All across the country, the unions stand behind the police. They hire lawyers that can beat the system. The average person they arrest doesn’t have the money to do all that.”
In America, the cops police themselves. It’s a tradition that activists in Rochester and elsewhere have been trying to change for decades. 
CULTURE OF “CALLOUSNESS” 
Rochester police officials declined to discuss details of the shooting or the investigation. But in a statement to Reuters, the department said interim Chief Cynthia Herriott-Sullivan would make any policy changes necessary to ensure use of force by officers is appropriate and investigated properly. “She looks forward to involving the community in this effort,” the statement said.
In the past, however, efforts to give residents more say over police conduct lost steam or were beaten back by the Locust Club, one of the oldest police unions in America. The union has used state collective bargaining laws to cement protections for officers. This year, it persuaded a judge to block the city’s powerful new civilian oversight board from compelling officer testimony and from disciplining cops for misconduct.
The Locust Club’s power is not unique, a nationwide Reuters analysis of police union contracts, court decisions and labor board rulings found. Labor laws, employment contracts and court rulings prevent changes in the way police are investigated and disciplined without first winning union approval, Reuters found. In some cases, even changes in operational tactics are subject to labor’s consent.
Like many American cities, Rochester is again confronting questions over the conduct of its police. In March, Daniel Prude, a Black man, died in police custody. A months-long delay in releasing video of Prude’s arrest fueled charges of a cover-up and led to the resignation of the police chief. The attorney general of New York, Letitia James, has empanelled a grand jury to consider whether the officers in the case should be criminally charged.
A September report from the city’s deputy mayor about the police handling of the Prude case identified some of the same issues that Simmons faced and referred to “a culture of insularity, acceptance, and quite frankly, callousness that permeates the Rochester Police Department.” 
Frank and Sharlene Simmons say they had similar concerns in the months leading up to their son’s trial. They joined Enough is Enough, a Rochester support group for people harmed in police encounters. The group was formed in the wake of another violent incident that involved Officer Ferrigno: the 2013 arrest of Benny Warr, a one-legged man whom officers roughed up and dumped from his wheelchair at a bus stop.
On the night Simmons was shot in 2016, Rochester cops swarmed the neighborhood, searching for witnesses and for the bullet that Ferrigno said Simmons had fired. When officers with dogs got to a white frame house a half block north of where Simmons was shot, they surrounded a van in a driveway. By coincidence, sitting inside the van was the disabled Warr, listening to the radio with his grandson. 
Warr, 60, had been terrified of cops since the 2013 incident, said his wife, Nina. He suffered back and neck injuries in the encounter, and doctors told him he would never walk with a prosthesis again, she said.
The morning after police surrounded his van, Warr heard a news report: The officer who’d shot the man a few houses away was Ferrigno, one of the cops who had roughed up Warr. 
The Rochester Police Department cleared the officers of using excessive force against Warr, and a federal jury absolved Ferrigno of liability last year after the Warrs sued. Benny Warr never got over what happened, his wife said. He was so distraught after learning Ferrigno had shot a man on his street that she took him to the hospital for psychiatric care.
Then she set out to find the family of the man Ferrigno shot. She said she wanted them to know what Ferrigno and the other officers had done to her husband.
Warr introduced herself to Simmons’ parents at an Enough is Enough meeting and referred them to her lawyer. The attorney, Charles Burkwit, had gathered evidence of almost two dozen misconduct complaints against Ferrigno, some alleging excessive force.
The Simmonses said they were troubled: Why had police allowed an officer with Ferrigno’s complicated history to patrol Rochester’s Lake Section? In a city with a violent crime rate twice the national average, the Lake area in 2016 had a higher number of murders, robberies and aggravated assaults than all but one other section.
Reuters was unable to review the complaints against Ferrigno because they are not public. Union leader Mazzeo said he hadn’t reviewed Ferrigno’s record either but characterized him as a “proactive” officer who was valued by his peers and by law-abiding residents in the “very, very difficult area” he patrolled. 
“The reality is, the officers who work the hardest areas … and are doing their jobs out there are going to have complaints against them,” Mazzeo said. 
""ALL SET”
Nearly five months passed before internal investigators questioned Ferrigno to examine whether his actions violated department policies. On August 23, 2016, two sergeants from the department’s Professional Standards Section, which reviews officer conduct, interviewed Ferrigno. Both sergeants were fellow Locust Club members. The session lasted about 50 minutes.
The Locust Club contract gives officers the right to have a union representative present during questioning and requires that interviews take place “at a reasonable hour” during daylight. Officers are entitled to all past reports they’ve submitted on an incident; details of the nature of the investigation; and the names and ranks of all involved – information almost never provided to other potential subjects of police scrutiny.
Almost all large cities that have signed contracts with police unions since 2016 afford officers one or more similar rights, Reuters found. 
Ferrigno told the investigators that after roll call the night of the shooting, he talked to Officer Sam Giancursio about a report Giancursio had taken a few days earlier: A woman reported being threatened by a Black man with a gun. The investigators asked Ferrigno what information he had on the suspect’s car. It was, he replied, “like a silver grayish Chevy Impala.”
Ferrigno told them he later spotted a silver Impala and followed it a few blocks until the driver backed into a residential driveway.
He said he pulled in front of the driveway with his cruiser and turned its spotlight on the Impala. “Based on what I already knew, wanted guy, gun in the vehicle, I drew my weapon and I commanded both occupants to stay in the vehicle, stay in the car, as I'm walking up to the car,” Ferrigno said. 
Simmons, who was in the passenger seat of his neighbor’s car, told Reuters he heard no such command and was blinded by the light. Unaware that the gun-wielding man charging toward him was a cop, he ran, hoping to get inside his house, he said.
Ferrigno told the sergeants that he chased Simmons toward the backyard, saw a flash and heard a bang that he believed was gunfire. He responded with four shots. Three hit Simmons. 
Almost all of the sergeants’ questions focused on this final exchange – the last few seconds of an encounter that had begun several minutes earlier.
“Why didn't you need to fire more than four times?” Sergeant Hoang Kavanaugh asked.
“I felt that that was reasonable to stop the threat at that time,” Ferrigno replied.
Later, Kavanaugh asked: “Just once again, who shot first?” 
“He shot first,” Ferrigno said.
Kavanaugh followed up: “You're allowed to defend yourself, correct?” 
“Correct.”
“I'm all set,” Kavanaugh concluded.
Part of the inquiry consisted of Ferrigno identifying 16 crime scene photographs. The transcript shows most of the questions were more elementary than probing.
“And, again, rather slowly because I realize that this is going to bring some emotions. So start off with picture No. 1,” Sergeant Michael Cotsworth instructed.
“Picture No. 1 is the suspect laying on his back in the dark backyard,” Ferrigno replied.
“And in that picture,” Cotsworth asked, “is he laying face down or face up?”
“Face up,” Ferrigno answered.
Mazzeo, the union chief, said some of the questions that sound basic may be the investigators “clarifying” their understanding of the officer’s account.
The internal investigators “do a good job,” he said. “They’re in a difficult situation. They're doing a job that has to be done, and it has to be done correctly in order for the integrity of our department.”
""IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD” 
Police who investigate their own are hindered by basic human nature, inherent conflicts of interest and, in many cities, far-reaching union contracts, policing experts say. 
“I don't care who you are, it's a natural human reaction to give a coworker the benefit of the doubt,” said Robert J. Duffy, a former beat cop who rose through the ranks to serve as chief of the Rochester Police Department from 1998 to 2005. 
Even when investigations are done well and police are in the right, “the optics alone are problematic,” said Duffy, who later served as Rochester’s mayor and New York’s lieutenant governor. “From the outside, it doesn’t look good.”
Several experts in police tactics told Reuters that by focusing on the climax of the encounter that night, the gunfire, Ferrigno’s examiners failed to explore a series of red flags that his account should have raised:
Why hadn’t Ferrigno or Giancursio alerted dispatch they were trailing a possible gunman? Why had they limited their communications with each other to a private radio channel that isn’t recorded? Why hadn’t either officer run a check of the Impala’s plates? And why did Ferrigno chase the passenger when he believed that the wanted gunman was the driver?
Each of those decisions was a missed opportunity to avoid the night’s bloody ending, said Marq Claxton, a retired New York Police Department detective who runs the Black Law Enforcement Alliance, a group that advocates for civil rights.
“The jeopardy was officer-created,” Claxton said. “The deadly force was inevitable. Why? Because he set the wheels in motion.” 
Another critical error by Ferrigno: pulling across the driveway, opening his door in front of the Impala and stepping into an unprotected field of fire. Cops are typically trained to avoid such exposure, what’s known as a “fatal funnel,” said Michael Leonesio, a former training officer for the Oakland Police Department who testifies in court as an expert on police tactics.
“That’s one of the places where officers get killed,” Leonesio said. “You have no cover, no concealment, no surprise. You pull up in front and you pop your door open. The bad guy is going to shoot you.”
In one of the few times Rochester investigators asked about the events leading up to the shooting, Ferrigno was offered this question: “What were the chances of having two silver gray Impalas that have police type body styles driving around in the same neighborhood with guns in it?” Sergeant Kavanaugh asked. “What are the odds of that, do you think?”
“Very, very rare,” Ferrigno replied.
Ferrigno had little basis for several of his assumptions. He had no way of knowing when he spotted the car whether anyone inside had a gun. His guess about who was in the car was wrong. As for the prevalence of that kind of car: In 2016, about a thousand Chevrolet Impalas were registered by residents living in that part of town, according to data provided to Reuters by Hedges & Company, an automotive market research firm. 
A week later, Rochester police located the Impala they had sought the night Simmons was shot. It wasn’t silver or grayish. It was gold.
Ferrigno later testified that he was “cleared” by the department’s review. An advisory panel of three civilians reviewed the internal investigation and concurred, the department told Reuters.
He was also honored. Top brass named him one of the department’s officers of the month for his actions that April.
A CASE UNFOLDS
Very little information about the department’s internal investigation or the officers’ conduct leading up to the confrontation was presented at the Simmons trial. The focus was on whether Simmons shot at Ferrigno. 
When testimony began October 10, 2017, Simmons had been in custody 18 months. The prosecution’s lead witnesses were Ferrigno and Giancursio. 
Ferrigno acknowledged that he never actually saw a gun in his target’s hand. After chasing Simmons up the driveway and into the darkness of a moonless night, he said he lost sight of him. Then he heard “a loud bang … like a gun going off.” Then: “a muzzle flash, or what looked to me like fire come from where his hand would be.”
“I just saw his figure light up” about 10 feet away, Ferrigno testified. He said he “returned fire.”
In a police report and in testimony before a grand jury, Giancursio never mentioned seeing a muzzle flash. But during the trial, he told jurors that he saw a flash of light and heard the “whiz” of a bullet pass by him. (He did not respond to interview requests from Reuters.)
In all, prosecutors called 28 witnesses, the defense two. Simmons chose not to testify. The case went to the jury 10 days later, on October 20, 2017. 
Of the 12 jurors, the forewoman was Hispanic, three jurors were Black and eight were white. During a week of deliberations, they asked for an easel, a flip chart and markers, a chance to re-examine exhibits such as the Ruger and readbacks of chunks of testimony. 
One was the testimony of a 52-year-old woman who lived directly across the street from the driveway that Ferrigno’s cruiser blocked. Dawn Darragh was one of the two people called by the defense. Simmons’ lawyer Riley referred to Darragh in her closing argument as “the lady who sits home all day and every time … she hears something, she gets up. She looks out. Every neighborhood has one.”
Darragh testified that bright lights drew her to her window. She saw a single officer jump out of a police car, gun drawn, and chase a man into the darkness. Then, she heard four gunshots – “pop-pop, pop-pop” – before a second officer pulled up in a separate squad car, patrol lights flashing.
Her testimony conflicted with the accounts of both officers. She heard four gunshots – the number Ferrigno alone fired. And, if the shooting happened before Giancursio arrived, as she said, the officer could not have seen a muzzle flash or heard a bullet “whiz” past.
""PER THE CUSTOMER'S INSTRUCTION”
Jurors also sought “the testimonies regarding gunshot residue in relation to defendant and clothes.”
Prosecution witness Eric Freemesser, a forensic examiner at the Monroe County Crime Lab, testified that his technicians regularly test clothing for gunpowder residue. Simmons had urged police to test his hands and clothes for residue.
Public defender Riley cross-examined Freemesser: “If he was holding a gun and fired it, could you have tested the arm of his sweatshirt to see whether or not the arm of his sweatshirt picked up any gunpowder residue?” 
“I could’ve tested that, yes,” Freemesser answered.
“But that was not done?” Riley asked.
“No, it was not,” Freemesser said. 
“And was not requested of you?”
“Correct,” Freemesser answered.
Although the magazine of the Ruger cops said they found at the scene was empty, Freemesser pointed out something odd: An empty casing remained in its chamber. When the pistol is fired, a shell casing should pop out and fall to the ground. Freemesser explained that he tested the Ruger repeatedly in the crime lab. It was in good working condition. If it had been fired that night, why was an empty casing still inside? 
Also of note: Authorities found no evidence on the Ruger or the empty shell casing inside – no DNA or fingerprints – linking Simmons to the gun. Nor could officers locate a bullet from the Ruger, despite canvassing the neighborhood. 
Perhaps the most complicated testimony jurors reviewed came from a customer support engineer for a Silicon Valley-based company paid about $130,000 a year by the Rochester Police Department. 
The company, ShotSpotter, uses audio sensors positioned around the city to try to identify and pinpoint the location of gunfire. It’s supposed to help police and paramedics improve response times. But prosecutors also have used it as they did in the Simmons trial: as evidence of the time, number and location of shots fired.
Initially, according to company records and trial testimony reviewed by Reuters, ShotSpotter told Rochester police that it identified the sounds that night as coming from a helicopter, not a gun. Then, after Rochester police told ShotSpotter the department was investigating an officer-involved shooting, the contractor reclassified the sounds as three gunshots, “per the customer’s instruction.”
After another communique from Rochester police, ShotSpotter analyzed its logs again. This time, ShotSpotter concluded that its sensors picked up four gunshots, all near Simmons’ house.
Ferrigno had himself fired four times, which fit the updated ShotSpotter analysis. But what of the shot that Ferrigno insisted Simmons fired? 
Rochester police requested another audio analysis from the contractor, court records show. The ShotSpotter report was revised once more. This time, a customer support engineer testified, sensors identified five shots – a finding that now conformed with Ferrigno’s version of events.
Simmons’ defense team had sought the original recordings and other ShotSpotter records. But the company “refused to honor the defense subpoena,” Riley disclosed in a motion. If the defense wanted the information, it would have to pay more than $10,000, court records show, “a cost that was well outside the budget of the Monroe County Public Defender's Office.” 
ShotSpotter spokeswoman Liz Einbinder said the company would not answer questions about the case because of pending litigation.
To Riley, the company’s unwillingness to supply the information was yet another example of how unfairly her client had been treated. His pleas from a hospital bed to have his clothes and hands tested for gunpowder were disregarded. And as she told jurors in her closing argument, the internal investigation that Ferrigno said “cleared” him of wrongdoing was nothing more than “cops policing cops.” 
“Think about whether or not that is a fair and impartial body,” Riley asked the jurors, “and whether or not it's relevant at all that he was cleared there.”
Late in the afternoon of October 26, jurors sent a note to the judge: They had reached a verdict. At the defense table, Simmons stiffened and prayed silently: God, don't let me go to jail for the rest of my life for something I didn’t do.

In the meeting with the ambassador, the ministry also accused Canada of not helping apprehend a Canada-based former Iranian banker wanted by Tehran for alleged financial crimes, state broadcaster IRIB said on its website.
The Canadian foreign ministry in Ottawa did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Canada broke off diplomatic relations with Iran in 2012, calling the Islamic Republic the biggest threat to global security. Iran has denied such accusations.
Strains between the two countries have risen since Iran's Revolutionary Guards acknowledged accidentally shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet on Jan. 8, mistaking the planet for a missile at a time when tensions were high between Iran and the United States.
Many of the 176 victims killed in the crash were Canadian citizens or permanent residents.

WASHINGTON/NAIROBI (Reuters) - President Donald Trump may withdraw nearly all U.S. troops from Somalia as part of a global pullback that could see major reductions in Afghanistan and a slight drawdown in Iraq, U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that nothing had been finalized and that no orders have been received by the U.S. military. However, there appeared to be a growing expectation on Tuesday that drawdown orders would be coming soon.
The Pentagon declined comment on future decisions on troop deployments. Reuters reported on Monday that Trump was expected to settle for a partial withdrawal from Afghanistan, despite promising to pull out all troops by Christmas. 
He is also expected to order a small drawdown in Iraq, from 3,000 to 2,500, U.S. officials say, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The United States has about 700 troops in Somalia focused on helping local forces defeat the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency, in a mission that receives little attention in the United States but is considered a cornerstone of the Pentagon's global efforts to combat al Qaeda.
Trump's newly-installed acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, a former Green Beret and counter-terrorism official, is taking a hard look at Somalia and could opt for keeping a minimal presence there and stop relying on large deployments to combat the group.
Critics say such a radical change in approach carries significant risk. 
Colonel Ahmed Abdullahi Sheikh, who served for three years as the commander of the Danab special forces until 2019, said any such decision to pull back would not be based on the counter-terrorism threat in Somalia and could undermine trust in the United States.
""This is being dictated by politics,"" he said.
The United States already pulled out of Bossaso and Galkayo around three weeks ago. They remain in the southern port city of Kismayo, a special forces airbase in Baledogle and in the capital Mogadishu, but a rapid pullout risks ceding ground to al Shabaab, Sheikh said.
""It would create a vacuum. The Somali security forces have good morale because of the U.S. troops … there's the possibility of air support if they are attacked, they can have medevacs,"" Sheikh said. 

Somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991, but over the past decade the African Union-backed peacekeeping force has clawed back control of the capital and large swathes of the country from al Shabaab.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has told Yemen's Houthis in high-level back channel talks it would sign a UN proposal for a nationwide ceasefire if the Iran-aligned group agrees to a buffer zone along the kingdom's borders, three sources familiar with the matter said.
If a deal is struck, it would mark the biggest breakthrough in efforts to reach a political settlement since the conflict - widely seen as a proxy war between arch-enemies Saudi Arabia and Iran - began in 2014.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged in his election campaign to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the Middle East's biggest buyer of American weapons, to pressure Riyadh to end the war that has caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
But the Houthis, who control northern Yemen and its biggest populated areas, may be less willing to cooperate with Saudi Arabia if President Donald Trump carries out threats to designate them as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) before leaving office, the sources said.
Washington and Riyadh see the Yemeni group as an extension of Iranian influence in the region.
A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis' spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
Recently the two parties, holding virtual discussions, raised the level of representation in the talks, with Mohammed Abdulsalam, the Houthis' chief negotiator, and a more senior Saudi official, two of the sources said.
Riyadh has demanded more security assurances from the Houthis, including a buffer zone along the borders with northern Yemen until a U.N.-backed transitional government is formed, the sources said. 
Riyadh wants Houthi forces to leave a corridor along the Saudi borders to prevent incursions and artillery fire.
In exchange, the kingdom would ease an air and sea blockade as part of the U.N. proposal for a ceasefire, which already includes an end to cross-border attacks.
Last year, Riyadh launched indirect talks with the Houthis, as it seeks a way out of the conflict that has drawn criticism from Biden, killed tens of thousands of people and tarnished the reputation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The talks have stalled over the last two months, the sources said, as fighting escalated in the gas-rich region of Marib, where the Houthis have launched an offensive to drive out Saudi-backed forces.
Marib is the last stronghold of the internationally-recognised government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which was ousted from power in the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthis in late 2014.
That prompted the Saudi-led coalition, which also includes the United Arab Emirates, to intervene.
Complicating matters, the fighting fragmented, spawning a multi-layered war that has lasted nearly six years.
'CONSULTATIONS ON IRAN'
Trump's administration, to support the Saudis, has exerted pressure on the Houthis by threatening to designate the group as a terrorist organisation, said two of the three sources, who declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Any decision by Washington to blacklist the Houthis, part of its ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Tehran, would be ""devastating"" after years of peace efforts led by U.N. Special Envoy Martin Griffiths and other Western ambassadors, they added.
One of the sources said that experts in the U.S. administration have advised Trump against an FTO designation.
The State Department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The discreet talks between the kingdom and the Houthis have dragged on for more than a year, in parallel with Griffiths' efforts to reach an agreement on a ceasefire.
The U.N. is working to secure a face-to-face meeting before the end of the year, as well as an agreement on a joint declaration that would halt all air, ground and naval hostilities, two of the sources said.

Europe would be a logical venue for them to meet, one of the sources said, as the U.N. seeks neutral grounds for the talks. Griffith's office declined to comment.

The Lebanese government ordered the two-week restrictions, including a 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew on Sundays, as new daily infections rose above 1,000. 
Lebanon reported 1,016 new infections on Monday, bringing its total to 106,446 cases and 827 deaths since Feb. 21.
After city streets and roads emptied on Sunday, pedestrians were back on Monday and some motorists could be seen flouting a re-imposed odd-even licence plate alternate day driving rule.

""Besides corona(virus), we have another crisis, the bank crisis. You can't completely shut down because if you do, there are people who work on a daily basis, what do you do with them?""

BRIDGETOWN (Reuters) - Barbados removed the statue of British Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson from the capital Bridgetown's main square on Monday, two months after announcing plans to replace Britain's Queen Elizabeth as its head of state and move on from its colonial past.The bronze statue was unveiled in 1813 to commemorate Nelson and the British Royal Navy's victory over the French and Spanish in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. 
The Caribbean, then largely colonised by Britain, France and Spain, was also an important battleground in the Napoleonic Wars and the ruling-classes and plantation elite had the statue erected to mark his role in the campaigns.
But the statue has been targeted for removal by various administrations since 1990 as a vestige of colonial rule, made even more controversial because of Nelson's defence of the slave trade upon which Barbados' plantation economy was based.
The square where it stood was originally called Trafalgar Square but was renamed National Heroes Square in 1999, although Nelson is not on the list of Barbados' 10 National Heroes.But it took the global reassessment of history and racism triggered by the killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer in May this year, to prompt the government into action.At a ceremony on Monday night, Prime Minister Mia Mottley said the government accepted the statue was an ""important, historic relic"".But she said: ""It is not a relic to be placed in the National Heroes Square of a nation that has had to fight for too long to shape its destiny and to forge a positive future for its citizens.""In a May 1805 letter to his friend Simon Taylor in Jamaica, retired Barbados Community College history tutor Trevor Marshall noted, Nelson wrote that ""I have ever been, and shall die, a firm friend of our present Colonial system"".
He went on to denounce ""the damnable doctrine"" of abolitionists of the day like William Wilberforce.Nelson was killed on the deck of his flagship HMS Victory by a French sniper at the Battle of Trafalgar off Spain in October that same year. Two years later, Britain abolished the slave trade.""If Nelson had been alive, the end of slavery would have come even later,"" Marshall said.
After decades of overlooking Bridgetown's principal thoroughfare, the Nelson statue will be housed at the Barbados Museum in the Historic Garrison Area.
It joins a number of other statues across the globe, including slave traders in Britain to Confederate generals in the United States, to have been hauled down as the Black Lives Matter campaign gathered momentum. 
The famous statue of Nelson in Trafalgar Square in London - erected about 30 years after the Barbados one - has also been targeted by activists for removal. 
Barbados was claimed for England in 1625 and became independent after more than three centuries of colonial rule in 1966. Its present day population of about 287,000 people are moslty the descendants of African slaves brought over to work the plantations.
Moves are underway now for Barbados to ditch Queen Elizabeth as its head of state and to become a republic before the 55th anniversary of its independence next year.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the devolution of powers to Scotland ""a disaster"", a comment that played into the hands of Scottish nationalists pushing for an independence referendum that opinion polls suggest they could win.
The bonds holding the United Kingdom together have been severely strained over the last five years by Brexit and the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 14 recent polls have shown a majority of Scots now support independence.
In a video call on Friday with northern English lawmakers from his Conservative Party, Johnson said that devolution, introduced by Tony Blair had been the former prime minister's ""biggest mistake"" and ""a disaster"", media reported.
He also said he saw no case for giving Scotland's semi-autonomous government and parliament, which are dominated by the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), any further powers in addition to the ones they hold now.
Johnson's office did not deny the comments.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, jumped on them, arguing that the Conservatives' public statements of support for devolution were duplicitous.
""Worth bookmarking these PM comments for the next time Tories (Conservatives) say they're not a threat to the powers of the Scottish Parliament - or, even more incredibly, that they support devolving more powers,"" she said on Twitter.
Independence is the only way to protect and strengthen the Scottish parliament, she added.
In a sign of the nervousness that Johnson's comments caused among Scots who support staying part of the United Kingdom, the Conservative leader in Scotland, Douglas Ross, immediately contradicted the prime minister.
""Devolution has not been a disaster,"" he said on Twitter. ""The SNP's non-stop obsession with another referendum - above jobs, schools and everything else - has been a disaster.""
SECOND REFERENDUM?
Scottish voters rejected independence by 55 to 45 percent in a 2014 referendum, but since then the SNP have become stronger, winning all elections in Scotland by huge margins. They are expected to perform strongly in elections to Scottish parliament in Holyrood in May. Sturgeon is pushing for a second referendum.
In the 2016 Brexit referendum, England and Wales voted to leave the European Union but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain. Due to the much greater size of England's population, the overall result was a win for Brexit. 
This was galling for many Scots, because one of the central arguments put forward in favour of remaining in the United Kingdom in their own 2014 referendum was that it was the only way for Scotland to remain part of the European bloc.
In an attempt to defuse the row caused by Johnson's comments, the housing minister Robert Jenrick said it was not realistic to demand a second referendum.
""Any politician who wanted to hold a referendum on a topic like this, at this moment in time, is frankly mad,"" he said, accusing the SNP of prioritising their cause above the fight against COVID-19 and the economic damage it has caused.

However, polls suggest that Scots have a more favourable view of how Sturgeon and her administration have handled the pandemic than the rest of the country has of how Johnson's government has performed.

Police fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse protesters who tried to march through the capital Athens, disregarding the ban which the government said was vital to protect public health during a pandemic.
Leftist and Communist opposition parties slammed the decision as ""authoritarian"".
Earlier in the day, police did not intervene as dozens of Communist KKE party members wearing masks and heeding social distancing rules held a separate rally in the centre of Athens to mark the uprising anniversary. 
In the morning, Greece's president, political parties and citizens laid a wreath and flowers at the empty Athens Polytechnic University to honour the dozens killed during the student revolt near the end of the junta's 1967-74 rule. 
On a day like this in any other year, the campus in central Athens would be teeming with people queuing to pay homage to those killed in the uprising, a defining moment in modern Greek history. But the coronavirus pandemic changed things.
Greece registered a further 2,198 cases and 58 deaths on Monday, its second highest daily death toll so far. 
Greece fared better than other European countries in the first wave of the pandemic last spring due to an early lockdown. But a surge in cases since early October has forced authorities to impose a second, nationwide lockdown which expires at the end of November.
Public gatherings of more than four people are banned until Nov. 18, according to police, and violators face fines of up to 5,000 euros ($5,928).
More than 5,000 police were deployed in central Athens on Tuesday while a helicopter hovered overhead through the day.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on European leaders to impose targeted economic sanctions on supporters of President Alexander Lukashenko after police stepped up violence against protesters.
Police in Minsk used tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse tens of thousands of demonstrators on Sunday, on the fourteenth straight weekend of protests since a disputed presidential election on Aug. 9 that Lukashenko says he won.
Germany and the European Union are looking into ways to increase pressure on the Belarusian leadership after the Sunday crackdown, and the death last week of a 31-year-old anti-government protester after what demonstrators said was a severe beating by security forces.
Tsikhanouskaya, who fled to Vilnius in Lithuania after the vote which she says she won, urged the European Union to move towards ""targeted financial sanctions against people and individuals who are in the pockets of Lukashenko"".
""Only economical pressure will make this regime step away, because they will not have money to pay for riot police and their crimes,"" she told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday during a visit to Stockholm.
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics tweeted on Monday that his country will soon, together with Lithuania and Estonia, expand sanctions on Belarus officials ""to include those who continue to violently suppress peaceful protests"".
Tsikhanouskaya described the people in Belarus as being ""in desperation"" in face of the crackdown. ""Our protest movement is principally peaceful, and we don't want to answer violence with violence.""
Russia had not answered opposition calls for dialogue, she said, adding that she understands Moscow is no longer an enthusiastic supporter of Lukashenko. 

""They have not spoken about the situation in Belarus so much, they do not show great support to him, they are waiting to see what's going on there"", she said.

680,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>","Special Report: A city takes on its police union, and a nation is watching","By Lisa Girion and Reade Levinson
ROCHESTER, New York (Reuters) - People who know Silvon Simmons call him “Tugg,” a nickname his parents gave him after he pried apart the slats of his crib and squeezed his way out. Now, as he stood accused of trying to kill a cop, his fate was in the hands of 12 strangers.
It was October 26, 2017, and jurors filed into the Monroe County courtroom in what seemed to Simmons like slow motion. Some caught his gaze and quickly looked away.
Now 36, Simmons had put everything on the line for this moment. He had refused a plea deal and spent 18 months in jail awaiting trial, even though losing could mean life in prison.
His body still carried two bullets from the night in April 2016 when a Rochester police officer shot him three times from behind. The cop, Joseph Ferrigno, insisted that Simmons fired at him first. Ferrigno was not wounded in the encounter.
“Would the foreperson please rise,” the clerk said. “In the matter of the People of the State of New York versus Silvon Simmons, as defendant, in the first count in the indictment, attempted aggravated murder, how do you find the defendant, guilty or not guilty?”
“Not guilty.”
Three more charges remained. But Simmons’ relief was so palpable, it looked as though he might faint, one juror told Reuters.
Count 2: Attempted aggravated assault of a police officer. “Not guilty.”
Count 3: Criminal possession of a weapon with the intent to use it unlawfully. “Not guilty.”
They didn’t believe these lying ass police! Simmons thought. I’m ready to hug all those jurors.
And then, Count 4: Criminal possession of a weapon not in the home or place of business.
“Guilty.”
Simmons was stunned. The count wasn’t as serious as the first two but still carried up to 15 years in prison. Judge Christopher Ciaccio ordered him freed pending his sentencing. Dizzied by what had just happened, Simmons couldn’t speak. Instead, he showed his acknowledgment by rapping his knuckles on the defense table.
He had hoped to clear his name. He came close. With no prior felonies, he’d probably get the minimum 3-1/2-year sentence, his lawyer Elizabeth Riley told him.
As it turned out, Riley was wrong.
“LIVES CAN BE RUINED”
While Simmons sat in jail awaiting trial, activists in this city in northwest New York renewed their efforts to expose and change police practices they considered unfair.
They would run into the same obstacle Simmons had: a blue wall. Backed by a strong police union and state labor laws, police in Rochester had fended off efforts since the 1960s to give community members more say in how officers are disciplined and how they do their jobs.
As the Simmons case played out, community members championing change would initiate the strongest drive yet to gain substantial civilian oversight of the police department. Success would mean clawing back power the city lost to the union during decades of labor negotiations and legal battles.
Rochester’s city council is now fighting the union in court over that effort. If it wins, the case could set a legal precedent for other municipalities in New York – and serve as a national model for civilian oversight.
In February 2017, almost a year after Simmons was shot, advocates issued a study using Rochester Police Department data on investigations of 1,173 civilian complaints that alleged excessive force. The study found that the department faulted officers in just 3% of cases – and fired none.
The authors contended that the Locust Club, the police union, essentially controlled how discipline was handled through its contract with the city.
“Police policing police is codified,” the study concluded. “Lives can be ruined by a single decision of a police officer. Yet the police are not accountable to the public who pay their salaries.”
""HOW POWERFUL ARE WE?""
That conclusion could not be more wrong, said Michael Mazzeo, president of the police union. Discipline is decided by the chief, who serves at the pleasure of the mayor and is susceptible to political influence, he said.
“I hear all the time how powerful the union is, but I can’t get someone hired, and I can't prevent someone getting fired,” Mazzeo said. “So how powerful are we?”
Mazzeo said the study relied on faulty and incomplete information that led to flawed conclusions. During the last 10 or 15 years, Mazzeo said, he was aware of at least 10 officers who retired or were fired after a department investigation.
Reuters could not verify Mazzeo’s tally. At the time of the Simmons trial, a New York law known as “50-A” barred the disclosure of police personnel files. This June, state lawmakers repealed 50-A in an effort to improve accountability and trust in police. Some unions are fighting the disclosures in court.
In examining 100 police union contracts in some of America’s largest cities, Reuters found that officers in almost half of them, including Rochester, don’t need judicial intervention to keep certain personnel files secret. Their contracts mandate that police departments purge or seal officer disciplinary records, in some jurisdictions within six months.
That makes identifying troubled cops difficult for police chiefs who want to retrain or dismiss them, and for federal authorities seeking to investigate patterns of abuse within a police department.
Scores of cities across America have tried to exert more authority over their police. But they have been stymied, largely by obstacles beyond their control: state labor laws that govern collective bargaining. In most states, such laws and court rulings bar cities from making changes without union approval.
As Rochester’s leaders considered how and whether to move forward, Silvon Simmons prepared to return to court for sentencing. 
“IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE”
Riley, his public defender, had found the jury’s verdict perplexing. Jurors had decided that Simmons was carrying a Ruger pistol the night he was shot by Officer Ferrigno. The pistol, police said, was found feet from where Simmons lay bleeding. Riley struggled to understand the jury’s conclusion.
Neither Simmons’ DNA nor fingerprints were on the gun or on an empty shell casing inside the Ruger’s chamber. A trace on the pistol found no link to Simmons. Searches of his car, his house, the Impala he rode in the night he was shot all failed to turn up anything of significance.
In their first public comments, several jurors told Reuters that the gun possession verdict was a compromise to help Simmons avoid a worse fate. When deliberations began, they said, the jury was split roughly along racial lines over whether Simmons, a Black man, had tried to kill Ferrigno, a white officer.
Ultimately, the jurors said, they didn’t believe Simmons had fired at the cop. But they were confused about the origins of the gun that officers said they found near Simmons.
From the outset, Ralph Hay, a General Motors (NYSE:GM) machinist serving on his first jury, said he knew Simmons hadn’t tried to kill a cop in his own backyard. Not with his family inside the house, and not with a gun that, according to cops, had just one bullet. “Are you asking to die?” Hay, one of three Black jurors, told Reuters. “It doesn’t make any sense.”
Robert Marcell, a retired operations manager for the company that made Rochester famous, Eastman Kodak, said he believed Ferrigno had been startled by something, but not by a gunshot.
“Not to say he was lying,” said Marcell, one of the eight white jurors, “but he was mistaken.”
Testimony by another Rochester officer, Sam Giancursio, “about having a bullet go past his ear was kind of unbelievable,” Marcell said. “The story just didn’t hang together.”
Marcell said the jury included at least two gun owners who understood firearms. They convinced several others that the Ruger – with an empty casing in the chamber – had not been fired that night.
“WE WERE PISSED OFF”
The failure of the police to find a bullet from the Ruger added to the skepticism. The thinking was that Simmons threw the gun down and ran away, Marcell said. “I don't think the gun went off.”
Other jurors had problems with that notion: If Simmons had tossed the gun, why wasn’t his DNA found on it? And why hadn’t authorities tested his shirt or palms for gunpowder residue, as Simmons requested?
“We were pissed off as citizens that this guy was pleading to have the gunshot residue tested, but it wasn’t done,” said Joseph D’Angelo, a white lawyer who served on the jury. “That was huge for us, the fact that there was no physical evidence.”
Jurors also lost confidence in evidence from ShotSpotter, an acoustic detection company under contract with the Rochester Police Department that reported picking up the sounds of five gunshots, Marcell said.
“The more we peeled away the layers of the onion,” he said, “the harder it became to believe.”
ShotSpotter revised its analysis of the sounds it recorded that night several times after hearing from Rochester police. Neither the company nor the police department would discuss the findings with Reuters.
A JURY'S BARGAIN
Jurors considered the possibility that the gun was planted, said D’Angelo, who does research for Westlaw, the legal information service owned by  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI). But, in the end, he said, they dismissed the idea as just “too conspiracy-like.”
“We couldn’t figure out how the hell the cops could have planted it,” D’Angelo said.
So, how did the gun get there? Some jurors believed Simmons must have brought it. In the end, the group voted to convict Simmons on one of the lesser gun possession charges. They believed – wrongly – that it didn’t carry a sentence much longer than the 18 months he already had served. And after two weeks of testimony, some were exhausted and ready to go home and get back to work, jurors said.
Hay remembered it as a bargain to protect Simmons. He was afraid that if the jury couldn't reach a verdict, the judge would declare a mistrial. If so, a new group of jurors would be asked to judge Simmons and possibly put an innocent man behind bars for life.
“It was definitely a deal,” Hay said. “I didn’t want to throw everything away. There was no telling that there was going to be people like us on the next jury.”
The verdict seemed to satisfy no one. Simmons faced years behind bars. And Rochester police were appalled that he had beaten the more serious charge of trying to kill a cop.
“RAGE IN MY HEART”
Police solidarity was front and center on January 11, 2018, the day of Simmons’ sentencing hearing. Rochester cops – Ferrigno and union head Mazzeo among them – packed the courtroom.
The week before, Ferrigno sent a letter to the judge. Simmons, he wrote, “acted like an outlaw and an uncivilized human being, and he could have gotten somebody killed or seriously injured.” Ferrigno urged the judge to show “no leniency” in sentencing Simmons.
“It puts pure anger and rage in my heart knowing that I was almost taken away from my family,” he wrote.
Judge Ciaccio also received more than two dozen letters on behalf of Simmons: friends, coworkers and relatives vouching for his character, his honesty, his love of family and his compassion.
None of the letters mattered. Instead, Ciaccio turned to the law.
Simmons’ lawyers had filed a motion asking the judge to set aside the conviction, arguing that there were grounds for reversal on appeal. Such motions are routine and typically dismissed. But Judge Ciaccio stunned those in the courtroom: The gun possession conviction, he ruled, was a mistake.
A “FUNDAMENTAL ERROR”
Ciaccio had come to view the ShotSpotter evidence as flawed, he explained. The Silicon Valley contractor claimed to have detected five sounds at the scene of the shooting that it identified as gunfire. “Most troubling,” the judge said, was that ShotSpotter had erased all but an eight-second clip of its audio recording.
Not knowing the sounds before and after made it impossible to determine that the impulses were gunshots, the judge said. “It may have been a series of shots, may have been a series of backfires, it may have been some other acoustic impulse.”
Absent that evidence, Ciaccio said, he did not believe the jury would have convicted Simmons. Therefore, he set aside the conviction, correcting a “fundamental error.”
In an order issued later, Ciaccio wrote that ""the jury’s verdict reflected a nearly complete rejection"" of the officers' version of events. It ""reflected a determination that the defendant did not point his gun at Ferrigno and fire it. No bullet whizzed by Giancursio's head.""
A news camera captured Simmons’ shock – and heckles from the gallery packed with police. “You do the devil’s work,” someone told public defender Riley. The lawyer, who is much smaller than Simmons, put her arm around him as if to shield him as she heard someone warn, “Watch your back next time.”
The Monroe County District Attorney’s office declined to answer questions about its prosecution of Simmons, saying it does not discuss cases in which defendants are cleared and the records are, by law, sealed.
FIGHT CONTINUES
The Locust Club is again fighting on a familiar front. Last year, it sued the Rochester City Council in state court to prevent a new citizen Police Accountability Board from policing the police.
The board grew out of a movement that gained ground after the Simmons trial. At the urging of community groups, the council voted unanimously to hold a referendum on creating the board. With more than 75% of the vote last November, Rochester approved what may become the most powerful civilian oversight body in the United States.
Voters approved the creation of the all-volunteer, no-cops-allowed panel to investigate complaints against police and examine department practices.
The Locust Club sued. A state judge found in its favor, ruling that by empowering the accountability board to compel officers to testify and to discipline them, the city had violated the police union contract and state collective bargaining laws. Those laws require cities to negotiate with all public employee unions over any changes to employment conditions. The city council is appealing.
As they await a ruling, the taxpayer-funded panel’s first nine members have elected a chairwoman and begun developing policies for investigating complaints against officers and examining police practices.
CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT
Such boards can have enduring impact, policing experts say. They can alter the way police shootings and other violent encounters are investigated. The most significant changes: The accountability board’s investigators – not just fellow police union members – would be in a position to question officers about their decisions, and the board could overrule the findings of internal police inquiries.
“We will listen to our own witnesses, gather evidence and have a team of investigators working with us,” said Chairwoman Shani Wilson. “We would then make rulings based on that.”
The board would set the scope of its investigations, allowing for more thorough examinations of the tactics and policies at play in any encounter and, potentially, make recommendations for improvements.
Internal police investigations tend to focus narrowly on the final moments of a violent encounter, said John Alden, executive director of the Community Police Review Agency in Oakland, California. But civilian overseers, Alden said, are more likely to question why officers behaved the way they did in the crucial 20 to 30 minutes before a shooting.
Among the questions a review board might ask about an encounter such as Ferrigno’s with Simmons: Were there red flags in Ferrigno’s personnel record that suggested he needed more training – or that he shouldn’t have been riding solo in a car in the Lake Section of Rochester, where gunplay and violent crime were common? And were there steps he could have taken to de-escalate the encounter?
Alden’s agency in Oakland is one of the strongest civilian oversight boards in the country because it can issue subpoenas to compel police officers and other witnesses to answer questions.
SETTING A PRECEDENT
Rochester voters took that model a step further, giving their Police Accountability Board both subpoena power and the final say on discipline – a prerogative that has belonged to the chief.
“That’s a huge responsibility,” said Wilson, chairwoman of the new board. “We are setting a precedent for the rest of the country.”
First, the Rochester City Council must win its appeal.
The council is pinning its hopes on recent New York State court rulings that its lawyer argues give local elected officials the authority to decide how police should be policed. In each case – in Orangetown, Wallkill and Schenectady – unions challenged the municipality’s power to discipline officers. In each case, the union lost.
Other cities and towns are watching Rochester closely. If Rochester wins, municipalities across New York can attempt to apply the same legal strategy in pursuing police oversight, and the board could become a model around the state and the country.
In a brief filed in support of Rochester, the city of Kingston told the appellate court that it needs the power to enact changes by ordinance because its efforts to win at the bargaining table have been thwarted by an intransigent union. The cities of Middletown and Hudson (NYSE:HUD) also weighed in: If the Locust Club defeats the accountability board, they wrote, it would have a “significant and detrimental impact” on reform efforts across New York.
The Rochester City Council is pushing forward despite the mounting cost of the litigation. “We don’t have limitless funds, but we’re willing to invest some level of local resources,” Council President Loretta Scott told Reuters. “It’s just too important to stop now.”
A CITY'S FUTURE
Both union head Mazzeo and Simmons say they worry about what comes next for Rochester.
Mazzeo fears that the anti-police mood threatens public safety. Police spend years training for a complicated, dangerous and often thankless job, Mazzeo said, “and they will make mistakes.” But if the consequence of a mistake is to “simply just terminate people,” then a job that requires calm nerves and sound judgment will fail to draw the caliber of candidates needed.
“How is that doing a service to the public?” Mazzeo asked.
Simmons also fears for Rochester. He said he worries the Locust Club may succeed at keeping its 700 members insulated from oversight.
He is again taking on the police in court, this time in a civil lawsuit. It alleges the department fabricated evidence to cover up Ferrigno’s mistake. In response, city attorneys denied the allegations and called Ferrigno’s conduct “justified under the circumstances” and “in accordance with the requirements of the law.” The suit is pending.
Rochester police officials said department rules prohibited the officers involved, including Ferrigno, from speaking about the incident. When Ferrigno can comment, Mazzeo said, “he’s going to tell you he’s innocent” of any wrongdoing.
“It is important to note that Officer Ferrigno has been out on disability leave since the incident and has not been serving as an officer on our streets,” the department said in a statement to Reuters. Ferrigno testified he was sidelined by post-traumatic stress. Records show the city has continued paying him: $80,704 this year.
Ferrigno has applied for a medical retirement, the department said. Mazzeo said he doubts Ferrigno will ever work as a cop again. In his letter to the judge, Ferrigno hinted at the toll the shooting has taken on him and his family. He also wrote of his fear: that Simmons might one day try to “retaliate against me and my family.”
Simmons has a similar fear: that Rochester police may try to retaliate against him.
“I SURVIVED”
Like Ferrigno, Simmons also suffers lasting consequences. The bullets in his pelvis and chest still hurt him when he moves. He walks with a hitch to avoid aggravating his damaged sciatic nerve. He can’t bend his left toes anymore, and that foot is always cold.
Yet Simmons said he’s upbeat about his own future. His relationship with his girlfriend didn’t survive his 18 months in jail, but he’s trying to make up for lost time with his boys. He can no longer lift the heavy air conditioning equipment he once delivered. But the company where he worked before the shooting rehired him as a salesman.
“I got shot and was supposed to die, but I survived,” he said. “I went to jail and was supposed to be there for the rest of my life, but I got out.”
Still, he remains skeptical about the future of policing in his hometown.

“Everything I said turned out to be true,” Simmons said. “And everything they said turned out to be a lie.”

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani Islamist group called off protests over cartoons of Prophet Mohammad on Tuesday saying the government had agreed to their demand for a boycott of French products, the group's spokesman said.
Thousands of Islamists had clashed with police on the edge of the capital, Islamabad, on Monday in protests over the recent display of cartoons of the Prophet in France.
""We are calling off our protests after the government signed an agreement that it will officially endorse boycotting French products,"" Ejaz Ashrafi, a spokesman for the Tehrik-i-Labaik group, told Reuters by telephone. 
The government spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the agreement, which, according to a copy provided by the group and seen by Reuters, was signed by two ministers, a top official and the group's leaders.
The French embassy in Islamabad declined to comment and Pakistan's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
Protests broke out in several Muslim countries over France's response to a deadly attack last month on a teacher who showed cartoons mocking the Prophet Mohammad to pupils during a civics lesson. 
For Muslims, depictions of the Prophet are blasphemous.
Pakistan condemned the re-printing of the cartoons.
The agreement between the group and the government also stipulated that the Pakistani parliament would decide within three months on whether to expel the French ambassador.
Also, all detained protesters and their leaders would be set free immediately, the spokesman said, shortly after he was released. 
The Islamist group that has made blasphemy its rallying cry had blocked one of the main roads into the capital, demanding the government sever diplomatic ties with France and expel its ambassador.
Pakistani trade with France was valued at nearly $800 million in the last financial year, according to central bank data, with $422 million worth of exports and imports valued at $356 million.
There is a history of violent reactions to perceived incidents of blasphemy in Pakistan, where insulting the Prophet Mohammad carries the death penalty. A mere accusation of blasphemy can provoke a lynching.

The Islamist group called off a similar protest in 2017, in which one police and six protesters were killed, after the government agreed to its demands, which included the resignation of the then law minister.

""Any action against the Iranian nation would certainly face a crushing response,"" spokesman Ali Rabiei said, in remarks streamed on an official government website.
Citing a U.S. official, Reuters reported on Monday that Trump, with two months left in office, conferred with top advisers about the possibility of attacking the Natanz uranium enrichment plant - but was dissuaded by them from that option.
One of the advisers named in the report, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is on Wednesday due to visit Israel, which has long hinted at possible military action against its arch-enemy Iran.
""If I were the Iranians, I would not feel at ease"" after the report, Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said, adding that he was not aware of the Oval Office deliberations last Thursday. 
""It is very important that the Iranians know that if, indeed, they suddenly dash toward high levels of enrichment, in the direction of nuclear weaponry, they are liable to encounter the military might of the United States - and also, perhaps, of other countries,"" Steinitz told Israel's Army Radio. 
Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful needs. Rabiei accused Israel of ""psychological warfare"" against Iran.

""I personally don't foresee that it's probable that they (the United States) would want to cause insecurity in the world and the region,"" Rabiei said.

It was unclear who was behind the attack.
""A blast occurred at a restaurant near School Policio (police academy),"" police spokesman Sadik Ali told reporters in a WhatsApp message group shortly after the blast went off.
Later he told Reuters six people, including the perpetrator, had died in the bombing.
A witness, shopkeeper Mohamed Ali, told Reuters police opened fire after the blast went off.
He said he could see huge clouds of smoke rising above the restaurant and ambulances trying to reach the site, in the city's Hamar Jajab district near Mogadishu port.
Another witness, Mohamud Ahmed, told Reuters heavy rain had sent a lot of people into the restaurant to seek shelter.
""As I was sipping tea and looking down, (a) blast occurred. From there I don't know what happened,"" he said. His legs, hands and head had been hit by shrapnel from the explosion, which he said had also given him concussion.
Al Qaeda-allied Islamist group al Shabaab frequently carries out bombings in Mogadishu and elsewhere in Somalia as part of its campaign to topple the central government.
The group wants to establish its own rule in the Horn of African country based on its own strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law.

The Reciprocal Access Agreement strengthens defence ties between the two U.S. allies at a time when China is asserting its role in the region and the United States is going through a leadership transition.
A legal framework allowing Japanese and Australian troops to visit each other's countries and conduct training and joint operations, it was agreed in principle by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and his Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison, who is visiting Tokyo. 
""In the Indo-Pacific region, security and defence cooperation between Japan and Australia, which have the will and capacity to contribute to regional peace and stability, is becoming increasingly important,"" Suga told a joint news conference.
""I hereby announce that we reached agreement in principle on a reciprocal access agreement, which had been negotiated to elevate security and defence cooperation between Japan and Australia to a new level."" 
It will be Japan's first agreement covering foreign military presence on its soil since a status of forces agreement in 1960 that allowed the United States to base warships, fighter jets and thousands of troops in and around Japan as part of an alliance that Washington describes as the bedrock of regional security.
""Our special strategic partnership became even stronger, in particular because today we have taken a significant step forward in Japan and Australia reaching in principle agreement on landmark defence treaty, the Reciprocal Access Agreement,"" Morrison said.

A quarter of a century after the U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace
accords ended the war among Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) in which about 100,000 people were killed, many suspected war criminals are still at large in the ethnically divided country.
Dusan Culibrk, 50, is accused of taking part in the killing of 44 Bosniak and Croat civilians who were taken in July 1992 for exchange from the notorious Omarska camp for non-Serbs, where they were illegally detained.
Culibrk, who was a member of the Serb-run reserve police force in the town of Bosanska Krupa, along with others brought the group to the site of the Lisac pit and shot them, the prosecution said.
The remains of the victims were found and exhumed from the pit in 2000, when they were also identified.
Culibrk is in addition accused of intercepting a group of seven Bosniak civilians from Prijedor on their way to the western town of Bihac, and killing them. Their remains were also found in the Lisac mass grave, the prosecution said. 
Culibrk is investigated for the war crimes against civilians, just as Milorad Kotur from Bosanska Krupa, who was questioned in Serbia where he currently resides, the prosecution said.
Omarska was one of four Serb-run detention camps in the northern Prijedor area, in which about 7,000 Bosniaks and Croats were held and tortured and hundreds killed, as part of the Bosnian Serb operation to ""ethnically cleanse"" the areas slated for their exclusive Serb state.
Dozens of thousands of Bosniaks and Coats were persecuted from the Prijedor area, and thousands found in mass graves after the war ended. Several thousand people are still missing.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai police blasted protesters with water cannon and used teargas on Tuesday, hurting several people in a bid to push back a demonstration at parliament demanding constitutional changes that would touch on the powerful monarchy.
Protesters are demanding changes to the constitution drawn up by a former junta. They also want the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army ruler, and reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Police sprayed water cannon at protesters who tried to cut their way through razor-wire barricades. Then they fired teargas at the hundreds of demonstrators.
Ambulances ferried the injured to hospital. Bangkok's Erawan Medical Center said five people were hospitalised due to teargas and others were treated at the scene. 
""This is brutal,"" said a 31-year-old volunteer with the FreeYouth protest group who gave his name as Oh. The group posted pictures of riot police on Twitter with the caption ""Dictator's lackeys!""
Police declared that protests were banned within 50 metres of the area.
""Protesters tried to break through the barricades to enter the restricted area,"" police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen told reporters.
Lawmakers were discussing several proposals for the way in which the constitution can be amended - some of which would exclude the possibility of changes to the way King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy is treated under the constitution.
There is also discussion of the role of the upper house Senate, which was entirely selected by Prayuth's former junta and helped ensure that he kept power with a parliamentary majority after a disputed election last year. Prayuth says the vote was fair.
Opposition parliamentarians have also called for changes to the constitution.
Protests that picked up in July initially targeted Prayuth and constitutional change but have since called for the monarch's role to be more clearly accountable under the constitution and for the reversal of changes that gave the current king personal control of the royal fortune and some army units.
Before the anti-government protesters reached parliament, several hundred royalists gathered there to urge lawmakers not to make changes to the constitution.
""Amending the constitution is going to lead to the abolition of the monarchy,"" royalist leader Warong Dechgitvigrom told reporters.

Protesters have said they do not want to abolish the monarchy.

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - The Donald Trump era may be coming to an end. But European Union ministers meeting this week to discuss the future of the continent's defence will say the lesson has been learned: Europe needs to be strong enough to fight on its own.
EU foreign and defence ministers meeting by teleconference on Thursday and Friday will receive the bloc's first annual report on joint defence capabilities, expected to serve as the basis for a French-led, post-Brexit, post-Trump effort to turn the EU into a stand-alone military power.
President-elect Joe Biden will halt his predecessor's confrontational rhetoric towards allies, but he is not going to alter the underlying U.S. message that Europe needs to contribute more to its own defence, European diplomats say.
""We aren't in the old status quo, where we can pretend that the Donald Trump presidency never existed and the world was the same as four years ago,"" a French diplomat said.
An EU official said Biden's victory was ""a call to Europe to keep building a common EU defence, to be a useful and a strong ally, also for the NATO alliance.""
The EU has been working since December 2017 to develop more firepower independently of the United States. The effort has been driven mainly by France, the EU's remaining major military power after Brexit.
During Britain's membership, London tended to resist a major military role for the EU, putting an emphasis instead on NATO as the main forum for European defence. Its exit gives Paris an opportunity to push longstanding ambitions for a bigger EU role in defence, with more cautious support from Berlin.
""The United States will only respect us as allies if we are serious about our own position, and if we have our own sovereignty regarding our defence,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a magazine interview on Sunday.
Trump was openly hostile to NATO, routinely criticising European countries for spending too little on defence and describing allies that spend less than 2% of national output as ""delinquent"". But previous U.S. administrations also called on Europe to spend more.
In a joint column for European and U.S. media on Monday, the French and German foreign ministers said they were committed to ""make the transatlantic partnership more balanced"".
The EU's Coordinated Annual Review on Defence is expected to identify a lack of drone technology, ageing aircraft and duplication of weaponry across EU members.
FRANCO-GERMAN TENSIONS
The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell told EU ambassadors privately late last week that the EU needs to ""practice the language of power, not just speak it"".
While the EU is already at work on joint projects and will put aside 8 billion euros ($9.46 billion) from next year for a weapons development fund, the bloc needs at least a decade to have any military independence from Washington, experts say.
Differences between France and Germany are also emerging, with Berlin seen as more sceptical of initiatives outside of NATO. Germany's Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said Europeans cannot hope to replace the U.S. defensive nuclear weapons system.

France, meanwhile, has been waging war in northwest Africa's Sahel region for several years in what it sees as an operation to defend Europe's southern flank from Islamist extremism. It has so far had only limited success persuading other European countries to join the mission.

The test, conducted on Nov 16, involved an Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense-equipped destroyer which the MDA did not identify.
""We have demonstrated that an Aegis BMD-equipped vessel equipped with the SM-3 Block IIA missile can defeat an ICBM-class target,"" said vice admiral and MDA director Jon Hill.
The Standard Missile 3 Block IIA (SM-3 IIA) was developed by a joint venture between Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
The ICBM was destroyed outside Earth's atmosphere, Raytheon said in a separate statement.
Hill said the test could augment the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, a network of radars, anti-ballistic missiles and other equipment designed to protect the United States from ICBMs.
""The Department is investigating the possibility of augmenting the GMD system by fielding additional sensors and weapon systems to hedge against unexpected developments in the missile threat,"" he said.

The legislation, which will be retroactive, follows an outcry after the Social Democratic government admitted it had no legal underpinning for the cull, which Denmark's mink fur farmers say will end their business for good.
""The process has been messy,"" Food and Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen said in a statement released on Monday night, about two weeks after the initial order to cull all mink was given. 
""I am very happy that with this agreement we will hopefully create some peace around the very large culling operation taking place on the country's mink farms."" 
The deal, which will be made into law in the coming month, will ban all mink breeding until 2022 and provide a legal basis for ordering farmers to cull their healthy mink herds, which contain up to 17 million animals. Culls of infected mink had already been taking place under existing law.

The government will continue negotiations with parliament in order to reach a deal on compensating some 1,100 mink farmers.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Vaccinating nine in 10 girls under 15 against cervical cancer, and improved screening and treatment of women could reduce infections by 40% and save 5 million lives by 2050, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.
Cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer among women globally, is a preventable disease but strikes at least 570,000 each year and kills 311,000, the U.N. agency said.
Almost all cases are linked to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) types transmitted by sexual contact. Infection rates are twice as high in developing countries and death rates three times higher than in high-income countries.
""If we do nothing with this disease the number of cases will increase and the number of deaths will also go up by 21% by 2030,"" Dr. Princess Nothemba Simelela from South Africa, WHO assistant director general, told a news briefing.
Health ministers from its 194 member states last week backed a strategy aimed at eliminating cervical cancer, being launched on Tuesday.
""We want countries to aim for 90% of girls under 15 vaccinated, 70% of eligible women identified and treated, 90% of women with invasive cancer treated,"" Simelela said.
Some laboratories and other tools developed during the COVID-19 pandemic will be useful for screening for cervical cancer, and new tests should speed results and treatment, she said.
""With this technology, we can get a diagnosis in 20 minutes and the woman can be treated immediately on site, making it possible to have one visit in one day and to be immediately cured of this pre-cancer lesion,"" Simelela added.
But there is often a stigma around cervical cancer, she said. 

""In the way that it shows, you start getting a smelly discharge, you start rotting from inside. It's a painful cancer to have and they don't want to speak about it.""

Thieves forced their way into Dresden's Gruenes Gewoelbe or Green Vault Museum, in November last year and got away with at least three sets of early 18th century jewellery, including diamonds and rubies.
Police were searching 18 apartments, garages and vehicles for the jewellery and other evidence including digital data, clothes and tools, mostly in the city's southern district of Neukoelln, the police force said. 
A total of 1,638 officers were taking part in the operation that could cause serious traffic disruptions through the day, it added.
Three German people were arrested on suspicion of theft and arson, and will appear before a investigating judge later in the morning, the police said. The force said the arrests took place in different parts of the country, without going into detail.
Security camera footage showed two men breaking into the museum through a grilled window in the early hours of Nov. 25. Officers were on the scene five minutes after the alarm sounded, but the thieves escaped.
The stolen jewels were worth up to 1 billion euros ($1.19 billion), Bild newspaper reported at the time, without giving a source. It said a nearby electricity junction box had been set on fire, cutting the power supply to the whole area before the heist.
The collection was brought together in the 18th century by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and later King of Poland, who commissioned ever more brilliant jewellery as part of his rivalry with France's King Louis XIV.
One of its best known treasures - the 41-carat Dresden ""Green Diamond"" - was away on loan at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art at the time of the break-in.

The treasures of the Green Vault survived Allied bombing raids in World War Two, only to be carted off as war booty by the Soviet Union. They were returned to Dresden, the historic capital of the state of Saxony, in 1958.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An Australian judge on Tuesday adjourned a trial of Australian journalists and media to consider whether to dismiss charges they breached a court suppression order on reporting of ex-Vatican treasurer George Pell's 2018 child sex abuse conviction.
Supreme Court of Victoria judge John Dixon said he expected to make the decision in a few days.
Lawyers for the media asked the court to throw out the whole case, or dismiss charges just against the journalists as they were not responsible for publishing their articles, or dismiss charges against media outside the state of Victoria - News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)'s Courier Mail and Daily Telegraph, and Nine Entertainment's Sydney Morning Herald and 2GB Radio.
Pell was convicted in December 2018 of sexually assaulting two choirboys, but reporting on the trial and outcome was gagged by the County Court of Victoria to ensure the cardinal received a fair trial on further charges he was due to face.
Overseas media, including the Washington Post, reported the news, naming Pell and the charges, shortly after the verdict.
After those were published, some Australian media ran stories saying they were unable to report major news regarding an unnamed high profile figure but flagged the news was accessible online.
The state of Victoria's prosecutors allege that publications breached the gag order by encouraging readers to find the news online, potentially tainting jurors in the second trial Pell was facing. Pell never faced a second trial.
Lawyers for the media argued on Tuesday that the prosecution's case provided no evidence that anyone who read the Australian articles went on to search for overseas articles.
""Your honour might think this journalism crossed a line, but the question is what line did it cross,"" the lawyer for Nine and Mamamia, Matt Collins, told the court.
The media's lawyers also argued that had anyone looked for those overseas articles, they would not have found the articles that the prosecution presented in its case, as those were mostly written after the Australian articles and broadcasts.
Thirteen of the 100 charges in the case were dropped last week.
Breaches of suppression orders can be punished with up to five years jail and fines of nearly A$100,000 ($73,240) for individuals and nearly A$500,000 for companies.
Pell was acquitted in April after he served more than a year in jail.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's Congress on Monday chose legislator Francisco Sagasti as the Andean country's caretaker president, in an attempt to defuse a sharp political crisis after angry protests and the departure of two presidents in the past week.
Sagasti, 76, from the centrist Morado Party, won enough votes to head Congress, which means he will constitutionally assume the presidency of Peru ahead of national elections called for April.
Sagasti will be Peru's third president in a week, after interim leader Manuel Merino resigned on Sunday, five days after being sworn in following the ousting of centrist Martin Vizcarra.
The removal of Vizcarra, who was popular with many Peruvians but angered lawmakers with his push for anti-corruption measures and attempts to curb parliamentary immunity, sparked days of protests that led to the deaths of two men.
""Today is not a day of celebration,"" Sagasti said, striking a somber tone in his first words after taking office in Congress. ""We cannot go back, bring them back to life, but we can take action from Congress, from the Executive, so that this does not happen again.""
Sagasti, a former World Bank official and engineer, faces a formidable challenge to bring stability to the world's No. 2 copper producer, which was already hard hit by COVID-19 and heading for its worst economic contraction in a century.
Shortly after the vote, Sagasti stepped outside the Congress building, raising his hand to the cheers of onlookers. Crowds in Lima's central plaza also greeted his election with jubilee.
Though the vote appeared to defuse tensions, underlying anger at police and elected lawmakers continues to simmer.
Protesters took to the streets to demonstrate peacefully in cities throughout Peru as night fell, though in smaller numbers than last week. Some rallied to congratulate Sagasti while others shouted and waved signs calling for a new constitution, or justice for those killed, injured or still missing.
Television images showed the families of the two young men killed in the rallies last week gathering for their burial.
""I ask for justice for my children,"" said Moraiba Sandoval, grandmother of one of those who died. She asked that the investigation into their deaths continue and the culprits be brought to justice.
Several human rights organizations in Peru have filed a complaint against Merino and a number of his former ministers for ""qualified homicide, serious injuries and abuse of authority,"" according to a joint statement.
Sagasti, who received 97 votes in favor with 26 against, is set to complete the current government's mandate that ends in July 2021 and will include the holding of general elections on April 11.
Peru's Congress overnight had knocked back another candidate, Rocío Silva-Santisteban, a leftist human rights defender, raising concerns over a power vacuum.
""The main thing for Peru is to regain stability and for this nightmare to end,"" legislator Alberto de Belaunde, also from the Morado Party, told reporters ahead of the Monday vote.
SETTLE THE NERVES?
The recent crisis started when Vizcarra, an independent who had long clashed with Congress over his anti-corruption stance, was impeached and removed from office by lawmakers last week over allegations of graft, which he denies. It was the second impeachment Vizcarra had faced, after surviving the first attempt in September.
Merino, who as president of the Congress led the impeachments, succeeded Vizcarra. But he resigned after the protests escalated and as lawmakers threatened to impeach him unless he stood down.
Sovereign bonds fell on Monday amid fears of a political vacuum and Peru's currency hit a record low.
Citi said in a note to investors that Sagasti's election would likely help calm the situation and support rattled markets, adding that it did not rule out the eventual return of Vizcarra. 
Shamaila Khan, director of emerging market debt at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) in New York, said it would take an ""extreme"" candidate to really hit Peruvian bonds hard.

""Political volatility has been part of the Peru landscape for some time,"" she said.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 10:30PM ET</span>","Senior Chinese official says authorities working on more Hong Kong reforms, including judiciary","HONG KONG (Reuters) - A senior Chinese official said on Tuesday that authorities are working on reforms related to semi-autonomous Hong Kong's mini-constitution, including its judicial system.
Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, told a legal summit in the global financial hub that moves to ""perfect"" the legal system in Hong Kong would not undermine judicial independence.
The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that guaranteed freedoms unavailable in mainland China and an independent judiciary.
But after prolonged anti-government and anti-China protests last year, Beijing introduced a sweeping national security law on June 30 that critics say aims to quash dissent. Supporters say it restores stability in China's most restive city.
""We need to see the Basic Law as something that is alive so we can interpret the Basic Law whenever necessary,"" said Zhang, referring to Hong Kong's mini-constitution, adding that authorities are looking to push through more ""Basic Law-related work"".
Zhang said that the work was related to ""oath optimisation"" and ""qualification screening"" for civil servants, national education, and judicial reform. He did not elaborate.
Under the new security law, civil servants are required to pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and the Basic Law.
Zhang said the moves were aimed to correct ""wrongful activities"" and cover loopholes.
""Right now is time to sort out what is true and what is false,"" Zhang said, stating that people who do not recognise the ""motherland"" or threaten the country's national security, do not fall in line with the Basic Law. 
The independence of Hong Kong's judicial system is seen as crucial for the city to thrive as a finance hub acting as an interface between mainland China's closed capital system and the rest of the world.
Zhang's comments come after Beijing passed a resolution last week to empower Hong Kong authorities to disqualify lawmakers deemed a threat to national security without having to go through courts. 
Hong Kong then immediately expelled four legislators, prompting opposition pro-democracy lawmakers to resign en masse in protest.

""Only those who are patriotic should be in place, otherwise they should be removed from the system,"" Zhang said.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Hurricane Iota began whipping a remote coastal area of Nicaragua with catastrophic winds, storm surges and rain on Monday evening, as the region's leaders blamed climate change for destruction that is pushing millions closer to hunger.
Iota was due to crash through northeastern Nicaragua's Miskito region overnight, packing maximum sustained winds of 160 miles (260 km) per hour, having reached Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. 
By 7 p.m. EST, the western edge of the storm's eye, or the ""eyewall"" had reached the country, the NHC said. Reuters images showed rain spattering the partially flooded beachside city of Puerto Cabezas on Nicaragua's coast, and wind rattling the roofs of its one-story buildings.
""We're all scared for our lives,"" said Magdalena Bell, who had taken refuge in a local shelter in Puerto Cabezas. 
Central America and southern Mexico are still reeling from Hurricane Eta, which devastated crops and washed away hillsides after landing near Puerto Cabezas two weeks ago, killing dozens. Many towns are still partially flooded, and the land is waterlogged from the earlier storm.
Along with the wind, Iota will raise sea levels as much as 20 feet (6 meters) above normal tides. It is expected to quickly weaken inland, but will dump as much as 30 inches (76 cm) of rain over the next few days. 
Earlier in the day, governments from Panama to Guatemala rushed to move people away from hillsides, volcanoes and bodies of water. The World Food Programme said millions of people already urgently needed food aid in the wake of Eta.
""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told a news conference, speaking alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei. 
Central America was among the worst affected regions in the world by climate change, the presidents said, adding tens of thousands of families had lost entire crops to Eta's destruction.
Iota will leave Honduras and its neighbors in ""a very difficult situation,"" Hernandez said. 
Since records began being kept in 1851, this is the first time two major hurricanes have formed in the Atlantic basin in November. Iota is also the first Category 5 storm of the hurricane season.
The Miskito region straddling Honduras and Nicaragua raced to get people to safety before a forecast direct hit from Iota. Its eye was about 35 miles (55 km) east-southeast of Puerto Cabezas after clipping the Colombian islands of San Andres and Providencia before dawn, cutting off electricity.
UNPRECEDENTED HURRICANE SEASON
Images from Nicaragua's military showed soldiers helping people into boats in heaving seas and trucks to move to higher land and larger towns in the watery region of jungles, rivers and coastline. 
""There are villages that can protect or save themselves, but others cannot cope with this catastrophe after Eta,"" said Teonela Wood, mayor of Honduras' Brus Laguna municipality, which she said was home to more than 17,000 people.
Many of the people of Miskito are descendants of indigenous groups along with Africans who escaped from slavery and those castaways believed to have survived a 17th-century slave shipwreck.
The unprecedented 2020 hurricane season comes as Central America is facing an economic crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic, with experts warning the compounding hardship could worsen infections, spread hunger, and fuel a new round of migration from the region.
Iota is the fiercest November storm in the region since a 1932 Cuba hurricane that packed 175-mph (281-kph) winds, according to private forecasting firm AccuWeather.
Climate change is increasing the intensity of both rain and droughts across Central America, the United Nations refugee agency said last week, saying such phenomena can exacerbate the poverty which drives people to flee their homes.

With a rise in average global temperatures, hurricanes are growing stronger and spinning more slowly, which can prolong their destructive treks across land.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the top U.S. nuclear power group said that reprocessing of nuclear waste, a technique that has been banned since the 1970s on proliferation concerns, has potential to help address a growing problem building up at nuclear plants across the country. 
""Reprocessing is a very interesting part of the solution set,"" Maria Korsnick, the head of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said during an interview last week that will be part of Reuters Events Energy Transition North America https://reutersevents.com/events/energy-transition-north-america on Friday. The technology ""would be really closing the fuel cycle in a very useful way"" because it squeezes more energy from the waste that cannot be used when it is disposed permanently. 
France and other countries reprocess nuclear waste by breaking it down into uranium and plutonium and reusing it to make new reactor fuel. 
But nonproliferation experts say militants could target the reprocessing supply chain, which would be far longer in the United States, to seize materials that could be used to make a crude nuclear weapon. 
Former President Jimmy Carter halted reprocessing in 1977, citing proliferation concerns. 
Now the United States has a growing problem with nuclear waste, currently kept at the country's nuclear reactors, first in spent fuel pools, and then in steel and concrete casks. While about $8 billion has been spent on the Yucca Mountain permanent nuclear waste repository project in Nevada, it has never opened due to local opposition. 
President Donald Trump's administration wanted to open Yucca, but Trump began opposing it in February as the presidential campaign got under way. 
Two sites in New Mexico and Texas could serve as interim nuclear waste storage sites, but local concerns are mounting that those places could become the default permanent fix. 
Rita Baranwal, the top U.S. Energy Department official on nuclear power, has said it is a shame to permanently dispose of nuclear waste and that the country should look at reprocessing and potentially export the waste to countries that could do it. 
Korsnick said the nuclear power industry is eager to work with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden on energy issues including nuclear waste. Biden's transition website lists driving down costs of advanced nuclear power and commercializing it as one way to fight climate change. 
Korsnick also applauded a decision this summer by the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), a U.S. development agency, to lift a ban on funding nuclear projects. 
She said the move would help the United States compete with Russia and China, which are also looking to export nuclear technology. The export market for U.S. advanced nuclear power technology could be worth up to $2 trillion, she said. The DFC's move was criticized by some development experts who say bringing nuclear projects to poor countries would do little to address poverty. 
On reprocessing, France has demonstrated it can be done safely, Korsnick said. ""These are all conversations that we would have to step through as we design our final solution,"" she said. ""I'm confident that we have the technological expertise to do this well.""

(Reuters) - U.S. Roman Catholic leaders called on Monday for greater transparency and vetting in the appointment of bishops after the scandal of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who rose through the ranks despite repeated allegations of sexual misconduct.
The American bishops made the suggestions during their annual general assembly, held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic and in the wake of an explosive 450-page report issued by the Vatican last week.
McCarrick, a star of the U.S. Church, was expelled from the priesthood last year after an internal investigation found him guilty of sexual abuse of minors and adults and abuse of power. 
The report showed that Pope John Paul II had promoted McCarrick in 2000 to be archbishop of Washington DC despite persistent rumours of sexual misconduct. The late pope believed his personal denial over the word of several senior Church officials who had advised him against promoting McCarrick.
""The lesson learned is that we should take very seriously the recommendations and comments that come from those in authority,"" Donald Hanchon, an auxiliary bishop of Detroit, said during a public session of the meeting that was streamed on the Internet.
Bishop Mark Brennan of Charleston, West Virginia, said procedures leading to the appointment of bishops - which are for the most part secret and carried out by Vatican representatives - should be transparent. 
""We should look at the way bishops are vetted,"" he said. Brennan added that once a priest is slated for a promotion to the bishopric, his name should be made public before he takes office.
He suggested a two-month period to give people time to come forward with any information they may have.
""I'm really amazed with the autonomy we have, that we are really beholden to no-one,"" said Bishop William Wack of Tallahassee, Florida.
""It's a stunning, stunning report... people knew, there were whispers about things but no-one put the pieces together and very few people confronted the offenders directly,"" Wack said.
Other bishops suggested the Church set up a system whereby seminarians studying for the priesthood are asked regularly if any bishop is abusing his power.
McCarrick has said he had no recollection of child abuse and has not commented publicly on allegations of misconduct with adults. Now aged 90, he is living in isolation.
The report found that he used his authority over the careers of priests and seminarians to force them to sleep with him.
The former cardinal was also a formidable fund raiser and often gave monetary gifts to other bishops and Vatican officials.
Bishop Michael Olson of Fort Worth, Texas, said the report mentioned the gifts but did not name who received the money. He said the information should be made public.
Several of the bishops defended the legacy of Pope John Paul, saying McCarrick was a pathological liar who had deceived the pontiff.

John Paul died in 2005 and was declared a saint in 2014, a record nine years for a process that sometimes takes decades or even centuries. Critics have said the canonisation process was too hasty.

""If we don't want hoards of Central Americans looking to move to other countries with better living conditions, we have to make a wall of prosperity in Central America,"" President Alejandro Giammattei said at an event in Honduras with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration. 
In 2018, the first of a series of migrant caravans set off from Central America aiming to reach the United States, despite strict migration policies under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
Along with the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis, experts have warned the aftermath of hurricane season could fuel a new round of migration from the region.
Catastrophic rainfall from Hurricane Eta earlier this month has already destroyed entire crops, and Hurricane Iota, a category 5 storm set to roar into Nicaragua overnight, is expected to bring further flooding.
""A physical wall isn't going to hold back the needs of the people,"" Giammattei added, speaking alongside Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez. 
Both said Central America has been the worst affected region in the world by climate change, itself spurred by ""industrialized"" countries. 
Giammattei also called for ending a ""vicious cycle"" of taking on debt every time natural disasters strike Central America. 

""This human development won't be achieved easily and simply through speeches, it will require actions, and actions that come from industrialized nations,"" Giammattei said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge signaled reluctance on Monday to grant Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row, extra time to petition for clemency after her attorneys fell ill with COVID-19 before they could complete her application.
In a hearing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Judge Randolph Moss questioned why lawyers for the convicted killer had not completed a draft of the clemency petition sooner, saying he believed Montgomery could still authorize other attorneys to proceed on her behalf.
The Justice Department said in October it would execute Montgomery on Dec. 8, in what would be the first federal execution of a woman since 1953.
Montgomery, now 52, was convicted in 2007 of kidnapping and strangling Bobbie Jo Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant. Montgomery then cut the baby, who survived the attack, out from the womb. 
""I would think that any vigorous and experienced counsel ... would begin on Day 1 and would have done a great deal for early November to have at least started the process of putting something together,"" Moss said.
""What I can tell you is that the amount of time was very short, given all that they had to do,"" responded Sandra Babcock, an attorney for Montgomery, telling Moss later in the hearing that clemency arguments ""can't be put together by any old person.""

Babcock said lead clemency attorneys Kelley Henry and Amy Harwell were too sick to meet the Monday night deadline to file Montgomery’s petition.
Montgomery’s lawyers say she has long suffered severe mental illness and was the victim of sexual assault, including gang rape.
Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a petition in federal court on Monday seeking a stay of the execution on the grounds that Montgomery is being held in ""torturous conditions"" likely to re-traumatize a woman who was ""sexually terrorized for decades.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia has requested a more than four-year extension under the Ottawa Treaty for removing landmines from across the country, the High Peace Commissioner's office said on Monday. 
If the request is granted, Colombia will have until the end of 2025 to remove anti-personnel landmines from its territory. The decision will be made on Nov. 20. 
The reason for the extension is to buy more time to finish active de-mining operations, High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos said in a statement. 
""This corresponds to the de-mining of more than 3 million square meters (3.6 million square yards) located in confirmed dangerous areas,"" he said.
The Ottawa Treaty, of which Colombia and more than 160 other countries are signatories, forbids the manufacture, storage and use of landmines. Extensions of removal targets must be approved by other signatories. 
The deadline for removing mines from Colombia was set to be March 1, 2021, but Colombia has asked for an extension until Dec. 31, 2025.
Colombia was once among the countries where people suffered the most injuries from landmines, a result of more than five decades of armed conflict between leftist guerrillas, crime gangs, right-wing paramilitary groups and the government.

More than 700 of Colombia's 1,122 municipalities once had landmines, but 407 of those have been declared free from mines, the High Peace Commissioner's office said.

ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia resisted international pressure for mediation in a war in the country's north on Monday as its air force bombed the Tigrayan capital Mekelle, according to diplomatic and military sources. 
Hundreds have died, 25,000 refugees have fled to Sudan and there have been reports of atrocities since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered air strikes and a ground offensive on Nov. 4 against Tigray's local rulers for defying his authority.
But Africa's youngest leader, who won a Nobel Peace Prize last year, has so far resisted pressure for talks to end a conflict that has spilled into neighbouring Eritrea and threatened to destabilise the wider Horn of Africa. 
""We are saying 'Give us time'. It's not going to take until eternity ... it will be a short-lived operation,"" Redwan Hussein, spokesman for the government's Tigray crisis task force, told reporters. 
""We have never asked Uganda or any other country to mediate,"" Redwan added, after Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni met Ethiopia's foreign minister and appealed for negotiations. 
Ethiopia's air force dropped bombs in and around Mekelle on Monday, four diplomatic and military sources told Reuters. They had no word on casualties or damage and there was no immediate information from the Ethiopian government.
Debretsion Gebremichael, leader of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), said at least two civilians had been killed and a number wounded. He said in a text message to Reuters that while Mekelle had been bombed, the town of Alamata in southern Tigray had been hit by a drone attack. 
Ethiopia's task force said earlier that federal troops had ""liberated"" Alamata from the TPLF.
The Tigray flare-up could jeopardise the recent opening up of Ethiopia's economy, stir ethnic bloodshed elsewhere around Africa's second most populous nation, and tarnish the reputation of Abiy, 44, who won his Nobel for pursuing peace with Eritrea.
The TPLF, which governs the region of 5 million people, has accused Eritrea of sending tanks and soldiers over the border against it. 
Eritrea denies that.
Tigray forces fired rockets into Eritrea at the weekend.
With communications mainly down and media barred, Reuters could not independently verify assertions made by all sides.
'INFLICTING SUFFERING'
There was no immediate comment from Tigray's leaders about Alamata, about 120 km (75 miles) from Mekelle.
Debretsion urged the United Nations and African Union to condemn Ethiopia's federal troops, accusing them of using high-tech weaponry including drones in attacks he said destroyed a dam and a sugar factory. 
""Abiy Ahmed is waging this war on the people of Tigray and is responsible for the purposeful infliction of human suffering,"" he said.
The government has denied targeting the dam or civilian locations, but has not commented on the sugar factory.
Tigray leaders accuse Abiy, from the largest Oromo ethnic group, of persecuting them and purging them from government and security forces over the last two years. He says they rose up against him by attacking a military base. 
Amnesty International has denounced the killing of scores and possibly hundreds of civilian labourers in a massacre that both sides have blamed on each other.
Museveni tweeted that he met Demeke Mekonnen, Ethiopia's foreign minister and deputy prime minister, in Uganda.
""There should be negotiations and the conflict stopped, lest it leads to unnecessary loss of lives and cripples the economy,"" he said in a tweet later deleted. 
REGIONAL EXHORTATIONS
Demeke went on to Kenya afterwards.
""Everybody is encouraging talks, it's very urgent,"" said Mahboub Maalim, a Kenyan diplomat who heads the Nairobi-based regional think-tank Sahan. ""We should focus on a ceasefire."" 
Kenya and Djibouti urged a peaceful resolution and the opening of humanitarian corridors, while Nigeria's former president Olusegun Obasanjo went to Ethiopia.
European nations were also weighing in, diplomats said, with Norway planning to send a special envoy.
One diplomat said Ethiopia's army was reporting it had retaken 60% of Tigray and was planning a multi-pronged offensive on Mekelle, aiming to reach it in three days. 
The Ethiopian National Defence Force has around 140,000 personnel and plenty of experience from fighting Somali militants, rebels in border regions, and Eritrea.
But many senior officers were Tigrayan, much of its most powerful weaponry is there and the TPLF has seized the powerful Northern Command's headquarters in Mekelle. 

The TPLF itself has a formidable history, spearheading the rebel march to Addis Ababa that ousted a Marxist dictatorship in 1991 and bearing the brunt of the 1998-2000 war with Eritrea that killed hundreds of thousands.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 04:01PM ET</span>","Trump poised to settle for partial Afghan withdrawal, despite Pentagon shakeup: sources","By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's new Pentagon team has not yet signalled an imminent withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, raising expectations among U.S. officials and allies that Trump might settle for a partial reduction before leaving office.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the military was expecting formal orders in the coming days to go down to about 2,500 troops in Afghanistan by early next year from around 4,500 currently.
A NATO official also cited expectations of a 1,500 to 2,000 troop decline.
Trump fired his defense secretary, Mark Esper, and appointed other top Pentagon officials last week after longstanding concerns that his priorities were not being dealt with urgently enough at the Defense Department.
They included ending the 19-year-old Afghan engagement by Christmas, an ambitious target that opponents of the country's longest war welcomed but which Trump's critics warned could be reckless given ongoing militant violence plaguing Afghanistan.
Afghanistan has featured in a flurry of introductory calls by acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, Esper's replacement, to U.S. allies' defense ministers and chiefs of defense, a senior U.S. defense official told Reuters.
""It was a part of many of them because it is of great importance to our NATO allies, our allies in the region and also just global security and protecting the American homeland,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
But the official, speaking after the calls with allies, suggested that Trump would not push a withdrawal faster than conditions on the ground allow.
U.S. and Afghan officials are warning of troubling levels of violence by Taliban insurgents and persistent Taliban links to al Qaeda.
It was those ties that triggered U.S. military intervention in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks, which al Qaeda carried out. Thousands of American and allied troops have died in fighting in Afghanistan since then.
Some U.S. military officials, citing U.S. counter-terrorism priorities in Afghanistan, have privately urged Trump against going to zero at this point and want to keep U.S. troop levels at around 4,500 for now.
""The president has acted appropriately in this, has never said: 'Hey, we're going to zero. Let's go tomorrow.' It has always been a conditions-based effort and that effort continues,"" the senior U.S. defense official said, without explicitly detailing future drawdown plans.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
'SEE FIGHT TO THE FINISH'
Over the past four years, predicting Trump's policy pronouncements has not always been easy.
On Oct. 7, Trump said on Twitter https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313984510749544450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1313984510749544450%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F10%2F08%2Ftrump-says-us-troops-in-afghanistan-should-be-home-by-christmas.html: ""We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas!""
But U.S. officials say he has yet to issue orders to carry that withdrawal out. On Monday the first U.S. official said the Pentagon had told commanders to start planning for the more moderate reduction to 2,500 troops.
A total withdrawal now would be difficult for the U.S. military to execute, especially given the reliance of NATO allies on the United States for logistical support, they add.
The NATO official, who asked not to be named, said the belief was the United States could soon announce a drawdown to 2,500 to 3,000 troops by Christmas.
National security adviser Robert O'Brien already raised such a possibility, saying last month the United States would go down to 2,500 by early 2021, in comments overshadowed by Trump's Christmas timeline.
A NATO diplomat said Miller, in his introductory call with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, did not suggest a complete withdrawal but instead a reduction of troops.
The senior U.S. defense official said U.S. withdrawals from Afghanistan had been carried out in an ""educated way so as not to revisit the Iraq withdrawal that failed in 2011.""
Then-President Barack Obama withdrew troops against military advice, only to return them to Iraq three years later.
Regardless of what Trump might do, Taliban militants, fighting against the U.S.-backed government in Kabul, have called on the United States to stick to a February agreement with the Trump administration to withdraw U.S. troops by May, subject to certain security guarantees.
Violence has been rising throughout Afghanistan, with the Taliban attacking provincial capitals, in some case prompting U.S. airstrikes.
In Kabul, there is growing fear of a precipitous withdrawal that could further embolden the Taliban and undercut already sputtering peace talks, sources say.Miller, in a message to the U.S. armed forces chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/https://media.defense.gov/2020/Nov/14/2002535407/-1/-1/0/INITIAL-MESSAGE-TO-THE-DEPARTMENT.PDF?source=GovDelivery released over the weekend, echoed Trump's desire to end America's overseas engagements by saying ""it's time to come home."" But he did not offer a timetable and stressed the need to finish the fight against al Qaeda.
The Taliban harbored al Qaeda's leaders and the U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan said the Taliban had not fulfilled their February accord commitment to break ties with al Qaeda.

""We are on the verge of defeating al Qaeda and its associates, but we must avoid our past strategic error of failing to see the fight through to the finish,"" wrote Miller, a former Green Beret and counter-terrorism official.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Several cities in Poland illuminated buildings with rainbow colours on Monday in a gesture of solidarity with the LGBT+ community, but activists called for more support in the face of rising hostility.
LGBT rights have been a flashpoint in Poland over the last two years, with politicians tied to the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party and senior members of the Catholic Church arguing against what they term ""LGBT ideology"".
Last week liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, along with several other city mayors, pledged to illuminate buildings with rainbow colours to mark the International Day for Tolerance. 
To many religious conservatives in predominantly Catholic Poland, Trzaskowski represented a threat to traditional values when he signed an ""LGBT+ Charter"" pledging, for example, to introduce education about LGBT rights in Warsaw schools.
But LGBT+ activists say Trzaskowski has not fulfilled the promises he made, which included creating a shelter for young LGBT+ people who became homeless after coming out to their families.
""This is obviously a symbolic gesture and we welcome it when it comes from mayors of smaller cities and smaller towns,"" said Hubert Sobecki, an activist with a non-governmental organisation Love does not exclude.
""We expect more from someone who ... pledged to do something tangible for the community,"" he said, adding that two years after the ""LGBT+ Charter"" was signed ""there was absolutely no action from the municipality"".
A Warsaw city hall spokeswoman said the mayor was committed to the charter's proposals but their implementation was ""a complex process"" and some efforts had been halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Buildings were also illuminated in Gdansk, Krakow, Poznan, Wroclaw and other smaller towns.
Activists say hostility is rising against LGBT+ people in Poland, which does not recognise any form of same-sex marriage, and there have even been calls for Pride parades to be banned. 
Bartosz Staszewski, a filmmaker and LGBT activist, said the illumination of a bridge over the Vistula river in Warsaw made him think of a trans activist who died after jumping off a bridge.
""I have such terribly bad associations when now the same bridges are simply rainbow-lit and nothing more will happen in Warsaw,"" he said.

At least two convoys of buses carrying residents arrived in Stepanakert, the capital of the mountainous area, from neighbouring Armenia over the weekend. 
Under the terms of the agreement, control over the enclave's main city Stepanakert, in territory internationally recognised as Azerbaijan, will stay with ethnic Armenians despite them being forced to cede other land to a victorious Azerbaijan.
On Monday, refugees lined up in the centre of Stepanakert, which had been deserted for weeks beforehand, to collect bags of humanitarian aid which included staples such as canned food and pasta.
Several men handed out rolled-up pieces of plastic which the returnees could use to fix broken windows in their homes
Some said they had come back with a heavy heart.
“I have seen the third war already here. In 1992 and 2016 I did not leave the city for even a minute. But this time it was awful,” said a middle-aged woman who declined to give her name.
The woman, who said she had returned on Sunday, said she had left for the Armenian border town of Sisian after the first week of fighting in early October when she had been forced to hide from shelling in a bomb shelter.
While Stepanakert may remain in ethnic Armenian hands after the deal, Shusha, the second largest town in Nagorno-Karabakh, is now controlled by Azerbaijan after fierce fighting. 
“There are no Armenians in Shusha now,” said 35-year-old Alexander Simonyan, a gymnastics teacher from Shusha.
When the fighting began, he sent his wife and children to Armenia and joined the Nagorno-Karabakh defence forces. 
He said he now lived with a friend in Stepanakert and had nowhere to house his family, though he hoped local authorities might offer them all somewhere to live. “This is our land. Where else can I go? I can’t live in another place.”
The Russian defence ministry said on Monday it had helped 475 people to return on Sunday and that a total of 725 people had come back to the enclave since Nov. 14. 
LOST LAND
After the ceasefire, Andranik Sarkisyan, 27, a former fighter, managed to bring his wife and two sons back from Armenia to their home village of Badara in Nagorno-Karabakh.
News of the truce had been painful, he said. “I was on the front line and they (commanders) simply called and told us that the land has been given up. All the soldiers were crying.”
Sarkisyan worked as a hairdresser in Stepanakert before the war and went to fight in the district of Gadrut, which was taken by Azeri forces at the start of the conflict.
Many men in his battalion had been killed by artillery fire in an Oct. 11 attack, he said, adding that he had only survived because he had left earlier to guard a checkpoint.
“The guys were simply burnt, they died, we collected their body parts. I saw it every night. It was unbearable, impossible,” he said.
Such memories make it difficult for him to think about the terms of the settlement.

“It is not about land. It is about the blood spilled on it,” he said. “I hope it was the last war.”

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former Harvard University fencing coach and the chief executive of a telecommunications company were arrested on Monday on charges that they engaged in a bribery scheme aimed at securing the admission of the businessman's two sons to the Ivy League school.
Federal prosecutors in Boston said that Jie ""Jack"" Zhao paid more than $1.5 million in bribes so that Peter Brand, the former coach, would help his sons get into Harvard by recruiting them to the men's fencing team.
The charges followed an investigative report by the Boston Globe last year into how Brand sold his home to Zhao for over its assessed market value. Harvard in July 2019 fired the longtime coach following the report.
The Globe's report came a month after federal prosecutors in March 2019 unveiled the first charges in the U.S. college admissions scandal, in which wealthy parents engaged in bribery and cheating schemes to secure spots for their children at selective universities.
That investigation has led to charges against 57 people, including celebrities and corporate executives. U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling called the latest case ""part of our long-standing effort to expose and deter corruption in college admissions.""
Lawyers for Brand and Zhao, who co-founded iTalk Global Communications Inc, did not respond to requests for comment.
Prosecutors said that in 2013, Zhao made a $1 million donation to a fencing charity operated by an unnamed co-conspirator that, in turn, contributed $100,000 to a foundation established by Brand and his wife.
Zhao also paid for Brand's car, made college tuition payments for his son, paid the mortgage on his home and later bought the residence from the coach for above its market value, prosecutors said.

That purchase allowed Brand to buy a more expensive home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which Zhao paid to renovate, they said.

Three Arab countries - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan - set aside hostilities with Israel in recent months to agree to formal relations in deals brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
Palestinian leaders have accused them of betrayal, while U.S. and Israeli officials have said more Arab states could soon follow.
""I think it's better to have a united (Arab) front to put the interests of the Palestinians (first) to end the (Israeli) occupation,"" Qatar Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told the online Global Security Forum.
He said division was not in the interest of concerted Arab efforts to get the Israelis to negotiate with the Palestinians and resolve the decades-long conflict between the sides. 
However, for the states who established ties, ""it is up to them at the end of the day to decide what is best for their countries"", he said. 
The UAE, Bahrain and Sudan broke with decades of Arab policy that had demanded Israel first cede land to the Palestinians to form their own state before establishing relations.
UAE officials have said the Gulf state remains committed to Palestinian statehood, and that its deal with Israel had stopped further annexation of lands Palestinians seek for a state.
Until this year, Israel had only current formal relations with just two Arab states - its neighbours Egypt and Jordan - established under peace deals reached decades ago.
Qatar has been tipped by Israeli officials as among Arab and other Muslim-majority countries that could establish formal ties with Israel. 
Sheikh Mohammed said Doha maintains some relations with Israel, though only on matters concerning the Palestinians such as humanitarian needs or development projects.

Qatar, which also has relations with two of Israel's bitter enemies, Iran and Palestinian militant group Hamas, supports a two-state solution with East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state, a stance the foreign minister reiterated.

The GBA said the man, identified only as Amin K. under German privacy laws, had been working at the press office since 1999 and was hired by the Egyptian embassy in Berlin in 2010 ""at the latest"".
The Egyptian embassy in Berlin was not immediately available for comment.
Prosecutors allege the man was instructed to assist Egypt's General Intelligence Service (GIS) with assessing how Egypt was portrayed in German media, according to a statement from the Federal Public Prosecutor General.
He had also tried to assist GIS efforts to hire another agent in Germany but those efforts were unsuccessful, the statement said, giving no further details.
In exchange for his work the suspect was promised preferential treatment for himself and his family by Egyptian authorities, according to German prosecutors.
The case was mentioned in the BfV domestic intelligence agency's 385-page annual report, published in July. The report said unspecified measures had been taken against the man in December.

RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of a hardline Islamist party clashed with police on the main road into Pakistan's capital city on Monday following protests over the recent use of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in France, and several people were injured.
The protesters from the Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) party that has made blasphemy its rallying cry are demanding that the government severs diplomatic ties with France and expels its ambassador, police and party officials said.
The government has yet to respond to their demands.
Police blocked the demonstrators as they attempted to enter Islamabad. Some chanted that the only punishment for a blasphemer was beheading, police official Tauqeer Shah said.
The protesters attacked the police with bricks, stones and sticks, he added. 
""Several of our officers were injured,"" he said, adding that nearly 2,000 protesters had camped at the main entrance to the city, refusing to leave. 
""We want the government to expel the French ambassador immediately,"" the TLP's vice president Zaheer-ul-Hasan said in a video statement. He added that scores of protesters were injured in the clashes.
Protests broke out in several Muslim countries over France's response to a deadly attack last month on a teacher who showed cartoons mocking the Prophet Mohammad to pupils during a civics lesson. For Muslims, depictions of the Prophet are blasphemous.
In the knife attack, an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin beheaded the teacher, Samuel Paty.
French officials said the beheading was an assault on the core French value of freedom of expression.
After satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo re-published the cartoons in September, French President Emmanuel Macron said the freedom to blaspheme went hand in hand with the freedom of belief in France.
In Pakistan and other Muslim-majority countries, people accused France's government of being Islamophobic and needlessly provoking believers. Pakistan has condemned the re-printing of the cartoons.
There is a history of violent reaction to alleged incidents of blasphemy in Pakistan, where insulting the Prophet Mohammad carries a mandatory death penalty.
Members of the TLP party also camped for several days at the same entrance to Islamabad in 2017 to demand that a small change in local law be deemed blasphemous. In ensuing clashes, at least six protesters and one member of the police were killed and more than 150 injured.
Islamabad's administration on Monday blocked most of the main roads into the city as well as mobile phone signals to prevent protesters from regrouping, a move that paralysed the capital.
""We're trying our best to clear the route,"" the capital's deputy commissioner Hamza Shafaat tweeted.

Later in the day, paramilitary forces tried to disperse the protesters, but were forced to back away.

The Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) - the most comprehensive survey of its kind on the continent - rates 54 African nations against criteria including security, human rights, economic stability, just laws, free elections, corruption, infrastructure, poverty, health and education.
The 2019 African average score for overall governance declined by -0.2 points from 2018, registering the first year-on-year score deterioration since 2010, the report published by the foundation of Sudanese telecoms tycoon Mo Ibrahim said. 
The Mo Ibrahim Foundation compiles the data in the aim of promoting better governance and economic development in Africa.
The report said that progress achieved over the past decade was mainly driven by improvements in economic opportunities and human development. 
""This is threatened, however, by an increasingly precarious security situation and concerning erosion in rights as well as civic and democratic space,"" it said.
The survey registered what it considered worrying declines in the areas of participation, rights and inclusion, and security and rule of law. 
Top performers according to country rankings included Mauritius, Cape Verde and Seychelles, with South Sudan, Eritrea and finally Equatorial Guinea rounding out the bottom of the classification.
Though the report provides a comprehensive picture of the period up to just before Africa was hit by COVID-19, its authors said it can also help analyse which pre-existing weaknesses may have been exacerbated by the pandemic.
While Africa has been spared infections on a scale seen in many other regions, the virus has nonetheless highlighted gaps in African healthcare systems, it said, as well as triggering a major economic crisis.

""Furthermore, it has contributed to a declining democratic environment, increasing food insecurity, as well as instability and violence, including gender-based,"" it said.

ROME (Reuters) - Sirio Persichetti can't speak and can't feed himself but the seven-year-old has taken the social media world by storm with his daily antics, proving that a disability is no barrier to inspiring others.
Sirio has spastic tetraplegia, a form of cerebral palsy that affects the movement of three limbs.
His mouth is permanently open, blocking him from forming words properly or swallowing. He is fed liquid nutrition through a tube in his stomach and has had a tracheotomy to help him breathe.
He bears this with such resilience, vivacity and lust for life that it prompted his mother Valentina to create a website and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram and Twitter accounts to chronicle his everyday life in hopes of inspiring others. 
She uploads heart-warming videos of him with funny anecdotes under the title ""Sirio and the tetrabonds"", that have touched the hearts of people all over the world. Tetra comes from the first half of tetraplegia and bond from vagabond.
""We wanted to tell the story of disability in a different way, to tell it for what it is, something that is not easy to face, but that if channelled in the right direction, with the right help, it can allow these children to enjoy something that can actually be called life,"" Valentina said.
The response has been overwhelming, with some videos getting more than 130,000 views. 
""In a short time the response, especially from families living in similar situations, was powerful and exciting so we decided to keep going,"" Valentina said.
BREAKING THE STIGMA
She posts videos of Sirio going to school carrying a backpack almost as big as he is, or driving a toy electric car or mercilessly waking up his older brother Nilo, 10.
Sirio's followers respond with dozens of likes and messages of support. 
Valentina said she wanted to break the stigma that often surrounds disability by showing that having special needs does not mean an end to fun for a child.
""We understood that it is absolutely necessary to talk about disability without (seeking) pity, different from the usual way disability is narrated,"" she said.
Imagining the world as seen through his eyes, Valentina writes the posts that accompany the videos.
""Here I am arriving at the playground, fearless and proud while mamma watches me like a hawk. It's not easy trying to live a normal life when you have disabilities but I try anyway,"" reads one post.
Valentina, 38, who works in a call centre for the postal service, is helped by her husband Paolo, a 58-year-old researcher, and two caregivers who work alternate days. 

She said she never expected it to go viral ""but we realised that is useful, that it helps and is a necessary step to make the life of many people much more normal"".

BEIRUT (Reuters) - She stands nearly three metres tall with her arm raised, the wind whipping the hair away from her scarred face, and a broken clock at her feet with the hands showing 6.08, the time that a blast ripped through Beirut port on the evening of Aug. 4.
The unnamed statue by Lebanese artist Hayat Nazer is made of broken glass and twisted materials that belonged to people's homes before the explosion that killed 200 and injured 6,000, and symbolises the city's hopes of rising from the rubble.
""If you look at the statue, one half has a leg standing, the hand looks surrendered, there is a scar on the face with the flying hair and the clock on this side, as if the explosion is still happening,"" Nazer told Reuters Television.
""But the other hand and the other leg...is leaning as if it is starting to walk and the hand is raised, it wants to continue, it wants to keep going and rise from the rubble. And this is the truth, this is our truth,"" the 33-year-old said.
The huge blast, which levelled a swathe of Beirut and made some 300,000 residents homeless, has compounded Lebanon's worst financial crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
Nazer believes in Lebanese resilience.
She says those affected by the blast who saw the 2.6-metre statue, temporarily displayed in front of the damaged port, drew strength and hope to carry on.
Nazer had already started on a female sculpture before the blast, but volunteered to help clean up destroyed houses and streets. At night, she would return to the sculpture, using the shards of glass and metal pieces she had collected.
""I felt like Beirut was a woman...who despite what she suffered...is very strong,"" she said. 
Inspired by Lebanese singer Majida El Roumi's ""Beirut, Lady of the World"" and its lyrics ""Rise from under the rubble"", Nazer says the statue took her a little more than two months to complete.
She did not name the artwork because she wanted the public to do so.
This is not the first time Nazer has used debris in her art.
Her previous works include a model of the mythological Phoenix made out of pieces of protesters' burnt tents, and a heart-shaped sculpture from stones and empty teargas canisters collected from clashes between protesters and security forces.

YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan resigned from his post on Monday in a sign of political fall-out in the ex-Soviet republic after a ceasefire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict that locked in territorial gains for Azerbaijan. 
Mnatsakanyan, whose departure was announced by the ministry's spokeswoman on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, had held the position since May 2018. 
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's government has faced a popular backlash over the ceasefire accord that ended six weeks of fighting, with thousands of protesters last week demanding he resign.
On Monday, hundreds of protesters rallied in the capital Yerevan's central Freedom Square.
The ceasefire signed by leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia on Nov. 10 halted military action in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians. Some 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are now being deployed to the region.
Mnatsakanyan met Azeri counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov three times in the past month and a half in search of a ceasefire arrangement, but each effort quickly broke down.
For over 25 years until fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh resumed on Sept. 27, ethnic Armenians held military control over the entire mountainous pocket and substantial swathes of Azeri territory ringing it. But when the guns fell silent, they had lost much of the enclave itself - including its second city Shushi, which Azeris call Shusha - as well as adjoining terrain. 
Pashinyan said on Monday the war could have been avoided if Armenia had voluntarily ceded control of seven regions surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh as well as Shushi. ""But we took up the challenge of war,"" he told a news conference.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anna Naghdalyan wrote on Facebook shortly afterwards that giving up Shushi was never on the agenda at any stage of negotiations between the sides.
Pashinyan said the road through the Lachin region that connects Nagorno Karabakh with Armenian state territory would be reopened later on Monday, and that many displaced residents of the enclave were returning to their homes.
Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Monday to discuss the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Kremlin said.

The two leaders said the situation in the South Caucasus region had generally stabilised and that it was time to address humanitarian issues, including the return of refugees and the preservation of Christian churches and monasteries.

Cardinal Henryk Gulbinowicz, the former archbishop of Wroclaw, had been disciplined after an investigation into ""allegations regarding the cardinal's past"", the Vatican's nunciature (embassy) in Poland said earlier this month.
The Church said on Twitter that he had died on Monday morning. Polish media said Gulbinowicz had been in hospital in a serious condition for more than a week.
""I am asking God in His mercy to forgive the deceased for what caused suffering to the victims and pain to the community of believers,"" Archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki, Poland's most senior cleric, wrote in a message of condolence.
Last year, Poland's Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper published an article written by a man who accused Gulbinowicz of sexually abusing him when he was a minor in the 1990s and a student in a Catholic seminary.
The case was brought to prosecutors but they could not proceed because of the statue of limitations. At the time, the cardinal's lawyer said the accusations were false.
However, Gulbinowicz was barred from practising his ministry in public and ordered to contribute to a fund to help victims of sexual abuse, the nunciature said.
It also said he would be denied burial in what was once his cathedral, a tradition in Roman Catholic countries.
Gulbinowicz was the latest of several clerics to be caught up in sexual abuse scandals in Poland, the homeland of the late Pope John Paul II, where the Catholic Church remains very influential.

The Vatican recently ordered an investigation into the former archbishop of Gdansk on suspicion of negligence over sex abuse allegations, a month after Pope Francis accepted the resignation of a Polish bishop accused of shielding sexually abusive priests.

729,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>","Syria's top diplomat Moalem, soft-spoken defender of Assad, dies at 79","By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - ‮Syria's‬ long-time foreign minister Walid al-Moalem, an unyielding defender of Syrian President Bashar al Assad's bloody crackdown on peaceful protesters that sparked a decade old conflict, died on Monday, the government said.
There were no details on the cause of death, but the 79-year old had been in poor health with heart problems. A source close to the government said it was expected his deputy, veteran diplomat Faisal Mekdad, would replace him as foreign minister.
The genial public face of Assad's rule to the outside world, Moalem was branded a traitor by the opposition for supporting the violent crackdown on protesters at the beginning of the conflict in 2011. Thousands took to the streets that year demanding an end to the Assad family's decades-old authoritarian rule that later erupted into a full-scale civil war.
Moalem was unrepentant. The soft-spoken diplomat accused the United States and others in the West of fuelling his country's unrest and labelled insurgents ""jihadi terrorists"" in a conflict in which more than half a million people have been killed and more than 5.6 million have become refugees, most of them Sunnis.
""No government in the world can accept an armed terrorist group, some of them coming from abroad, controlling streets and villages in the name of 'jihad',"" Moalem said in a 2012 newspaper interview.
He was first appointed foreign minister in 2006 and was also a deputy prime minister. He held a series of top diplomatic posts, including envoy to the United States and was involved in unsuccessful negotiations with Israel in the 1990s on a peace settlement.
""He was known for his honourable patriotic positions,"" the government said in a statement, adding he died at dawn and would be buried later on Monday in Damascus.
The veteran diplomat saw his country tilt further towards Iran and Russia, which have helped shore up Assad's rule and allowed the authoritarian leader to regain most of the territory he once lost to insurgents.
""This is very sad news. I have lost a very close friend in the Arab world. He was a reliable partner, a very knowledgeable person, diplomat and politician,"" Russia's TASS news agency quoted Mikhail Bogdanov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister.
Born in 1941 to a Sunni family from Damascus, Moalem publicly defended Moscow and Shi'ite Iran's growing military role, backed by its proxies in Syria, which many Syrian opponents of Assad labelled an occupation and blamed for fuelling sectarian tension in a Sunni-majority country.
""I am ready to be one of Hassan Nasrallahʹs soldiers,"" Moalem said in August 2006, referring to the leader of the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah, which has in recent years sent thousands of its members to fight alongside Assad's forces.
Assad is drawn from the minority Alawite sect whose members control the security forces and army that led the crackdown. Human rights groups and the United Nations said the crackdown caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians.
Moalem recently attacked the Caesar Act - the toughest U.S. sanctions yet against Damascus - which came into force last June, saying they were meant to starve Syrians. He vowed that his country would get economic help from Iran and Russia to soften its blow. 

Washington says the goal of the new sanctions is to hold Damascus to account for war crimes and deter it from further pursuing the war. The sanctions exempt humanitarian aid.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - The European Union will not deploy an observer mission for Uganda's presidential election in January, an official said on Monday, after complaints that advice from previous observers to make the polls fair went unheeded.
In the Jan. 14 vote, President Yoweri Museveni, 76, will face off against youthful pop star and lawmaker Robert Kyagulanyi, widely known by his music moniker Bobi Wine and who is seen as the incumbent president's closest competitor.
In the same election, voters will also pick their lawmakers. 
""An EOM (election observer mission) will not be present in Uganda in 2021,"" Attilio Pacific, EU ambassador and head of delegation to Uganda, told Reuters in an email. 
He said in taking a decision not to send observers, the EU had considered whether Uganda had ""made progress on recommendations provided by previous EU electoral missions.""
The EU typically sends the largest team of any similar blocs - a total of 94 monitors were sent at the last poll - and they have stayed in the country sometimes for up to three months. 
According to an EU 2018 report, none of the 30 recommendations made by the observer mission sent to monitor the last election in 2016 was implemented.
The recommendations included reforms to make the poll body more independent, elimination of excessive use of force by the armed forces and more transparency in tallying.
Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo and Museveni's spokesman, Don Wanyama, were not immediately available for comment.
""What the EU observers do is to add an international flavour of scrutiny, that element now will not be there in 2021,"" said Chrispin Kaheru, a Kampala-based political analyst.
Wine has complained of harassment and intimidation by security forces.

On the day he was nominated, he was briefly detained after police and military personnel broke his car windows and forcefully removed him.

The scientists said that the government's plans signalled a change in strategy from the ""test and trace"" scheme that has been plagued by difficulties, but that screening the general population regularly would throw up new problems.
""The evidence for screening is not there. The evidence around the tests is poor and weak at the moment, and needs to be improved,"" Professor Allyson Pollock, Clinical Professor of Public Health, University of Newcastle, told reporters 
""We're arguing the moonshot programme really should be paused, until the cost effectiveness and the value for money of any of these programmes is well established."" 
Pollock, along with colleagues from universities in Birmingham, Warwick and Bristol, warned that ineffective testing strategies and inaccurate tests could endanger confidence in testing more generally.
The scientists said that the priority should be improving the test and trace system, adding that a lack of accuracy in the rapid tests could give false reassurance to people that they weren't infectious.
The government last week published results of an evaluation of an Innova rapid test, which it said detected around 75% of positive cases, rising to 95% of individuals with high viral loads.
Jon Deeks, Professor of Biostatistics at University of Birmingham, said that analysis of the results showed that it might miss between 25-50% of positive cases, giving false reassurance to people who test negative.
He also said that the higher proportion of people testing positive with larger viral loads did not mean that the most infectious people could be reliably identified by the test.
""The arguments that we're hearing, and these have been said by the Prime Minister, that this test can tell the difference between infectious and non-infectious is not substantiated by any data,"" Deeks said. ""There is no data out there to show this.""

LISBON (Reuters) - Helplines across Europe have reported higher demand for their services as the coronavirus pandemic adds to the hurdles many women face to access abortion.
While abortion is legal in most of Europe, some women have struggled to get appointments in public health systems overwhelmed by the pandemic. Others could not escape abusive partners because of lockdowns, non-governmental organisations and some women who chose to have an abortion told Reuters.
In countries where abortion is highly restricted, such as Poland, women found themselves unable to travel abroad to terminate an unwanted pregnancy as the pandemic grounded flights and closed borders. 
""In some cases it made abortion catastrophically more complicated,"" said Mara Clarke, head of the UK-based Abortion Support Network (ASN), which helps women get abortions abroad.
Sending abortion pills by post, a common practice for organisations helping women in places where it is not widely available, became difficult because packages were taking weeks to be delivered.
When she found out she was pregnant in April, mother-of-two Ania, from Warsaw in Poland, said she had experienced two miscarriages and decided it was not the right time to have another baby.
""It was intense ... really hard,"" she said. ""If it wasn't for the pandemic I would have gone to another country - to Slovakia or the Czech Republic.""
Ania, who declined to give her surname for fear of stigma, eventually managed to terminate her pregnancy with help from Women on Web, an NGO which supports women in her situation.
She is one of thousands of people now protesting in Poland against a court ruling last month that could amount to a near-total ban on abortion in the staunchly Roman Catholic country.
""DANGEROUS""
Abortion Without Borders, a helpline in Poland that launched in December 2019, has received nearly 2,300 calls this year, with a jump in requests for help since a lockdown was announced. 
Women in the island-nation of Malta, the only country in Europe where abortion is banned, and where the airport was shut for months due to COVID-19, were the worst hit, Clarke said.
Calls from Malta to an ASN helpline almost doubled, from 44 in 2019 to 83 this year. 
In Romania, where abortion is legal within a 14-week limit, some women struggled to access services as the government deemed it a ""non-essential procedure"" as its healthcare system battled the coronavirus, women's rights groups said. 
Romania-based FILIA said in April only 11% of 112 state hospitals surveyed were providing abortions, and none in the capital Bucharest. 
Experts fear restrictions to tackle a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe will create further challenges, especially in countries where healthcare systems are under-resourced.
Marie Stopes International, a non-profit organisation providing contraception and abortion services, has estimated an additional 2.7 million unsafe abortions will take place worldwide as a result of health service disruptions.
""The pandemic had an impact on reproductive health as a whole - because it was not considered a priority,"" said one of Portugal's top obstetricians Teresa Bombas.
Rebecca Gomperts, founder of Women on Web, said remote working and lockdowns also created problems for some women with controlling partners as they were unable to leave home.
Requests to Women on Web have been higher this year than the group expected based on previous years, particularly in Portugal - where the procedure is provided mostly in a hospital setting - with 34 demands, and in Northern Ireland - where abortion was decriminalised in 2019 - with 97.
Some governments have taken steps to tackle the issue. In Britain, where abortion is legal in England, Scotland and Wales within a 24-week limit, women can now take abortion pills at home instead of going to hospital and some consultations have moved online.
""We have seen such colossal advantages,"" said Jonathan Lord, Marie Stopes UK's medical director, who hopes the measure will become permanent. 
But rights groups say many more will face a struggle in the coming months because of the economic damage caused by the pandemic.

""Half of all pregnancies are unplanned and people will look at the economic forecast right now and decide not to do it,"" Clarke said. ""We are in for a very hard 2021.""

In an affidavit filed last week and made public on Monday, Zuma said: ""There is a general acceptance of testimony of witnesses willing to implicate me"". He also said he had a personal relationship with Zondo, which he did not explain further.

Responding to the affidavit during Monday's hearing, Judge Zondo did not directly address the accusation that he was biased, and said any suggestion he had a personal friendship with Zuma was ""inaccurate"".

MADRID (Reuters) - Thirty-one-year-old Ines Alcolea ditched the bustling life of Madrid in October for a village near the much quieter medieval town of Toledo, unable to face the prospect of more COVID-19 restrictions in her small flat in the Spanish capital.
""At least here, if there's another lockdown we'll have more space, a garden. It'll be lighter,"" Alcolea said, sitting in her new home surrounded by boxes and her two cats.
She is paying half the rent she used to for nearly twice the space, and has a rooftop terrace thrown in.
The COVID-19 crisis was the tipping point for the video game communications expert and other Spanish millennials already struggling to find good accommodation in a tight real estate market in the capital and other major cities.
""We realised our quality of life would never improve as long as we lived in Madrid ... and our landlord wouldn't lower the rent despite the crisis,"" said Alcolea, who had been living in the working-class area of Vallecas, targeted by tougher restrictions than the rest of the region.
Squeezed by years of rising rent and high youth unemployment that got worse with the pandemic, young Spaniards are especially vulnerable to the current economic crisis. On average, they buy their first house ten years later than other Europeans.
""Young people are the most hurt by this crisis,"" said a spokeswoman for online property portal Fotocasa.
She added that many young people at first disappeared from the real estate market with the pandemic, before coming back to look more actively than other age groups for a change of scene.
That shows with rooms in flatshares - usually occupied by students and young professionals - whose availability spiked 203% in Madrid between March and October and doubled in Barcelona over the same period, data from property portal Idealista show.
One of those making that change was 25-year-old dental hygienist Jennifer Delgado.
After years of living in flatshares in Madrid, Delgado and her girlfriend moved back to her home region of the Canary Islands a few months into the pandemic.
CONFINEMENT
They now rent a flat in central Tenerife, boasting a guest bedroom and office, for 600 euros a month - less than a third of what it would cost in the capital.
""I was tired of working 24/7, tired of Madrid, where the quality of life is so low because you essentially live to pay (bills),"" said Delgado, for whom another confinement without seeing her family was out of the question.
COVID-19 also prompted 33-year-old communications specialist Jara Exposito to re-evaluate the small first-floor one-bedroom property she and her husband bought three years ago.
The couple are selling, hoping to buy a plot of land and build a house in the countryside north of Madrid.
""The confinement triggered that final click in our minds ... made everybody reconsider what mattered to them - and for me, a house was one of them,"" Exposito said.
Some are in a rush.
Alejandro Diaz was so keen to leave Madrid that last month he bought a wooden show house in the mountains of Guadalix de la Sierra as soon as he visited it, rather than wait for a new house to be built for him.

""Having to work remotely led me to reconsider what I needed: a place outside Madrid, with more space, separate rooms,"" the 34-year-old solar power engineer said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - During his 27-year pontificate, Pope John Paul II canonised so many people that some dubbed the Vatican ""the saint factory"".
Now, the Polish pope's own legacy is under a shadow and some Catholics are asking if declaring him a saint in 2014, a record nine years after his death, may have been a hasty decision.
Last week, the Vatican issued its report on ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a star of the U.S. Church who was expelled from the priesthood last year after an internal investigation found him guilty of sexual abuses of minors and adults and abuse of power.
It showed that John Paul had promoted McCarrick in 2000 to be archbishop of Washington DC despite persistent rumours of sexual misconduct, believing his personal denial and overruling several senior Church officials who had advised him against it.
The report rekindled a debate between John Paul's defenders and detractors that had accompanied his canonisation - an official recognition that a person lived and died in such an exemplary manner that they are with God in heaven and worthy of public veneration - or ""cult"" - across the Church. 
""Saints are human beings, and saints, in their humanity, can be deceived,"" wrote papal biographer George Weigel.
""DIFFICULT RECKONING"" 
The head of the Polish bishops' conference said McCarrick had ""cynically deceived"" John Paul, but not all Poles agreed. In Warsaw, someone placed a sticker on a street sign reading ""John Paul II Avenue"" to make it read ""Victims of John Paul II Avenue"".
In the United States, the influential National Catholic Reporter newspaper urged bishops to ""suppress the cult"" of the late pope. That meant that, while he would still be considered a saint, schools or churches should not bear his name and activities of devotion towards him should be private.
""It is time for a difficult reckoning. This man ... undermined the global Church's witness, shattered its credibility as an institution, and set a deplorable example for bishops in ignoring the accounts of abuse victims,"" its editorial said.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said he had no comment. 
The McCarrick Report said John Paul's willingness to believe the former cardinal's denial was likely to have been influenced by his experience in his Poland, when communists used false abuse allegations to weaken the Church.
John Paul's defenders have offered the same explanation to counter allegations that he turned a blind eye to Father Marcial Maciel, the Mexican founder of the Legionaries of Christ religious order who was the Church's most notorious sexual abuser.
""MODELS TO BE IMITATED""
""The problems that have arisen over John Paul's treatment of McCarrick prove that it is a mistake to be too hasty in canonising anyone,"" said Father Tom Reese, senior analyst for the independent Religion News Service.
""I oppose canonising popes because it is often more about Church politics than sanctity,"" he said. ""Saints are supposed to be models to be imitated. How can you model yourself after a pope unless you are a pope?""
John Paul canonised nearly 500 saints, compared to 300 in the previous 600 years.
He changed an earlier rule that the process leading to canonisation, known as a cause, could not start until 50 years after a person's death. He cut it to five years and permitted fast-track exceptions. 
When Pope Benedict XVI was elected in 2005, he waived the rule, allowing John Paul's cause to start only weeks after his death.
Catholic author Dawn Eden Goldstein tweeted that the McCarrick Report had not changed her belief that John Paul was a saint, but had changed how she prays to him:

""I now pray: Dear St. John Paul II, You broke it. You fix it.""

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government has been at odds with European partners for years over a perceived erosion of democratic standards, which has sidelined Orban and his Polish allies in the bloc.
The EU's top forum decided over the summer that it would tie any future fund disbursement to respecting the democratic standards incorporated in the EU's founding treaty, such as the freedom of courts, the media and education, all of which have come under attack by Orban in recent years.
Orban's Fidesz party has been suspended by the European People's Party, the bloc's conservative umbrella group for right-wing politicians, and the European Parliament has started a procedure to suspend Hungary's voting rights in the bloc in response to its democratic shortcomings.
The Hungarian leader, who is building a self-styled ""illiberal democracy"", has rejected those accusations and accused Brussels of double standards of allowing other countries to do things Hungary is punished for.
Portfolio reported that the German EU presidency will ask member states later on Monday to express their political stance on the funding conditionality, where the Hungarian government would veto both the EU budget and the post-COVID recovery fund.

Reuters was not able to verify portfolio.hu's information immediately. The Foreign Ministry and the government spokesman did not immediately reply requests for comment.

Moroccan national Ayoub el Khazzani was heavily armed when he launched his attack moments after the train crossed into France from Belgium on Aug. 21, 2015.
Khazzani is accused of attempted murder with intent to commit terrorism and association with terrorist networks, among other charges. He faces life in jail if convicted.
A French citizen was the first to tackle Khazzani after a gunshot rung out in a carriage before the three Americans, two of whom were in the military at the time, rushed the attacker and disarmed him.
A judicial source said Khazzani had confessed to planning the attack to investigators but had said he only intended to attack U.S. soldiers on leave, and not civilians. He told investigators he decided against the attack at the last second but that it was too late to avoid the confrontation with passengers, the source added. 
France was at the time still recovering from the trauma of attacks in Paris seven months earlier against the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. Three months later, a squad of jihadists would strike again, killing 130 people in coordinated attacks on the capital.
""One need only know that Ayoub El Khazzani was in possession of 300 rounds of ammunition and firearms to understand what we narrowly avoided, a tragedy, a massacre,” France's then president, Francois Hollande, said days after the attack at a ceremony to award the American friends the Legion of Honour. 
Clint Eastwood, the U.S. actor and director, made a movie based on the events entitled 'The 15:17 to Paris'
Prosecutors have said Khazzani's attack was premeditated. He allegedly listened to audio on social media calling on Muslims to take up arms in the name of the Prophet, they said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's federal government and states are considering new COVID-19 measures to halt the rise in infections, such as dramatically reducing the number of people at household gatherings and compulsory mask wearing for school students.
A draft document of the measures, seen by Reuters, also said people would be urged to abstain from private parties completely until Christmas.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and the heads of Germany's 16 states are expected meet on Monday. 
Germany this month imposed a set of measures dubbed a ""lockdown light"" to rein in the second wave of the pandemic that the country is seeing in common with much of the rest of Europe. While bars and restaurants are closed, schools and shops so far remain open. 
As a result, numbers of new infections are no longer growing exponentially, but a decrease of infection numbers is not yet foreseeable, the document said.
""Further efforts are needed (...) We have four difficult winter months ahead of us before hopefully seasonal effects and the start of vaccinations will allow us to gradually overcome the pandemic"", the document said.
According to the proposals, which could still change pending the discussion between the federal and regional governments, private gatherings in public will only be possible of people from one household with two people from another household, compared to a maximum of 10 people from two households now.
Schools will see all students wearing masks, compared to some exceptions for elementary schools currently. All classes will be halved to allow more space between individual students. 
All people considered vulnerable will be eligible once a week for one heavy duty respirator mask, also known as FFP2. 
On Nov. 23, Merkel and the regional state heads will meet again and possibly decide further measures, taking into account the development of infection numbers by then. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic 520,000 COVID-19 cases have been detected in Germany by the end of October, but numbers spiked by 50% to 780,000 cases in the first two weeks of November. 
In the same period, the number of COVID-19-intensive care patients in German hospitals increased by 70%, leading to regional bottlenecks.

Over the weekend, a slew of German policy makers warned against easing of current measures and warned of tough times ahead.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Shaken by the world's second deadliest coronavirus outbreak and deep economic crisis, Brazilians voted on Sunday for experienced politicians from traditional parties in local elections, a move that may damage reelection hopes for President Jair Bolsonaro.
Candidates backed by the far-right populist president, who presents himself as an outsider, were knocked out of the running in the country's largest city Sao Paulo and other municipal races in state capitals.
In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's second largest, a former mayor Eduardo Paes led the election and will face incumbent mayor, evangelical bishop Marcelo Crivella, in a runoff in two weeks.
In Salvador, the fourth city, voters elected Bruno Reis of the Democrats party (DEM), which won mayoral races in Curitiba and Florianópolis and is favored to win Rio with Paes.
In Belo Horizonte, the sixth largest city, voters re-elected Alexandre Kalil, who took tough quarantine and social distancing steps that were criticized by Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly downplayed the gravity of COVID-19.
""The pandemic has put the brakes on the trend towards anti-politics and rejection of traditional parties for being corrupt,"" said Creomar de Souza, head of Brasilia-based consultancy Dharma Political Risk and Strategy.
""Voters understood that the politicians elected with Bolsonaro in 2018 are flawed and they want to see public services improve,"" he added.
The results are a setback for Bolsonaro and indicate that the wave of anti-establishment sentiment that got him elected in 2018 following the widespread political corruption uncovered by the Car Wash graft investigation may have subsided.
As voters look to traditional parties, like the DEM and the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB), which is leading the race for Sao Paulo mayor, Bolsonaro appears vulnerable because he has no party.
The Social Liberal Party (PSL) he joined for his presidential campaign and later fell out with was nowhere to be seen in major city races on Sunday, despite having surged two years ago to become the second largest in Congress.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered a tightening of state emergency anti-coronavirus systems in the face of the worldwide pandemic, as he presided over a meeting of the politburo of the ruling Workers Party, state news agency KCNA said on Monday.
The meeting came amid economic and political uncertainty surrounding the global COVID-19 pandemic that is putting additional pressure on the North’s economy, already battered by international sanctions aimed at stopping its nuclear program.
Making his first public appearance in 25 days, Kim stressed the need to keep a high alert and intensify the anti-epidemic work, KCNA reported. 
The meeting discussed an unspecified ""serious crime"" committed by party officials at the Pyongyang University of Medicine. Other officials at the Central Committee and other government agencies ""shielded, connived and fostered the crime"" by failing to tighten oversight over the university, KCNA said, but did not specify if the crime was related to the coronavirus. 
North Korea had tested over 12,000 people and reported no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, as of early November, according to the World Health Organization.
A total of 6,173 people, eight of whom were foreigners, were detected as suspected cases and 174 people were quarantined in the last week of October, the WHO said.
More than 54 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 1,312,334​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.
Kim had called on his country to embark on an 80-day campaign to attain its goals in every sector before a congress in January to decide a new five-year plan.
North Korea's premier, Kim Tok Hun, visited a heavy machine complex and a notebook factory to the southeast of Pyongyang to discuss efforts to reach those goals, KCNA reported on Monday.

""At the Taean Heavy Machine Complex, he gave pep-talks to its workers working hard to produce custom-built equipment ahead of schedule amid the intensive 80-day campaign,"" KCNA reported.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel moved ahead on Sunday with a settler housing plan in a sensitive area near East Jerusalem, a step critics said was aimed at shoring up the project before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
On its website, the Israel Land Authority (ILA) invited contractor bids for building 1,257 homes in Givat Hamatos, under a plan revived in February by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after it had been effectively frozen by international opposition.
Bidding ends on Jan. 18, the ILA said, two days before Biden is to be sworn in to replace President Donald Trump, whose administration has been supportive of Israeli settlement on occupied land Palestinians seek for a state.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said in a statement that settlements were illegal under international law and the tender was part of Israeli efforts ""to kill the internationally-backed two-state solution"".
Opponents of the project say it would sever parts of East Jerusalem from the nearby Palestinian town of Bethlehem in the West Bank, an issue European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell raised, saying he was ""deeply worried"" by the tender. 
""This is a key location between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. Any settlement construction will cause serious damage to the prospects for a viable and contiguous Palestinian State,"" Borrell said in a statement. 
The ILA gave no date for the start of construction.
Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement group, accused Netanyahu's government of ""taking advantage of the final weeks of the Trump administration in order to set facts on the ground"" at Givat Hamatos.
Israel cites historical, political and biblical links to the West Bank and over 440,000 Israeli settlers live there, among three million Palestinians.
As vice president in Democrat Barack Obama's administration, Biden, on a visit to Israel and the West Bank in 2010, publicly scolded Israel over a plan it announced during his trip to build 1,600 homes in the Ramat Shlomo settlement.
But Biden said during the recent presidential campaign that he will not reverse Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem, whose future status is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as Israel’s capital.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said Washington no longer viewed Jewish settlements in areas captured in the 1967 Middle East war as ""inconsistent with international law"". He is to visit Israel as part of a foreign trip now under way.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova opposition candidate Maia Sandu, who favours closer ties with the European Union, promised to unite the country and tackle corruption as she looked on course to beat pro-Moscow incumbent Igor Dodon in a presidential run-off on Sunday.
Workers at Sandu's campaign office chanted ""victory"" after the former World Bank economist won 53.38% of votes compared to 46.62% for Dodon, with 96.55% of ballots counted. An exit poll had put Sandu on 54.8% of votes compared to 45.2% for Dodon. 
The West and Russia vie for influence in the former Soviet republic of 3.5 million, which is one of Europe's poorest nations and has suffered a sharp economic downturn during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We need the state to work for citizens, not for thieves and corrupt officials,"" Sandu said. 
Dodon, who on Friday had called on supporters to take to the streets if he felt the election was stolen from him, on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said: ""I urge everyone to calm, regardless of the election results."" 
Opinion polls had put the rivals neck-and-neck before the election run-off. Sandu finished ahead in the first round two weeks ago with a late surge in support from voters living abroad, but failed to secure enough votes for outright victory. 
Known for her tough stance on corruption, Sandu led a short-lived government last year that was felled by a no-confidence vote.
Sandu, 48, has said she would secure more financial support from the EU as president. Dodon, 45, has been in power since 2016 and has said he will roll out a settlement next year for the breakaway Russian-speaking region of Transdniestria.
""I voted for the development of the economy, for a balanced foreign policy,"" Dodon said after casting his ballot. ""I don't want Moldova to be used in geopolitical games.""
POLITICAL INSTABILITY
If Sandu wins, she is likely to seek a snap parliamentary election to consolidate power because parliament is controlled by the Socialists, Dodon's former party. 
Moldova, squeezed between Ukraine and EU-member Romania, has suffered political instability in the past decade.
""A victory in the second round by Maia Sandu would mean a period of tough political confrontation for Moldova,"" said independent analyst Corneliu Ciurea.
The EU forged a deal on closer trade and political ties with Moldova in 2014, but became increasingly critical of its record on reforms.
Sandu has received messages of support from German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and former European Council President Donald Tusk. Some of Dodon's supporters denounced such support as an attempt to destabilise Moldova.

Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR Foreign Intelligence Service, accused the United States last month of plotting to instigate mass protests against Dodon as punishment for him fostering good relations with Moscow.

Russia has deployed troops as part of a Moscow-brokered ceasefire deal to end six weeks of fighting between ethnic Armenian forces and Azeri troops over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas.
Ethnic Armenians have set fire to their homes, severed electricity cables and cut down trees before leaving the area that is to be handed over to Baku's control.
But Father Ovanes, the superior of the monastery, said he would not leave, regardless of whether there were Russian peacekeepers stationed there to protect him.
""I was prepared and I said: I'm not getting out of here,"" he told Reuters.
Azerbaijan was initially expected to take over the Kalbajar region, controlled by ethnic Armenians since the end of the first war over Nagorno-Karabakh in 1994, on Sunday.
But Baku has extended the deadline until Nov. 25, presidential administration official Hikmet Gadjiyev said.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has told his Azeri counterpart Ilham Aliyev to take care of Christian shrines in parts of Nagorno-Karabakh that Azerbaijan gets under the deal, the Kremlin said on Saturday.
Reuters reporters saw Russian peacekeepers guarding a newly established checkpoint next to the monastery. An armoured personnel carrier was parked in front of a chapel, and troops took selfies with the clergy inside.
""We are happy that our Russian soldiers, our brothers are here to protect the border and to protect this monastery, and the monastery will bless them and protect them,"" said Father Moses, a clergyman.
Peacekeepers might be allowed to remain at the monastery as a result of negotiations which are still ongoing, Father Ovanes said.
The clergy has taken down church bells and cross-stones and sent them out of the region, fearing they could be desecrated and vandalised. 
The monastery overlooks a village that was burnt down and abandoned by its residents after the peace deal.
Most residents had already left the Kalbajar district by Sunday, but some Armenian soldiers stayed behind to finish demolishing the houses in another village called Knaravan.
Reuters reporters saw them taking down electricity poles, sawing them and loading them into a truck next to a school that had its windows smashed and roof torn off.

""We don't want to leave to the enemy, to Azerbaijan, what belonged to us. We just try to keep what belonged to us,"" said one of the soldiers who declined to give his name.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Iota is rapidly gathering strength as it barrels toward Central America, a region still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Eta, and experts predict this year's unprecedented storm season will force more people to migrate.
As of 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT) Sunday, Hurricane Iota was about 315 miles (507 km) off the Nicaraguan-Honduran coast, packing maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour (145 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC). 
""The hurricane is expected to bring potentially catastrophic winds, a life-threatening storm surge, and extreme rainfall impacts to Central America,"" the NHC warned.
Authorities are warning that Hurricane Iota could exacerbate the massive destruction wrought by Hurricane Eta, which slammed into the region two weeks ago, causing flooding and mudslides that destroyed crops and killed scores of people across a huge swath from Panama to southern Mexico. 
The unprecedented 2020 hurricane season comes as Central America is facing an economic crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic, with experts warning the compounding hardship could fuel a new round of migration from the region.
""Increased movements across borders are now more likely, including of people fleeing violence and persecution,"" said Giovanni Bassu, the regional representative for Central America and Cuba for the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), in a statement on Friday.
The UNHCR said that climate change is increasing the intensity of both rain and droughts across Central America, and that ""such phenomena can exacerbate poverty and conditions of insecurity which continue to drive people to flee their communities."" 
Last week, Guatemala requested that the United States allow its nationals in the U.S. to remain there on humanitarian grounds following Eta, under a provision known as temporary protected status, or TPS.
Evacuations are already under way in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua in areas expected to be affected by Iota, which is slated to smash into the jungles of the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua and Honduras on Monday.
In Honduras, Douglas Espinal, head of the fire department of Puerto Lempira on the Mosquito Coast, told Reuters that evacuees have been arriving since early Saturday, traveling from the region's remote peninsulas.
""People are coming from the coastal areas, but only those who have a boat or a canoe. The rest are staying in their communities,"" he said.
Espinal said Puerto Lempira has run out of fuel since deliveries were suspended following Hurricane Eta, making it impossible for the fire department to carry out a more extensive evacuation plan. 
Puerto Lempira is the largest municipality in the Honduran department of Gracias a Dios, a remote region accessible only by air, sea or by traversing its internal rivers. With just over 100,000 residents, according to the National Institute of Statistics, the area is home to a number of indigenous communities, including Miskitos, Garifunas, Pech and Tawhakas.
Puerto Lempira is still recovering from massive flooding sparked by Eta that caused property damage and crop losses.

In Nicaragua, authorities said evacuations are also underway in the indigenous and fishing communities on the Mosquito Coast.

Pre-selected lists headed by the party, which strongly supports Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, won all 284 seats allocated for the 596-seat chamber through a winner-takes-all system.
Its candidates also won 59 of the 73 seats contested by individual candidates that have so far been declared by the commission.
Remaining individual seats will be decided in run-offs later this month and in early December. Sisi can appoint 28 legislators directly.
Turnout in the two rounds of voting in an election that began on Oct. 24 was 29% so far, according to the election commission.
Many candidates and parties filed legal complaints to the commission alleging electoral fraud, but all have so far been dismissed. Some have also taken complaints to the courts.
The commission's head, Lasheen Ibrahim, appealed to Egyptians to participate in the run-offs, urging them not to listen to rumours spread by ""enemies of the homeland"".
Parliament was already controlled by Sisi supporters, but Nation's Future has emerged as a dominant force and won nearly 75% of contested seats for Egypt's newly recreated Senate in August.

Sisi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on political dissent since leading the removal in 2013 of the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, who was freely elected in 2012 before mass protests engulfed his rule.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The leader of Ethiopia's rebellious Tigray region confirmed on Sunday that his forces had fired rockets at the airport in Eritrea's capital, a major escalation that raises fears of a wider war in the Horn of Africa region. 
Accusing neighbouring Eritrea of sending tanks and thousands of troops into Tigray in support of an Ethiopian government offensive, Debretsion Gebremichael said his forces were under attack ""on several fronts.""
""Our country is attacking us with a foreign country, Eritrea. Treason!,"" Debretsion said in text messages to Reuters, without providing further details or evidence of his claims. 
With access restricted and most communications down in Tigray, Reuters could not independently verify assertions made by all sides about the 12-day conflict. 
Government officials in Eritrea and the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa could not be reached for comment. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed tweeted Sunday that Ethiopia was more than capable of achieving its objectives in Tigray ""by itself"" but did not specifically address Debretsion's claims. 
Last week, Eritrean Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed told Reuters: ""We are not part of the conflict.""
The U.S. State Department's top diplomat for Africa, Tibor Nagy, denounced the attacks by Tigrayan forces on Eritrea and condemned what he called their ""efforts to internationalize the conflict in Tigray"".
Abiy launched the campaign in Tigray on Nov. 4 after accusing local forces of attacking federal troops based in the northern state, which borders Eritrea and Sudan and is home to some 5 million people. 
The government accuses Tigray's leaders of treason and says its military operations are aimed at restoring the rule of law. Tigrayans dominated the governing coalition before Abiy, an Oromo, came to power in 2018. They say he has marginalised them since, which Abiy denies.
The conflict has killed hundreds on both sides and threatens to destabilize other parts of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa. At least 20,000 Ethiopians have fled into Sudan, the United Nations said on Sunday. 
The International Crisis Group, a think-tank, warned on Nov. 5 that any involvement by Eritrea in the conflict could in turn draw in Sudan.
Egypt and Sudan launched a joint military exercise on Saturday, according to Egypt's defence ministry. The neighbours are deepening their ties amid a dispute with Ethiopia over the giant dam that Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile.
Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute, said the conflict would ""turn the Horn of Africa into an international theatre of war"" and that by drawing in rival regional forces it would ""change the nature and terms of the proxy wars already being fought in Yemen, North Africa and the Middle East.”
DEVASTATING WAR
Eritrea and Ethiopia fought a devastating 1998-2000 war. Abiy won a Nobel Peace Prize last year for making peace with Ethiopia's neighbour, but Eritrea's government remains hostile to the Tigray leadership after their leading role in that war.
Five regional diplomats told Reuters that at least three rockets were fired at Eritrea's capital from Ethiopia on Saturday night.
Debretsion told Reuters that Eritrea had sent 16 divisions to Ethiopia but did not provide specific troop numbers. Eritrea has a vast standing army which the United States' CIA puts at 200,000 personnel. 
Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) also accused Ethiopia of deploying drones from a military base in Eritrea belonging to the United Arab Emirates.
""Abiy is now enlisting the support of UAE drones based in Assab in his devastating war against the people of Tigray,"" party spokesman Getachew Reda said in a tweet on Sunday.
Reuters could not independently confirm that and UAE officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Several Ethiopian refugees arriving in the Sudanese town of Hamdayat told Reuters on Saturday that their areas had been shelled from Eritrea. Reuters could not independently verify this.
Fighting has spilled into Ethiopia's Amhara state, whose local forces are fighting with federal troops in Tigray. Late on Friday, rockets were fired at two airports in Amhara in what the TPLF said was retaliation for government air strikes.

The EU's European Affairs ministers are expected to discuss launching accession negotiations with North Macedonia on Nov. 17. If any country votes against the framework for negotiations, accession talks cannot be formally launched.
""Bulgaria is saying 'No' to the start of negotiations, we are not saying 'No' to North Macedonia's accession to the EU,"" Zaharieva told private broadcaster BTV on Sunday.
She said North Macedonia is not delivering on the friendship treaty between the two Balkan neighbours signed in 2017 and has policies based on hatred towards Bulgaria.
Sofia wants its neighbour to recognise that its nation and language have Bulgarian roots and it wants it to put an end to anti-Bulgarian rhetoric. Skopje argues that its identity and language are not open to discussion.
Despite talks in the past month that also included Germany, which hopes negotiations with North Macedonia can begin while Berlin has the EU rotating presidency until the end of the year, the Balkan neighbours have yet to reach an agreement.
""No-one is disputing their right to self-define their nation and call their language what they like. But we cannot agree that this right will be based on hatred, history theft and denial of Bulgaria,"" Zaharieva said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called for an equal ""two-state"" solution in Cyprus during a visit on Sunday to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north of the island, drawing a rebuke from the internationally recognised government in the south.
Erdogan also said Turkey and Northern Cyprus would no longer tolerate what he called ""diplomacy games"" in an international dispute over rights to offshore resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Cyprus has been split along ethnic lines since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Only Ankara recognises Northern Cyprus as an independent state and it has no diplomatic relations with the government of Cyprus, which is a member of the European Union.
""Our priority is to ensure a fair, lasting and sustainable solution"" in Cyprus that ensures Turkish Cypriots have security and legal rights, Erdogan told an audience after his arrival.
""A two-state solution must be negotiated on the basis of sovereign equality,"" he added.
United Nations-mediated peace talks on Cyprus broke down in 2017.
Erdogan was visiting Northern Cyprus after Ersin Tatar, who also supports a two-state solution, won last month's presidential election. Tatar's predecessor had backed reunification of the island. 
Cyprus called Erdogan's visit ""provocative and illegal"".
""Ankara has absolutely no respect for international law, European principles and values, and its obligations towards the EU,"" the Cypriot presidency said in a statement.
MUSCLE-FLEXING 
Erdogan later visited Varosha, a beach town that has been fenced-off and abandoned in no-man's land since 1974. 
Ankara backed the partial re-opening of Varosha just before last month's election in a move criticised by the United States, Greece and Greek Cypriots. 
Turkey has increasingly flexed its military muscle in the region, including by backing Azerbaijan in its renewed conflict with Armenia over the past few weeks.
Erdogan alluded to Turkey's dispute with EU members Greece and Cyprus and with other neighbours over territorial waters in the eastern Mediterranean.
The EU has threatened to impose sanctions on Turkey next month over illegal exploration at sea.
""Neither we nor Northern Cyprus can tolerate diplomacy games (in the region) anymore,"" Erdogan said. 
He added that Tatar would soon visit Azerbaijan - which does not recognise Northern Cyprus - to ""make the situation better"", without elaborating.
Tatar backed Erdogan's calls for a two-state solution and offshore rights.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Sunday denied allegations by its arch-rival Pakistan that New Delhi had helped fund militant groups on Pakistani soil, with a foreign ministry spokesman dismissing them as ""fabricated"" and ""figments of imagination"".
Pakistan's foreign minister said on Saturday the country would present its evidence to the United Nations and other international bodies.
""This desperate attempt will find few takers as the international community is aware of Pakistan's tactics,"" India's foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said in a statement.
He added that Pakistan itself funds militants - an allegation Islamabad also denies.
The nuclear-armed neighbours - that have fought three wars since both won independence from colonial power Britain - have long accused each other of equipping insurgents. 
But Saturday's announcement by Pakistan's foreign minister and military at a news conference in the capital Islamabad provided a heightened level of detail and specific accusations. 
They said they had obtained documents that showed New Delhi had met with and funded members of the Pakistani Taliban, as well as Baloch insurgent groups from the southern province of Balochistan who have claimed responsibility for attacks on Chinese interests as part of an effort to sabotage China's $65 billion Belt and Road investment plan in Pakistan.

India, meanwhile, has long alleged that Pakistan has founded, trained and funded secessionist militant groups operating in the Kashmir valley, a Himalayan region claimed by both countries but administered by New Delhi.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarusian police detained hundreds of people who took to the streets in mass demonstrations on Sunday chanting ""I'm going out"", the last known written words of an anti-governmemt protester who died last week.
A witness in the capital Minsk said police had used tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse the crowds demonstrating against President Alexander Lukashenko. 
Belarus has been mired in political crisis for months. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets every week since an election in August that they say was rigged, something Lukasheko denies. They want the veteran leader, in power for 26 years, to resign.
The street rallies were re-ignited following the death of Roman Bondarenko, a 31-year old anti-government protester. He died in hospital in Minsk on Thursday following what demonstrators said was a severe beating by security forces.
The interior ministry has denied responsibility for Bondarenko's death, saying he was killed in a scuffle with civilians. 
Security forces in riot gear and shields on Sunday flooded the square where Bondarenko was detained, pulling down opposition flags, kicking over memorial lamps and dragging people from the crowds and frog-marching them to vans, a witness said. 
ARRESTS
Video footage by local media also showed security forces entering apartments in the area in search of protesters. A video clip posted on social media showed three men in riot gear attending to a man who appeared to be unconscious.
The Viasna (Spring) human rights group said 504 people had been detained so far by police so far during Sunday's protests around the country.
Hundreds of protesters, wearing the red-and-white colours that have come to represent the protest movement, had gathered on Sunday for a vigil near Bondarenko's house in Minsk.
Witnesses said Bondarenko was detained after scuffling with people in plain clothes who had come to a playground to remove red-and-white ribbons.
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main opponent, who fled into exile in Lithuania after the election, said on social media she supported Sunday's rallies in memory of Bondarenko.
The European Union has called Bondarenko's death ""an outrageous and shameful result of the actions by the Belarusian authorities... (who have) directly and violently carried out repression of their own population"".

Police have arrested thousands of people during months of protests, and rights groups say hundreds of detainees have reported being subjected to beatings and other rights abuses.

The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said the number of people killed was likely to rise after what it called a ""gruesome"" attack on the passenger bus in the Benishangul-Gumuz region. It said there were reports of ""similar"" attacks, and of people fleeing the violence, in other parts of the region.
“The latest attack is a grim addition to the human cost which we bear collectively,"" Daniel Bekele, commission head, said in a statement.
He urged regional and federal authorities to work together on a strategy for Benishangul-Gumuz due to the ""unrelenting pace"" of attacks there. Armed militia men killed at least 45 people in the same region in September, according to the Ethiopian government.
The violence comes amid a 12-day-old war between the Ethiopian government and the restive Tigray region in the country's north. Experts say that conflict could encourage other ethnic groups to exploit the chaos to push for more autonomy, while the redeployment of forces to Tigray could leave other regions exposed.

PARIS (Reuters) - French police stepped up controls in Paris over the weekend to ensure residents were complying with strict lockdown rules imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, amid signs that some people were breaching them.
Prime Minister Jean Castex has said people are not abiding by the rules as strictly as during the first lockdown back in the spring.
Police had to break up an illegal party hosting up to 400 people at Joinville-Le-Pont near Paris early on Saturday.
Under the lockdown, in force since the end of October, people must stay indoors apart from trips to buy food or other essential goods, or for a brief hour of exercise. They must also carry signed documents to justify why they are outside.
Police were checking motorists travelling through the Bois de Boulogne in western Paris to make sure they had the necessary signed documents and were wearing masks, as required by the law.
A French landscape gardener who gave his name as Jules said he had noticed a pick-up in police controls.
""I find there were a lot of checks during the first lockdown, while it has been light in terms of checks in the beginning of this one, to be honest,"" said Jules, who was checked while out on his moped.
""However, I did notice that checks have been tightened over the past three days.""
Jules had his papers in order but construction worker Stephane was not so lucky. He had forgotten to download the necessary form onto his mobile phone to explain why he was out on his moped and so was handed a 135 euro ($169) fine.
""It is a mistake due to carelessness. I normally generate it but I didn't this time. Yes, forgetting it is quite expensive,"" said Stephane.

CHENNAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Hundreds of millions of Indians in north India woke up on Sunday to toxic air following Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, after many revellers defied bans on using firecrackers to celebrate. 
The capital New Delhi was blanketed with a thick haze, with the average pollution level over 9 times what is considered safe by the World Health Organization.
Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had banned the use and sale of firecrackers ahead of Diwali, but the policy has been difficult to implement.
Revellers in the capital let off huge amounts of fireworks well into Sunday morning, prompting angry residents and environmentalists to complain on social media of breathing difficulties and stinging eyes. 
""Our gods must be so happy today, that their followers burst firecrackers and choked the young ones to despair and death,"" said Vimlendu Jha, the founder of non-profit environmental group Swechha.
Some defended firecrackers as an essential part of a religious tradition celebrated by millions across the country.
""Are you realizing how all of India, all places stood up in defiance against the cracker ban? It's like a form of Hindu- freedom battle cry,"" Tarun Vijay, a leader of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, tweeted.
New Delhi's air pollution typically worsens in October and November due to farmers burning agricultural waste, coal-fired power plants, traffic and windless days.
The raging coronavirus epidemic, with more than 400,000 cases in the city of 20 million people, has also heightened alarm over the smog. Doctors have warned of a sharp increase in respiratory illnesses.
Cities in the states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar and New Delhi - which have already been suffering from some of the worst air in the world - saw even higher levels of pollution than on the morning after Diwali last year, government data analyzed by Reuters showed.
An average of air quality indices measured at different places within the major cities in these states was higher than last year, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian interim President Manuel Merino came under growing pressure on Sunday to resign after half his new cabinet stepped down following the deaths of two people in protests over the sudden ouster of his predecessor.
Thousands of Peruvians have staged some of the country's largest protests in decades - mostly peaceful but some marred by clashes - since the Congress voted last Monday to remove Martin Vizcarra as president over bribery allegations, which he denies.
The political shakeup has come as Peru, the world's no. 2 copper producer, battles the coronavirus pandemic and what is expected to be its worst economic contraction in a century.
Protesters filled plazas in downtown Lima on Saturday afternoon, with demonstrations beginning peacefully but growing more intense by nightfall. Two young protesters were killed in clashes, the public ombudsman confirmed.
After the violence, at least nine cabinet ministers - sworn in on Thursday - announced their resignations, while calls grew for the departure of Merino, the former head of Congress who had led the push to impeach Vizcarra and who took over last Tuesday.
""President Merino should present his resignation at this time,"" the new head of Congress, center-right lawmaker Luis Valdéz told local station América Televisión early on Sunday, adding he had called for an urgent meeting of legislators.
The national assembly of Peru's regional governments also released a statement demanding Merino's resignation, saying he was ""politically responsible for the acts of violence"".
Prime Minister Ántero Flores-Aráoz said in an interview with RPP radio that if Merino resigned he would depart also. ""I owe him respect, consideration and loyalty, I cannot leave him alone,"" he said.
FIREWORKS AND TEAR GAS
On Saturday hundreds of mostly young protesters unveiled a massive Peruvian flag and sang the national anthem in the central Plaza San Martín. Later, a band of hooded protesters confronted police, throwing rocks and fireworks at them, and security forces fired back with tear gas.
The city echoed with sirens, shouts and chants of protesters demanding Merino's removal.
Flores-Aráoz had earlier told reporters that Vizcarra's removal on corruption charges by the opposition-dominated Congress had been legal. He said Merino had no intention of caving to demands from protesters that he resign.
""This was a constitutional change,"" Flores-Aráoz said. ""We ask people for understanding. We don't want to descend into chaos and anarchy.""
Though the protests seen in Lima since Monday have been mostly peaceful, dozens have been injured in sporadic clashes between demonstrators and security forces.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to tame the unrest, and humans rights groups said their use of force was excessive.
""Given the situation, young people cannot be indifferent, we must demand respect,"" said Sonia Julca, an economist from the University of Callao. ""The people are against this government led by Merino.""
Merino, a member of the center-right Popular Action party, has called for calm and promised to stick with a plan for new presidential elections in April.
Vizcarra, a politically unaffiliated centrist who is popular with Peruvians, oversaw an anti-graft campaign that led to frequent clashes with Congress in a country that has a history of political upheaval and corruption. 

The former president has yet to be found guilty of the corruption charges brought against him during the impeachment hearing prior to his ouster.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldovan voters will decide on Sunday whether to give pro-Moscow President Igor Dodon four more years in office or hand power to Maia Sandu, a former prime minister who favours closer ties with the European Union.
The central election commission said voting began in more than 2,000 polling stations in the country and abroad. 
Opinion polls put the rivals neck-and-neck before the election run-off. Sandu finished ahead in the first round two weeks ago with a late surge in support from diaspora voters, but failed to secure enough votes for outright victory.
The West and Russia vie for influence in the former Soviet republic of 3.5 million, which is one of Europe's poorest nations and has suffered a sharp economic downturn during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A former World Bank economist who takes a tough stance on corruption, Sandu led a short-lived government last year that was felled by a no-confidence vote.
Sandu, 48, has said she would secure more financial support from the EU as president. Dodon, 45, has been in power since 2016 and has said he will roll out a settlement next year for the breakaway Russian-speaking region of Transdniestria.
If Sandu wins, she is likely to seek a snap parliamentary election to consolidate power because parliament is controlled by the Socialists, Dodon's former party. 
Moldova, squeezed between Ukraine and EU-member Romania, has suffered political instability in the past decade.
""A victory in the second round by Maia Sandu would mean a period of tough political confrontation for Moldova,"" said independent analyst Corneliu Ciurea.
The EU forged a deal on closer trade and political ties with Moldova in 2014, but became increasingly critical of its record on reforms.
Sandu has received messages of support from German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and former European Council President Donald Tusk. Some of Dodon's supporters denounced such support as an attempt to destabilise Moldova.

Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR Foreign Intelligence Service, accused the United States last month of plotting to instigate mass protests against Dodon as punishment for him fostering good relations with Moscow.

President Rodrigo Duterte flew to Tuguegarao province to assess the situation in Cagayan Valley region, which was heavily flooded after Typhoon Vamco dumped rain over swathes of the main Luzon island, including the capital, metropolitan Manila. 
Twenty-two fatalities were recorded in Cagayan, 17 in southern Luzon, eight in Metro Manila, and 20 in two other regions, said Mark Timbal, the disaster management agency spokesman.
Twelve people were still missing and nearly 26,000 houses were damaged by Vamco, he said.
""This is the worst flooding that we had in the last 45 years,"" Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba said during a briefing with Duterte. ""We see that it is worsening every year.""
The accumulated effects of weather disturbances and huge volumes of water from a dam affected thousands of families in Cagayan, some of whom had fled to rooftops to escape two-storey high floods.
Six cyclones hit the Philippines in a span of just four weeks, including Vamco and Super Typhoon Goni, the world's most powerful this year.
But Mamba also lamented about denuded forests in Cagayan, prompting Duterte to order him to curb logging operations in the province.
""We always talk about illegal logging and mining but nothing has been done about it,"" Duterte said.
Relief and rescue operations continued in Cagayan even as the nearby Magat Dam was still releasing water, two days after releasing a volume equivalent to two Olympic-size pools per second, based on government data.
Vamco, the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, also caused the worst flooding in years in parts of the capital.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn told well-wishers of the importance of unity as he marked the opening of a new railway line on Saturday, after thousands of protesters had turned their backs on his motorcade as it passed through central Bangkok. 
Around 2,500 demonstrators had gathered at the capital's Democracy Monument in the latest of months of protests against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, demanding changes to the constitution as well as reforms of the monarchy.
The protesters draped the centrepiece of the monument, which has become a rallying point for the protests, in a cloth covered in grievances and insults. “Dictatorship be destroyed, democracy shall prosper,"" shouted protesters who scaled the three-metre structure.
As the motorcade carrying the king and Queen Suthida passed by they turned their backs, gave the three-fingered ""Hunger Games"" salute of pro-democracy campaigners, and sang the national anthem in the latest show of disaffection with the monarchy.
The king was greeted with a show of support when he arrived at the rail ceremony in the west of the city, where thousands of people had gathered in yellow shirts, waving national flags and chanting “long live the king”.
“He told me to show children how important the unity of the country is,” said Donnapha Kladbupha, 48, a teacher who posed for selfies with the king.
The Royal Palace has not commented since the start of the protests, but the king said two weeks ago that the protesters were still loved and that Thailand was a land of compromise.
""Think well, do good, be hopeful, endure. Have unity in being Thai,"" the king wrote on the back of a picture of himself and the queen which had been held up by one supporter. 
The initial focus of protests that began in July was to seek the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. But demonstrators have increasingly called for reforms to the monarchy, breaking a long-standing taboo against criticising the institution - an offence punishable with 15 years in jail.

""Without the people, the government and monarchy will have no power,"" said Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, one of the protest leaders. ""Are they willing to take a step back or find a consensus that we can agree on?""

Claimed by China but democratically ruled, Taiwan enjoyed unprecedented support from President Donald Trump's government, including stepped-up arms sales and visits of top officials to Taipei. Biden's election has caused some unease in Taiwan.
Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan's representative in Washington and close to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, spoke to Blinken by telephone to convey Taiwan's congratulations to Biden, Hsiao said on Twitter on Saturday.
""Appreciated bipartisan support for U.S. relations with Taiwan and hope to continue close cooperation with the U.S. in coming years,"" she added.
Tsai met Blinken in 2015 at the State Department when he was deputy secretary of state and she was the presidential candidate for Taiwan's Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP). 
On that trip, Tsai also became the first Taiwanese presidential candidate to visit the White House, meeting Evan Medeiros, President Barack Obama's senior director for Asian Affairs.
""It is thus clear that the government of the Democratic Party had a friendly attitude towards Taiwan,"" Tsai said in a DPP-issued statement on Wednesday.
With his decades of experience on Capitol Hill, at the White House and as the former No. 2 at the State Department, Blinken is widely seen in Washington as a natural fit to be Biden's national security adviser or a possible pick for secretary of state.
Biden, a Democrat, has not discussed what role Blinken will fill in the new administration.
Tensions over Taiwan have escalated dramatically since Republican Trump took office four years ago, with China mounting regular military drills near the island, including during visits earlier this year to Taipei by senior U.S. officials.

Taiwanese officials are due in Washington this week for trade talks, and the island has expressed confidence these will continue under the new administration, pointing to bipartisan U.S. support for Taiwan.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Iota is strengthening as it barrels toward Central America, with authorities urging communities to evacuate before it unleashes ""life-threatening"" flooding across a region still recovering from Hurricane Eta's devastation.
Iota is expected to intensify to major hurricane strength or just short of it by the time it smashes into the jungles of the Miskito Coast of Nicaragua and Honduras on Monday.
As of 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT), Iota was packing maximum sustained winds of 60 miles (97 km) per hour, according to the U.S. National Weather Center (NHC), as it gathered force over the southern Caribbean Sea about 480 miles (770 km) east-southeast of the Nicaraguan-Honduran coast.
The storm comes as Central America is still coping with the massive destruction wrought by Hurricane Eta, which slammed into the region two weeks ago, causing flooding and mudslides that have killed scores of people across a huge swath stretching from Panama to southern Mexico. 
On Saturday morning, Guatemalan authorities said a mudslide buried 10 people in the state of Chiquimula near the border with Honduras. Emergency workers have rescued two people and recovered three corpses so far. Five people are still missing.
Saturday's mudslide follows last week's partial collapse of a mountain onto the village of Queja, in the central Guatemalan region of Alta Verapaz, which killed and buried alive dozens of residents.
Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on Saturday expressed concern about Iota's approach, saying he has ordered evacuations for areas expected to be affected.
""We are concerned about the area of ​​Alta Verapaz and Quiché. We believe that they are the areas where we could have the greatest impact,"" said Giammattei. ""We hope God helps us."" 
In Honduras, where Eta killed 64 people and damaged roads, bridges and crops, President Juan Orlando Hernández on Saturday urged people in Iota's path to evacuate to the nearest shelters.
""Iota is going to put our lives and our economy at risk again,"" he said.
Residents of the community of Cruz de Valencia in northwestern Honduras have begun evacuating.
""We have to get out, we have to save our lives,"" said resident Erick Gomez, who said he only survived the flooding from the last hurricane by clinging to a tree to avoid being swept away by the rushing water.
""We are afraid of what we just suffered with Eta, and we do not want to go through the same thing again,"" he added.

The NHC is warning Iota could bring flash flooding and mudslides across northern Colombia and Central America as early as Monday.

Pashinyan had come under pressure with thousands of demonstrators protesting since Tuesday and demanding he resign over a ceasefire that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh after six weeks of fighting.
The NSS said its former head Artur Vanetsyan, the former head of the Republican Party parliamentary faction Vahram Baghdasaryan and war volunteer Ashot Minasyan were under arrest.
""The suspects were planning to illegally usurp power by murdering the prime minister and there were already potential candidates being discussed to replace him,"" the NSS said in a statement.
Pashinyan said earlier this week he had no choice but to sign the agreement to prevent further territorial losses. He said he was taking personal responsibility for the setbacks, but rejected calls to step down.
The ceasefire halted military action in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians. Under the agreement, 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are being deployed to the region.

Since the early 1990s, ethnic Armenians had held military control over all of Nagorno-Karabakh and substantial swathes of Azeri territory surrounding it. They have now lost much of the enclave itself as well as the surrounding territory.

Russia brokered a ceasefire on Tuesday that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan around the ethnic Armenian region, where Azeri troops have been battling ethnic Armenian forces over the past six weeks.
Putin told Aliyev there were Christian churches and monasteries in areas of the enclave, internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians, that Azerbaijan obtains under the ceasefire deal.
""In this respect, he (Putin) underscored the importance of securing safety and normal church life of these shrines,"" the Kremlin said.
Aliyev said that was how Azerbaijan will act, according to the Kremlin.
The main religion in Azerbaijan is Islam.
Putin, Aliyev and Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan also discussed ""practical aspects"" of the ceasefire, the Kremlin said. It was not clear if Putin had a call with Aliyev and then another call with Aliyev and Pashinyan, or if he spoke separately with the Armenian leader.
Under the agreement, 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are being deployed to the region. 

Since the early 1990s, ethnic Armenians had held military control over all of Nagorno-Karabakh and substantial swaths of Azeri territory surrounding it. They have now lost much of the enclave itself as well as the surrounding territory.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian soldiers shot dead peaceful protesters at a demonstration in Lagos last month, trucking away the bodies, said written witness testimonies submitted to a judicial panel on Saturday but contradicted by an army general.
""The soldiers kept shooting at random, and I saw people falling to the ground, injured or lifeless,"" said Dabiraoluwa Ayuku in her testimony.
Her account was one of three seen by Reuters, and submitted to the Lagos panel investigating allegations that the army and police opened fire on and killed people protesting at the city's Lekki Toll Gate against police brutality.
The protests, the worst since the country's return to civilian rule in 1999, climaxed in that incident on Oct. 20, when rights group Amnesty International said soldiers and police killed at least 12 protesters in two districts.
Both the army and police have denied killing demonstrators.
In testimony to the panel on Saturday, Brigadier General Ahmed Taiwo, who heads the army's 81st Division in Lagos, said soldiers fired blank rounds only, into the air, to disperse protesters.
When shown a photo by Reuters which he used as testimony to prove the army fired only blanks, he said two bullets among the 11 shown were live rounds, one spent and one unspent. He said they were not the army's, but perhaps from the police.
""If we fired live rounds into that crowd, the casualties will have been too much,"" Taiwo said. ""So we made that judgement, and decided to use blank ammunition.""
Police did not respond to calls seeking comment.
Two of the civilian panel witness said some troops fired into the air, but all three said other soldiers shot peaceful protesters, injuring or killing them. 
""I remember a particular soldier that kept dancing while he shot,"" said Ayuku.
Soldiers removed some protesters' corpses in vans, said two witnesses, one adding that the troops took away bullet casings.
Later that night, police arrived and opened fire on protesters, two witnesses said. One said they saw police shoot dead two men.

Ayuku said she returned the next morning to find blood stains and casings on the floor, while vultures hovered overhead.

GRAN CANARIA (Reuters) - Demonstrators on the Canary Islands on Saturday demanded better living conditions for thousands of migrants who have reached the Spanish archipelago from Africa. 
A slow procession of hundreds of demonstrators, some on foot and some in cars, crossed the island of Gran Canaria before reaching the Arguineguin dock in the town of Mogan, where nearly 2,000 migrants are living in tents in conditions that an immigration judge has called ""inhumane and degrading"". 
Over 700 migrants in small boats were rescued on Saturday, coastguards said, bringing the number of people who have reached the islands by the dangerous Atlantic route from Africa to nearly 17,000 this year - more than 10 times last year's total.
Deepening economic hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic is pushing more people in developing nations to seek better lives elsewhere, while tightened security in the Mediterranean means more migrants are attempting the Atlantic crossing, with many dying along the way.
""We are here fighting for a more dignified reception for these people who arrive in our island to find a better life,"" said one demonstrator, teacher Famara Brito. 
Aid groups estimate about 4,000 migrants are living in tourist hotels because of the lack of refugee reception centres. 
The Federation of Hospitality and Tourism Enterprises of Gran Canaria called on Saturday on the government to act so hotels could be used again for tourists. 

Spain's regional policy minister said on Friday it would expand naval patrols around the Canary Islands and set up more migrant centres in response to the surge in arrivals.

HAMDAYAT, Sudan (Reuters) - Ethiopians fleeing war in the northern Tigray region crossed a border river into neighbouring Sudan on Saturday, some in boats, some swimming or wading through the water. 
Speaking to Reuters in the Sudanese border town of Hamdayat, they gave accounts of the escalating conflict in Tigray state, where government forces are battling fighters loyal to rebellious local leaders. 
The small town is home to a camp hosting 8,000 refugees. Several hundred arrived on Saturday morning with hundreds more crowded onto the rocky bank of the Tekeze river.
Refugees told stories of artillery attacks and shooting in the streets, with fighting spilling over into neighbouring Amhara state. 
With access blocked to Tigray and communications largely down, it was impossible to verify the state of the conflict or to corroborate the refugees' accounts.
""We are hungry and we're afraid that they will kill us,"" said an old woman, referring to government troops battling the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
She spoke moments after paying the owner of a small boat 30 Ethiopian Biir (about 80 U.S. cents) to bring her across the river, while women and children were seen swimming. Refugees said one person drowned while trying to cross the night before.
Niqisti, 42, said her brother was shot dead by government-allied militiamen in front of their home in Humera in Tigray state and her small restaurant was looted. It was not possible to verify her account.
Sudanese officials were registering refugees.
""People are hungry and the flow of refugees is continuing but we have little to offer,"" said Salah Ramadan, head of the border town's administration.
Mubarak Abdallah, a 28-year old Sudanese farmer, said supplies in the local food market were dwindling.
ERITREA
Hundreds of people have been killed since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent the national defence force on an offensive against local troops in Tigray last week, accusing them of attacking federal troops.
Abiy has said government jets were bombing military targets in Tigray, including arms depots and equipment controlled by the Tigrayan forces.
But several refugees said their areas had been shelled by artillery from neighbouring Eritrea to support the Ethiopian army. Reuters could not independently verify this.
Tigray's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, said on Tuesday that Eritrea had sent troops across the border in support of Ethiopian government forces but provided no evidence.
Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed denied this on Friday.
""We were shelled by artillery volleys from across the Eritrean border,"" said Naksiam Guru, a 22-year refugee who lives near the border. ""I saw people dying in the streets.""
Burhani Abraham, 31, who arrived four days ago with his wife and three-year-old child also reported shelling from Eritrea.
""I'm very hungry,"" he said, sitting in the crowded makeshift camp.

A 26-year old farmer from the Tigray region said the TPLF had tried to recruit him but he ran away. He did not want to give his name.""I'm a simple farmer growing corn ... I'm afraid of war and death,"" he said.

About 600 people from the loosely organized Querdenker movement that opposes the government’s measures to halt the rise in coronavirus infections took to the streets in Frankfurt. 
Police used water cannon to free up the route of the rally, which was blocked several times by about 300 people protesting against the Querdenkers.
A police spokesman said the rally was broken up after protesters repeatedly disregarded rules on wearing masks and keeping a distance from each other.
Meanwhile, leading politicians said any quick relaxation of the country's November lockdown was unlikely. Germany has imposed measures dubbed a ""lockdown light"" to rein in a second wave of the pandemic. While restaurants are closed, schools and shops so far remain open.
Health Minister Jens Spahn said at an online event of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party that hard weeks, possibly even months, lie ahead.
""It takes a very long time even with very severe measures (to get infection rates down)"", Spahn said, pointing to the Southern German Berchtesgaden district, which has been in a full lock-down since Oct. 20. 
Bavaria's conservative Prime Minister Markus Soeder said that he does not expect any lockdown rules to be eased before the end of November. 
""Whether they need to be extended? Possibly, we will see,"" he said, adding that decisions would be taken depending how the pandemic evolves in the next two weeks.
And Baden-Wuerttemberg's Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann told daily Augsburger Allgemeine that relaxing lockdown measures at Christmas would be possible only if the rate of new infections decreases in a significant way.

Germany reported a rise of confirmed coronavirus cases by 22,461 to a total 775,556, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday. The reported death toll rose by 178 to 12,378.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan will present evidence to the United Nations and other international bodies that India, its neighbour and arch rival, is involved with militant organisations on its soil, Pakistan's foreign minister said on Saturday. 
Pakistani officials have long claimed that India sponsors violent groups in Pakistan -- claims India has always denied -- but Saturday's announcement at a press conference in the capital Islamabad provided a heightened level of detail and specific accusations.
""We are now presenting irrefutable evidence to the world to demonstrate the Indian state's direct sponsorship of terrorism in Pakistan that has resulted in the deaths of innocent Pakistanis,"" Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told media alongside the spokesperson for the country's military.
A dossier of evidence would be shared with the United Nations and other international agencies, he added.
Reuters sent India's foreign ministry a statement from the media wing of Pakistan's military detailing the allegations but it did not respond to request for comment. 
India not only denies interfering in Pakistan but accuses Islamabad itself of supporting militants who launch attacks in India and fight in Indian-controlled portion of the disputed territory Kashmir, a claim Pakistan denies.
The accusations come at a time of heightened tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours after at least 10 civilians and five security personnel were killed in cross-border shelling along the Line of Control, the de facto border in Kashmir on Friday. 
Pakistan's foreign minister and military said that India's Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) intelligence agency was operating a network of agents and training camps through its diplomatic missions in Afghanistan who were financing, training, and equipping militants operating inside Pakistan. 

They said they had obtained documents that showed New Delhi had met with and funded members of the Pakistani Taliban, as well as Baloch insurgent groups from the southern province of Balochistan who have claimed responsibility for attacks on Chinese interests as part of an effort to sabotage China's $65 billion Belt and Road investment plan in Pakistan.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters rallied in the Georgian capital Tbilisi on Saturday to back opposition calls for a re-run of the Oct. 31 parliamentary election they say was rigged.
According to official results, the ruling Georgian Dream party won 48.23% of the vote, with the largest opposition party, the United National Movement (UNM), taking 27.18%.
Yet the opposition accuses Georgian Dream and its supporters of vote buying, making threats against voters and observers, and of violations during the count. Eight opposition parties including the UNM have said they would boycott parliament. 
Georgian Dream leaders have denied the accusations.
The opposition is demanding the resignation of Tamar Zhvania, head of the Central Election Commission, and the holding of fresh elections.
""We will fight till the end and won't allow our country to be governed by an oligarch,"" Gigi Ugulava, an opposition leader, told thousands of protesters, referring to Bidzina Ivanishvili, the ruling party head and the country's wealthiest man. 
Critics say Ivanishvili, who does not hold a government post, runs the South Caucasus country of 3.7 million people from behind the scenes, an accusation denied by Georgian Dream, which has governed for two consecutive terms.
The protest, held on the capital's main Rustaveli avenue, took place days before a planned visit by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""We will send this message to the U.S. secretary of state that elections have been rigged,"" Ugulava said.

Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, who went by the nom de guerre Abu Muhammad al-Masri, was gunned down by two men on a motorcycle in the streets of Tehran on Aug. 7, the Times reported on Friday.
The killing of Masri, who was seen as a likely successor to al Qaeda's current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was kept secret until now, the newspaper said.
A senior Afghan security source told Reuters in October that Masri, who has long been on the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Most Wanted Terrorists list, had been killed in the Pasdaran area of ​​Tehran. Reuters had been unable to corroborate that information.
It was unclear what, if any, role the United States had in the killing of the Egyptian-born militant, the Times said. U.S. authorities had been tracking Masri and other al Qaeda operatives in Iran for years, it said.
Al Qaeda has not announced his death, Iranian officials have covered it up and no government has publicly claimed responsibility, the Times said.
Iran on Saturday denied the report, saying there were no al Qaeda ""terrorists"" on its soil.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement that the United States and Israel sometimes ""try to tie Iran to such groups by lying and leaking false information to the media in order to avoid responsibility for the criminal activities of this group and other terrorist groups in the region"".
The administration of President Donald Trump's ""scare-mongering tactic against Iran has become routine,"" Khatibzadeh said. 
A U.S. official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, declined to confirm any details of the Times story or say whether there was any U.S. involvement. The White House National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Israeli prime minister's office said it was not commenting on the report.
Israel has said in the past that its intelligence services have penetrated Iran in recent years, including saying in 2018 that it had smuggled out an alleged archive of Iranian nuclear secrets.
Masri, one of al Qaeda's founding leaders, was killed along with his daughter, the Times reported. She was the widow of former al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden’s son.
Osama bin Laden orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan in 2011.
Shi'ite Iran and al Qaeda, a Sunni Muslim militant organization, have long been enemies.
Masri had been in Iran's ""custody"" since 2003 but had been living freely in an upscale suburb of Tehran since 2015, the Times cited unnamed U.S. intelligence officials as saying.
U.S. counterterrorism officials believe Iran, also a U.S. enemy, may have let him live there to conduct operations against U.S. targets, the Times said.
There was an unusual killing in Tehran on Aug. 7, the day Masri was reportedly killed, that was reported by Iranian state media at the time. State media said on Aug. 8 that a Lebanese man and his daughter had been killed in the northern Tehran neighbourhood of Pasdaran by unknown assailants on motorcycle.
They identified the man as Habib Dawoud, a 58-year-old history teacher, and his daughter Mariam, 27.
The semi-official Mehr news agency quoted a Tehran police source as saying the two were in a vehicle and were “shot four times from the driver’s side”.
The Iranian government did not confirm the incident at the time, although on Aug. 8 the official IRNA news agency reported that the public relations office of Tehran's Provincial Government had tweeted the report quoting several media, including social media accounts. 
It was not immediately known what, if any, impact Masri's death has had on al Qaeda's activities. Even as it has lost senior leaders in the nearly two decades since the attacks on New York and Washington, it has maintained active affiliates from the Middle East to Afghanistan to West Africa.
The report of al-Masri's killing comes weeks after the killing of two other senior al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan by local security forces. 

In October, Afghan security forces killed Abu Muhsin al-Masri, another person on the FBI's terrorist list, while the Afghan government this month announced that it had killed yet another senior al Qaeda commander.

As the flames took hold with the help of strips of cardboard, he used a wooden chair to smash the low-slung one-storey house's windows and bed sheets to try to spread the blaze, which soon consumed the whole house. 
""They will already be here tomorrow morning. The Azeris. Screw them. Let them live here, if they can,"" he said, as the fire got going. 
Next door, grey smoke was rising from what was left of his own house. 
Armenians are resorting to a scorched earth policy as the clock ticks down to a handover of territory to Azerbaijan under a Russia-brokered peace deal that followed six weeks of fighting between ethnic Armenian forces and Azeri troops over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas. 
Nestled in the mountains, Charektar is a small village in the Kalbajar district of Azerbaijan, which borders Nagorno-Karabakh. 
It is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but has been controlled by ethnic Armenians since a war over Nagorno-Karabakh in the 1990s. On Sunday, the Azeris will return and take back control of the area.
Arsen, 35, who declined to give his surname, said he and other ethnic Armenians had no desire to leave anything useful for the Azeris. 
""They will have to build their own houses from scratch,"" he said. 
Reuters reporters saw six houses, around half the village, on fire in Charektar on Saturday. 
One man, who refused to give his name, said Armenians were carting off everything they could as trucks nearby loaded up with household possessions. 
TEARS AND FEARS
Some residents of Armenia visited the area on Saturday to see it, possibly for the last time, and witness the village's burning. 
One Armenian woman was in tears as she watched.
Arsen said he'd learnt of the peace deal from other fighters. 
""They called me and said: Go home and take everything you have. They (the Azeris) should enter the region by the fifteenth (of November),"" he recalled.
He and his wife planned to go with their four children to Armenia and rent a flat there, he said.
Asked why he and other villagers were afraid to stay, he said they feared the Azeris would kill them.
""Have you ever seen Armenians and the Azeris living together?"" he said.

""We are leaving all the gravestones (of our relatives) here. Nightmare is not the right word for it.""

Sinas had led anti-drug operations in which thousands of people were killed.
""If he has (committed) any offence, he is pardoned already. I do not see any wrongdoing with moral implications and malice,"" Duterte said, adding that Sinas was not at fault for receiving a surprise festivity.
Sinas has been under investigation by the justice ministry for celebrating his birthday with fellow officers in May despite coronavirus curbs and at a time police were arresting thousands of people for quarantine violations. He has apologised for ""causing anxiety to the public"".
It was not immediately clear if Duterte's comments meant those investigations were no longer active. Contacted for comment by Reuters, justice minister Menardo Guevarra said in a text message: ""I did not hear what the president said exactly. I need to know the context.""

Sinas's appointment to lead the Philippines' 200,000-strong police force was met with activists' concerns of unchecked human rights abuses. Rights group say the police had summarily executed suspects, but police say those suspects had violently resisted arrest.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Two airports in Ethiopia's Amhara state which neighbours Tigray where federal troops are fighting local forces were targeted by rocket fire late on Friday, the government said, as an 11-day conflict widened.
The airport in Gondar in Amhara state, which neighbours Tigray, was hit on Friday, while another rocket aimed at the Bahir Dar airport missed the target, the government said.
The ruling Tigray party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), said the Tigray Defence Forces conducted missile strikes in military bases in Bahir Dar and Gondar in retaliation for air strikes conducted by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's forces in various parts of the state.
""As long as the attacks on the people of Tigray do not stop, the attacks will intensify,"" Getachew Reda, a spokesperson for the TPLF, said in a statement on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of the Tigray state's communications office.
Abiy sent the national defence force on an offensive against local troops in Tigray last week, after accusing them of attacking federal troops. Hundreds of people have been killed.
The prime minister has said government warplanes were bombing military targets in Tigray, including arms depots and equipment controlled by the Tigrayan forces. The government says its military operations are aimed at restoring the rule of law in the mountainous state of 5 million people. 
One of the rockets hit the airport in Gondar and partially damaged it, said Awoke Worku, spokesperson for Gondar central zone, while a second missile fired simultaneously landed just outside of the airport at Bahir Dar.
""The TPLF junta is utilising the last of the weaponry within its arsenals,"" the Ethiopian government's emergency task force wrote on Twitter.
The Amhara regional state's forces have been fighting alongside their federal counterparts against Tigray's fighters.
Yohannes Ayele, a resident of Gondar, said he heard a loud explosion in the Azezo neighbourhood of the city at 10:30 p.m..
Another resident of the area said the rocket had damaged the airport terminal building. The area was sealed off and firefighting vehicles were parked outside, the resident added.
An Ethiopian Airlines worker who did not wish to be identified said flights to both Gondar and Bahir Dar airports had been cancelled after the attacks.
The United Nations, the African Union and others are concerned that the fighting could spread to other parts of Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country, and destabilise the wider Horn of Africa region.
More than 14,500 people have fled into neighbouring Sudan, with the speed of new arrivals ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday. 
Ethiopia's Human Rights Commission, appointed by the government but independent, said it was sending a team of investigators to the town of Mai Kadra in Tigray, where Amnesty International this week reported what it said was evidence of mass killings.
Amnesty International said on Thursday scores and possibly hundreds of civilians were stabbed and hacked to death in the region on Nov. 9, citing witnesses. It said it had not been able to independently confirm who was responsible, but said the witnesses had blamed fighters loyal to Tigray's local leaders.
The Tigray state government denied involvement in the reported killings.
""TPLF absolutely refutes allegations the TPLF members and the Tigray special police force were involved in this most tragic event,"" it said in a statement.

The rights commission said in a statement it would investigate all allegations of human rights violations in the conflict.

Ibrahim told al Jadid he went on a two day visit to Damascus and was in regular contact with Tice's mother to tell her that he would continue to work on her son's ""file"". 
""I won't stop working on this subject and I promised Tice's mother whom I met in Washington and am in daily touch with on the phone,"" he told the broadcaster.
U.S. President Donald Trump has adopted the case of the freelance journalist and former U.S. Marine officer who disappeared while reporting in Syria in 2012.
Abbas said the trip to Damascus came after he visited Washington last month where he met with national security adviser Robert O’Brien.
A Trump administration official on Oct.18 confirmed a newspaper report that a White House official travelled to Damascus earlier this year for secret meetings with the Syrian government seeking the release of Tice and another U.S. citizen.
The trip was the first time such a high-level U.S. official had met in Syria with the isolated government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in more than a decade.

Syria erupted into civil war nearly a decade ago after Assad in 2011 began a brutal crackdown on protesters calling for an end to his family’s rule.

HANOI/MANILA (Reuters) - Vietnam was bracing for Typhoon Vamco to make landfall in the country's central coast early on Sunday, as the death toll in the Philippines rose to 53 from that country's deadliest storm this year.
Packing winds of up to 165 kph (103 mph), Vamco is forecast to hit a swathe of Vietnam's coast from Ha Tinh to Quang Ngai province, the government's weather agency said on Saturday.
""This is a very strong typhoon,"" Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said, warning provinces in Vamco's projected path to prepare for its impact. 
The provinces plan to evacuate 468,000 people by the end of Saturday, state media cited the government's disaster management authority as saying.
Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline. Vamco will be the 13th storm that affects the Southeast Asian country this year, where more than 160 people have been killed in natural disasters triggered by a series of storms since early October. 
""There has been no respite for more than eight million people living in central Vietnam,"" said Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, Vietnam Red Cross Society President. ""Each time they start rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, they are pummelled by yet another storm.""
In the Philippines, coast guard and disaster agencies scrambled on Saturday to rescue thousands in a northern province after the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines this year tore through the main island of Luzon late on Wednesday and early Thursday.

Vamco has killed at least 53 people, injured 52 and left 22 missing in the Philippines, according to the Philippines police and army.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Police on Friday evacuated a building housing French video game maker  Ubisoft 's (PA:UBIP) Montreal offices after receiving a hostage call which turned out to be a hoax.
The drama unfolded on Friday afternoon when police officers in combat gear, and armored vehicles and ambulances, surrounded the red brick building in the Mile End neighborhood north of downtown.
""The perimeter was quickly secured and ... no threat has been detected and no injuries are reported,"" the police said in a statement, adding that it will investigate the call which resulted in ""important"" force deployment. 
Officers were sent to the location after a 911 emergency call, the police said earlier. 
The center of the police operation was the building that houses Ubisoft's Montreal offices, among other companies.
All Ubisoft Montreal staff are safe and have been evacuated, Ubisoft spokeswoman Heather Steele said.
Aerial footage taken by the Quebec French-news chain LCN showed people gathered on the rooftop terrace of the building, along with heavy objects left at the door to block it.
An Ubisoft employee, Eric Pope, tweeted a screen grab from LCN's footage of people gathered on a rooftop.
""This is insane. This is my team on the roof,"" Pope wrote in the tweet. According to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, he is a senior community developer at Ubisoft Montreal. Pope did not respond to a request for comment.

Another Ubisoft employee told CTV News station in Canada that employees at the office were instructed via a company memo to hide in an area that locks and to keep quiet.

The Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that recreational marijuana should be permitted, and lawmakers in 2017 legalized the use of medicinal marijuana. But the country has yet to pass laws that would legalize its recreational use, or regulations for medicinal marijuana. 
Lawmakers are now rushing to try to meet a Dec. 15 deadline set by the Supreme Court for legalization, with the support of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who has aimed to removing the drug as a source of income for violent drug gangs.
Discussed by the Senate's health, justice, and legislative studies commissions on Friday, the marijuana bill would allow licensed sale of pot, let users carry up to 28 grams of the drug and grow as many as four cannabis plants in their homes.
It would also create the Mexican Institute for Regulation and Cannabis Control within the Health Ministry. 
Among the restrictions, children and teenagers would be prohibited from smoking pot or being at all involved in its cultivation and sale, and the drug would not be allowed while driving. 
The possible legalization of hemp, a product derived from marijuana, for industrial use in sectors such as construction or food production, has not yet been hammered out, a legislative staffer told Reuters. 
However, the bill does propose allowing the sale, import and export of non-psychoactive cannabis products for industrial use.
Major companies are positioning themselves for a time when Mexico opens up what would be the world's biggest legal cannabis market in terms of population, where the drug can be lawfully cultivated and sold. 

Pro-marijuana activists have called for the passage of the bill in recent weeks with a cannabis ""garden"" next to the Senate, where police have turned a blind eye to recreational users freely lighting up joints.

Iota formed on Friday afternoon, and the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it could be blowing winds of up to 120 miles per hour (193 kph) when it collides with Central America, two weeks after Eta battered the area.
""Flooding and landslides from heavy rainfall could be significant across Central America given recovery efforts under way after Hurricane Eta,"" the NHC said.
Eta sparked floods and mudslides that killed scores of people across a huge swathe of terrain stretching from Panama to southern Mexico.
No area was harder hit than the central Guatemalan region of Alta Verapaz, where a mountain partly collapsed onto the village of Queja, killing and burying alive dozens of residents.
At 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) Iota was about 335 miles (539 km) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica packing maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (64 kph) It was moving at a slow 3 mph (5 kph) in a west-southwest direction.
Dangerous winds, rising sea levels and downpours could menace the coast of Nicaragua and Honduras from Sunday night, the Miami-based NHC said.
The center expected to issue hurricane watches for portions of those areas by late Friday or early Saturday.
Through Wednesday morning, Iota could spark life-threatening flash flooding and cause rivers to burst their banks in parts of Haiti, Jamaica and Central America, the NHC said.
In Honduras, evacuations were already under way in Sula Valley, and officials said they would on Saturday start letting water out of a major dam in anticipation of Iota, the record-breaking 30th storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.

With England under lockdown until December, care home visits can still go ahead in certain circumstances, but official guidance states that screens, windows or ""visiting pods"" should be used to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
""I know how heart-breaking restricting visits to care homes has been, not only for residents, many of whom will feel disoriented and confused by the situation, but also their loved ones who aren't able to simply hug each other to support them in this difficult time,"" health minister Matt Hancock said.
""Thanks to the expanding testing capacity we have in place we can now begin to trial a new way to allow safer visits to take place and prevent the spread of COVID-19."" 
During the first wave of the pandemic, the government was criticised for failing to stop a deadly spread of the coronavirus through care homes, and for releasing people from hospital into care homes without testing them first.
The pilot, which starts on Monday, will happen in around 20 care homes across southern England, in areas where COVID-19 rates are lower, with a view to rolling out the scheme more widely in December. 
Regular testing will be available to one family member or friend per resident, and, with other measures, such as using protective equipment, could remove the need for screens when having indoor visits.

Care home visitors can either use gold-standard PCR tests, which they can do at home, or lateral flow tests, which are less accurate but give results in just 30 minutes and can be done at the care homes themselves.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The former president of a private tennis academy in Texas was sentenced on Friday to three months in prison after admitting he acted as a middleman to pay bribes to help the children of wealthy parents gain admission to selective universities.
Federal prosecutors in Boston had sought six months in prison for Martin Fox for helping pay bribes to university coaches to designate children as fake athletic recruits and to a college entrance exam administrator to facilitate cheating.
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani called it an ""offense of greed that the defendant really had no reason to be doing."" But given recent health issues Fox has faced, she imposed a shorter prison term to be followed by three months in home confinement. 
Fox, who pleaded guilty last year to racketeering conspiracy, must also pay a $95,000 fine and forfeit $245,000 that he earned through the scheme, whose mastermind paid him to facilitate bribes.
""I'm ashamed of what I've done,"" Fox, 63, said during a virtual court hearing on Friday. ""My parents raised me better than this.""
Fifty-eight people have been charged in the scandal, in which prosecutors said parents conspired with California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to secure their children's college admissions fraudulently.

The parents include ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman, who received a 14-day prison sentence, and ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin, who was sentenced to two months in prison. Singer pleaded guilty in March 2019.
Prosecutors said that from 2015 to 2017, Fox acted as a middleman for Singer to pay bribes to coaches at the University of Texas and University of San Diego in exchange for designating three children as athletic recruits.
They said Fox also funneled bribes to a college entrance exam administrator in Houston to facilitate cheating on ACT and SAT exams by four children of Singer's clients.

President-elect Biden solidified his victory over Republican President Donald Trump on Friday after the U.S. state of Georgia went his way, leaving Trump little hope of reversing the outcome through legal challenges and recounts.
""This election process in the U.S. is not over yet,"" Duda was quoted as saying by the niezalezna.pl website. 
""All the indications are that Joe Biden will be the president, but this issue is not yet finally settled,"" the Polish president was quoted as saying during a video conference for readers of right-wing newspaper Gazeta Polska.
Biden's election as the next American president puts Warsaw in a potentially awkward position after it had set great store in its relationship with Trump while straining links with European Union allies over democratic values.
During the election campaign, Biden accused Trump of backing authoritarian leaders around the world, referring to Poland among others.
According to niezalezna.pl, Duda said he did not believe a new face in the White House would mean any serious problems for Poland, but he may have different views than Biden on some ideological issues, as the Democrats were a ""liberal-left"" party.

""For years, Poland has been ruled by the conservative option and there is a big difference in many ideological views, and you have to take into account that there will be ideological-political disputes resuting from this,"" he was quoted as saying.

The talks in Tunis this week follow a ceasefire agreed last month between the two major sides in the country's war - the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA). 

However, many Libyans remain sceptical that the peacemaking efforts will end nearly a decade of chaos and bloodshed following the 2011 NATO-backed uprising against Muammar Gaddafi.

The discovery of the photos on the phone of 21-year-old Tunisian Brahim al-Aouissaoui, who was shot and wounded by police in the Oct. 29 attack, could indicate a common motive behind the two attacks.
Anti-terrorist prosecutors said in a media statement that an examination of Aouissaoui's mobile phone had also revealed images linked to the Islamic State group. The prosecutors did not say what they were or how they were linked to the group.
The middle school teacher, Samuel Paty, was killed by a young man of Chechen origin who, before the attack, recorded a message saying he wanted to punish Paty for showing pupils caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics class.
The attacker, partially identified by prosecutors as Abdoulakh A., was shot dead.
It was the latest in a litany of violence spanning several years in France linked to the cartoons. Muslims see them as blasphemous, while French officials have defended the right to publish them, saying it is a matter of freedom of expression.
Until now, the only connection prosecutors had drawn between the Paris attack and the Nice church attack was the method employed. In both cases, the attackers used a large knife and beheaded, or tried to behead, their victims.
The knife attack in Nice prompted the government to raise the security alert for all French territory to its highest level and President Emmanuel Macron said more soldiers would be deployed to protect key sites such as places of worship and schools. [nL8N2HL3BW]

799,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>",UK PM Johnson's Brexit 'brain' Cummings to leave Downing Street,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Dominic Cummings, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most powerful adviser, will stop working for Downing Street in mid-December as Johnson tries to reset his premiership after a series of failures in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.
Cummings, expected to stay until around Christmas, was pictured by a Reuters photographer clutching a box as he left Johnson's office in No. 10 Downing Street on Friday evening.
The BBC, Sky News and other media outlets reported that Cummings had left his role for good, abruptly reducing the sway of Brexit hardliners in Johnson's government.
But No. 10 said Cummings would continue to work for Johnson until mid-December, although it was unclear in what capacity and whether he would return to the building.
Johnson is grappling with factional fighting over the future direction of the government just as he struggles to contain Europe's deadliest COVID-19 outbreak, establish a rapport with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden and master the delicate diplomacy of a last-minute Brexit trade agreement.
Cummings, who masterminded the 2016 Brexit referendum vote and Johnson's 2019 landslide election win, had told the BBC that he wanted to be largely redundant by the end of this year, once Britain has left informal membership of the European Union.
Critics said that while the upheaval in Downing Street was unwelcome at a time of national crisis, the announcement marked the end of Cummings' policy clout.
""I think that Dom now, so far as Westminster is concerned, is a busted flush,"" said one Conservative lawmaker who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Johnson is under pressure from Conservative parliamentarians to recast his administration and get a grip of the pandemic which is decimating the economy.
JOHNSON'S 'BRAIN'
The exit of Johnson's influential right-hand man marks one of the most significant changes to the prime minister's inner circle so far: Cummings was cast by some as Johnson's ""brain"".
A committed Brexiteer, he was seen by European diplomats as a hardline influence on Johnson over Brexit and the proponent of Madman Theory - a reference to former U.S. president Richard Nixon's attempt to contain the Soviet Union during the Cold War by convincing Moscow that he was irrational.
Cummings, 48, educated at Oxford and married to the daughter of a baronet, scorned the British political establishment and hurled barbs at reporters and cabinet ministers alike.
He was cast in the Spitting Image satirical puppet show as an alien who repeatedly threatened Johnson with resignation.
With Johnson pondering decisions on future relations with the EU and the COVID-stricken economy that could impact British prosperity for a generation, the 56-year-old leader appeared trapped between rival factions.
The battle spilled into the open with the resignation of his director of communications, Lee Cain, a close Cummings ally who had been tipped as a new chief of staff.
The Westminster political bubble was awash with speculation that Johnson's fiancee Carrie Symonds aligned with Johnson's new press secretary Allegra Stratton to oust Cain - to the displeasure of Cummings, who then threatened to resign.
Cain will also keep working for Johnson until mid-December.
'TAKE BACK CONTROL'
Cummings's strategy was instrumental in driving Vote Leave to victory in the 2016 Brexit referendum. He is credited with coining the campaign's central slogan: ""Take back control"".
Cummings believes the elites of the West - and the United Kingdom in particular - are out of touch with voters and have repeatedly neglected the interests of their people while bailing out big business.
In 2019, he told Reuters to stop asking about Brexit: ""You guys should get outside London and go to talk to people who are not rich Remainers.""
His disregard for accepted norms was shown when he said he had done nothing wrong by driving 250 miles from London to obtain childcare at a time when Britons were in lockdown to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
Cummings is seen by allies and enemies as a ruthless strategist who cares little for the conventions of traditional British politics. Known as Dom to his friends - who regard him as a visionary - he was described by former Prime Minister David Cameron as a ""career psychopath"".
Asked once if he was the Thomas Cromwell of British politics - a reference to King Henry VIII's most feared adviser - Cummings chuckled.
He scorns the accepted Westminster dress code of a suit and tie, wearing jeans and T-shirts in Downing Street.
Cummings helped Johnson navigate the tortuous follow-through from the 2016 Brexit referendum amid a hung parliament that failed repeatedly to ratify the terms of withdrawal from the EU, and steer his quest for the prime ministership.

That set the scene for Johnson's victory in the 2019 election with the biggest majority his party has achieved since Margaret Thatcher's in 1987.

LIMA (Reuters) - Fierce clashes in Peru between police and protesters have wounded at least 11 people, doctors and rights groups said on Friday, as thousands of Peruvians took to the streets to protest the ouster of President Martin Vizcarra. 
The clashes over the last four nights, and other more peaceful protests in the capital Lima and other cities, are piling pressure on a fragmented Congress and the new government of President Manuel Merino.
On Thursday night, police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters, some of whom threw rocks at police and destroyed store windows and cash machines. The demonstrations were among the largest in two decades in Peru.
Vizcarra, a politically unaffiliated centrist who is popular with voters, was ousted on Monday in an impeachment trial over allegations he received bribes, accusations he denies. 
Merino, a member of the center-right Popular Action party who had been the head of Congress, swore in his new cabinet on Thursday and called for calm.
Peru's National Human Rights Coordinator said there were journalists among the 11 wounded on Thursday. A Lima hospital said at least two people had been injured by rubber bullets.
""All of Peru is fired up, we're all very angry,"" said Jose Vega, a protester in Lima, where some carried banners comparing Merino to the coronavirus pandemic and saying he did not represent them.
""They treat us poorly. We've only come to protest against injustice... We are all feeling pain. So, I'm saying to everyone let's not give up.""
Vizcarra oversaw an anti-graft campaign that led to frequent clashes with Congress in a country that has a history of political upheaval and corruption. 
The crisis precipitated by his departure has rattled the world's no. 2 copper producer and seen its sol currency scraping record lows. It fell again on Friday and the central bank said it would keep intervening to help stabilize the currency.
International human rights groups have expressed concern about the use of force by police against protesters and the Organization of American States has called for Peru's Constitutional Court to give clarity on the constitutionality of the impeachment process.
""We're in the streets spontaneously and peacefully defending Peruvian democracy from an abuse by Congress,"" said Gino Costa, a lawmaker from the progressive Morado Party who joined Thursday's protests.

M'BATTO, Ivory Coast (Reuters) - Before last month's presidential election, M'Batto in central Ivory Coast was a small, peaceful town where ethnic groups intermarried and churches and mosques existed side by side without friction, residents say.
Two weeks on and the streets are littered with empty shotgun cartridges, shops have been burned down and at least six people are dead, killed in ethnic clashes that some fear could herald a repeat of Ivory Coast's civil wars in 2002 and 2010-2011. 
The Oct. 31 election, which was boycotted by the opposition, opened up old wounds around the question of identity in Ivory Coast between mostly northern Dioula migrants and the Agni southerners who see themselves as original settlers.
The landslide win of President Alassane Ouattara for a controversial third term made tensions worse.
""I was at home when someone called me to say youths were burning our mosque. We went running to protect it,"" said Amidou Togo. In the melee that followed, someone fired a shotgun at Togo, leaving a gash in his neck.
The violence presents Ouattara with a post-election conundrum: how to stand firm against rivals who say his third term breaks the law, while reuniting a divided nation. 
The challenge was plain to see in M'Batto this week, where shop owners tried to clean up their gutted properties in the rain while soldiers with rifles patrolled nearby.
The violence began on Monday when supporters of opposition leader Pascal Affi N’Guessan, of Agni ethnicity, marched to oppose the vote. The town's migrant ethnic Dioula, who generally favour Ouattara, blocked them coming into their district. Gunshots rang out, residents said. 
One woman named Mariette Koua lost her son in the fighting and her business was burned down. She lay in a hospital bed on Thursday, too traumatised to speak. 
An acquaintance, Sidonie Nguessan Marie, sat beside her in tears. 

""They ... burned down my restaurant. They burned down everything. We have nothing left now and right now we don't know what to do, everything is gone, burned.""

Witnesses said Roman Bondarenko was detained after scuffling with people in plain clothes who had come to a playground to remove red-and-white ribbons representing a months-long protest movement against President Alexander Lukashenko.
The interior ministry denied responsibility for Bondarenko's death, saying he had been killed in a scuffle with civilians. 
The state Investigative Committee alleged Bondarenko had been drunk. Local media reports contradicted this, citing the official medical report into his death that they said showed he had no alcohol in his bloodstream. 
The death on Thursday was the latest flashpoint in months of mass protests against Lukashenko following a disputed presidential election in August. The opposition says Lukashenko rigged the vote to secure a sixth successive term.
Lukashenko denies electoral fraud and, buoyed by support from traditional ally Russia, has rejected opposition calls to resign or hold new elections. 
However, having previously promised to stay the course for a full term, on Friday he said he would announce the terms and conditions for his resignation at a special assembly next year.
""I will just leave this post when I need to,"" he said in televised comments. ""Under no circumstances will we go abandon people and leave. I'm not going to run anywhere."" 
He offered his condolences to Bondarenko's family. 
""We need to investigate everything honestly and objectively,"" said Lukashenko, a 66-year-old former Soviet collective farm manager who came to power in 1994. 
A violent crackdown after the election prompted a new round of Western sanctions on Minsk. 
The European Union in a statement from its foreign policy department called Bondarenko's death ""an outrageous and shameful result of the actions by the Belarusian authorities"" who had ""directly and violently carried out repression of their own population"". 
The bloc, which has blacklisted some Belarusian officials, threatened further sanctions.
Rupert Colville, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called for a ""thorough, transparent and independent investigation"". 
HOMAGE TO PROTESTER
Videos posted by Belarusian media on Friday showed people standing along roads, near universities, factories and hospitals with red-and-white flags in their hands and portraits of Bondarenko.
In a video from the courtyard where Bondarenko was detained, hundreds of people stood in a minute of silence and then chanted: ""We will not forget, we will not forgive."" Large piles of flowers were laid at the site. 
""It's impossible to bear, what they did. Everybody is crying here,"" said a participant in one of the human solidarity chains in Minsk. 
Hundreds gathered near the Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Name of Mary in Minsk, where a service was held for Bondarenko. 
The news outlet Nasha Niva reported that police had detained protesters in at least four towns.
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main opponent, who fled into exile in Lithuania after the election, announced the creation of a ""People's Tribunal"" and an amnesty for anyone who managed to capture Lukashenko or his associates. 

""Our country has finally turned into a crime scene. I declare that Alexander Lukashenko and his accomplices are a terrorist organisation that must answer for their crimes,"" she said in a statement.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine will propose sending 1,500 police officers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to patrol the conflict zone in the east of the country in a new peace initiative, two sources told Reuters on Friday. 
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's administration also wants an international audit of property its citizens lost as a result of the conflict, and a repeal of a Russian move in 2019 that fast-tracked citizenship procedures for people living in the Donbass region. 
Ukraine has been battling Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass in a conflict that erupted in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and killed more than 13,000 people. 
Zelenskiy made ending the conflict a priority after taking office in 2019. A ceasefire agreement in 2015 staunched the worst of the fighting but international OSCE monitors still record ceasefire violations. 
Ukraine will push for the Donbass region to be demilitarised as a precursor to holding elections there.
""For this, it is proposed to create a special unit of up to 1,500 professional policemen within the OSCE SMM [Special Monitoring Mission],"" one of the sources said. 
The OSCE could not be reached for immediate comment. The OSCE has previously considered sending armed monitors or police to Donbass, but only if there was consensus on all sides. 
Zelenskiy wants to push for a lasting peace settlement at a new round of four-way talks with Russia, France and Germany, but no date has been fixed for such a meeting. The last round happened in Paris last December. 
Ukraine says Russia engineered quasi-separatist uprisings across a belt of eastern Ukraine in 2014 that escalated into a full-scale war. Moscow denies the accusation.

The unusually blunt comments directed at close U.S. allies came from Marc Knapper, deputy assistant secretary for Korea and Japan, as Tokyo and Seoul were set to join 13 other Asia Pacific economies this weekend in signing a China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which could become the world's largest free trade agreement.
Knapper also stressed the importance of South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries working with the United States and each other to ensure their citizens' data was protected from China.
Speaking from Seoul at an online event hosted by the Brookings Institution think tank, Knapper said Washington understood Japan and South Korea had ""very complex and nuanced relationships"" with China.
""Regardless of the fact that there are very important trading relationships and others ... we all should be able to stand up and speak out when we see bad behavior from China.""
Knapper said Washington was not asking Japan and Korea to ""cut off or contain"" China, but added: ""We hope and expect that Korea and Japan and others will stand up and speak out on behalf of these things.
""It's the responsibility of countries like the United States, countries like South Korea, countries like Japan, to accept the responsibility of speaking out on behalf of democracy, speaking out on behalf of freedom, because if we don't, who will?""
A U.S.-China trade war and U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" retreat from predecessor Barack Obama's ""pivot"" toward Asia have given impetus to complete the RCEP, which is widely seen as Beijing's chance to set a regional trade agenda.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Spain to tighten security around Canary Islands after rush of migrants,"GRAN CANARIA, Spain (Reuters) - Spain will expand naval patrols around the Canary Islands and set up more migrant centres in response to a surge of arrivals from Africa, including more than 2,000 people last weekend, the regional policy minister said on Friday.
Security forces will add at least three ocean-going vessels, a plane, a helicopter and a submarine to the existing fleet policing the waters between Africa's west coast and the Spanish archipelago, Carolina Darias told a news conference in Gran Canaria.
Almost 16,000 people have reached the Canary Islands after braving the Atlantic in the dangerous crossing from Africa this year - more than 10 times last year's total - including 2,213 last weekend.
""The main objective of this government, and of any government, is to avoid anybody risking their life getting aboard one of these boats,"" Darias said.
Deepening economic hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic is pushing more people to seek better lives elsewhere, but tighter security on the Mediterranean means more migrants are attempting the Atlantic crossing, with many perishing along the way.
Some 140 people died en route after their boat caught fire and capsized off the coast of Senegal last month. 
In parallel, Madrid will increase diplomatic efforts across West Africa and particularly in Morocco, the departure point for most of the Europe-bound boats, to curb the number of departures. 
With reception centres across the islands stretched to capacity, nearly 2,000 people have been stranded at Gran Canaria's Arguineguin port in conditions that an immigration judge described on Thursday as ""inhumane and degrading.""
""You can't stack 1,980 people in 400 squared meters, firstly because they are not cattle, secondly they are human beings and in third place because there are no sanitary conditions to treat them properly,"" said Arcadio Diaz Tejera, who ensures that migrants interned at the Las Palmas immigration centre receive proper legal representation.
Minister Darias said local authorities were already working to clear the dockside, while a camp set up at a former military warehouse would soon be able to house up to 800 people. 
Several other military sites will soon be converted into migrant centres, she added, without saying how many people they would be able to accommodate.

Matt Ratana, a 54-year-old custody sergeant who was originally from New Zealand, was shot dead inside a police station in south London. The 23-year-old suspect is then believed to have turned the gun on himself.
""The man's condition, originally critical, has since stabilised and is no longer considered life-threatening. Therefore, on Friday, 13 November he was considered fit to be arrested on suspicion of murder,"" police said in a statement.
They said the suspect, whom they did not name, remained in hospital and that officers would work with medical and legal experts to determine when he would be fit for interview.
An inquest has heard that Ratana was killed after the suspect, despite being handcuffed behind his back after being arrested, managed to produce a revolver and shot him several times.

The inquest has been adjourned while the police carry out their murder inquiry. Police are not treating the murder as terrorism.

Russia is deploying almost 2,000 troops along with tanks and other armour to secure a truce agreed this week after a six-week war over the ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan and surrounding areas in which Turkey-backed Azeri forces captured swathes of territory.
The scale of the destruction on Friday showed how desperate the fighting had become.
One Russian column, accompanied by Reuters reporters from the Armenian border, drove past around a hundred dead ethnic Armenian soldiers strewn by the roadside.
One soldier lay prostrate in the middle of the road as the convoy laboured up a hill. 
Cars, pierced with shrapnel, and vans littered the roadside as well as a burnt out tank and other damaged military vehicles. Several bodies were slumped in what looked like a bullet-riddled military ambulance. One of the dead men's legs was bandaged up, another dead man had a tourniquet.
Several roadside gravestones were damaged, and some of the bullet-riddled vehicles bore graffiti, including Swastikas and a reference to a bloody Soviet-era outbreak of ethnic violence against Armenians in then the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.
It was not clear who had left the graffiti.
In Lachin, closer to Armenia, a group of ethnic Armenian men who said they had fought for Nagorno-Karabakh defence forces raised their hands to greet the passing Russian convoy, but said they were not happy with the peace deal.
One of them, Suren Zarakyan, 50, said he had moved to the Lachin region from Yerevan, the Armenian capital, in the 1990s after Armenians took the territory in the first war over Nagorno-Karabakh. 
Married with two children, he said he had raised honey bees before the war but was not sure now whether the hives were on territory which under the terms of the peace deal would now be handed to Azerbaijan.
He said he felt shame when he heard about the truce agreement, which froze the Azeri territorial gains and paved the way for Moscow's deployment of troops in the enclave.
""I expected more from Russia and sooner,"" he said. ""But Russia is interested in its bases and goals. It does not matter if it’s a base in Azerbaijan or in Armenia. It is interested in not letting the Turks here.""
He said he did not want to live side by side with Azeris, but that Azeri forces, with Turkey's help, had been stronger and drones had played a crucial role.
""They did 90% of the work,"" he lamented. An abandoned truck-mounted multiple rocket launcher system sat nearby. 
""We were lying low and did not see anyone. But we were bombed, bombed, and bombed. In the night, in the morning, and during the day"".
More than 4,000 people were killed on both sides, including civilians, with 8,000 wounded and tens of thousands driven from their homes, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.

Near the town of Kalbajar, on a different road, ethnic Armenians could be seen leaving. Trucks full of household possessions jostled with heavily-laden cars and trucks to make their way to Armenia.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The United States should quickly back its words with actions if, as expected, it rejoins the Paris accord on combating global warming, India's environment minister said on Friday. 
President Donald Trump has questioned climate science and withdrew the United States from the 2015 accord, which it formally exited this month.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the pact and invest $2 trillion to wean his country off planet-warming fossil fuels.
""(The) U.S. is welcome but should fulfil its responsibility,"" Prakash Javadekar, minister for environment, forest and climate change, told Reuters in response to whether the Paris talks and processes would get fresh momentum with a new U.S. administration in place.
""We want all countries to join but ... they should ... not bring in new issues into the discourse. We want action to start immediately.""
Meeting the Paris Agreement's target of capping warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius should be a top priority, Javadekar said.
India, the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases and just behind China on its consumption of coal, has yet to commit to pursuing net-zero emissions.
Struggling with some of the worst pollution on earth, India has pledged to increase the share of renewable energy to 40% of installed coal capacity by 2030, from 23.3% now.
Last month, Trump described India as ""filthy"".
That prompted Biden - whose Vice President Kamala Harris is half-Indian - to tweet: ""It's not how you talk about friends — and it's not how you solve global challenges like climate change.""
Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a record high this year, according to a United Nations report in September, despite the economic slowdown linked to the coronavirus pandemic.

SRINAGAR, India/MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) - At least 10 civilians and four security personnel were killed in cross-border shelling between India and Pakistan on Friday, in one of this year's deadliest days along the heavily militarised frontier separating the nuclear-armed rivals, officials said.
The barrage of mortars and other weapons along several parts of the Line of Control - the de-facto border - began after Indian troops foiled an infiltration attempt from Pakistan in northern Kashmir, officials in Srinagar and New Delhi said.
Pakistan's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Indian officials said six civilians, three soldiers and a border guard were killed on their side. Officials on the Pakistani side said four civilians were killed there. Indian officials said they believed there were also casualties among Pakistani security forces.
Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full. Each rules part of the region, with New Delhi long accusing its neighbour of fueling an insurgency, which Pakistan denies.
Indian and Pakistani troops regularly exchange fire across the mountainous border, but the shelling on Friday was particularly intense, according to Indian officials. Both sides also accused the other of firing at civilian areas.
""As usual they targeted civilian populations without any remorse,"" said Syed Shahid Qadri, a government official in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, where a woman was among the dead and 27 others were injured.
Across the border in Indian Kashmir, officials said an 8-year-old child was among those killed in the shelling that started in the morning and continued late into the evening.
Mukhtar Ahmad, a resident of Uri in Indian Kashmir said there was panic in the hillside town after loud explosions were heard from areas closer to the de facto border.
""Several families have fled the area and taken shelter in Uri town,"" he said.
More than 40 civilians have been killed in firing between Indian and Pakistani troops this year, according to official data, with both sides suffering similar fatalities.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Political upheaval offers Erdogan chance to heal party wounds,"By Orhan Coskun
ANKARA (Reuters) - Political turmoil over the resignation of Turkey's once powerful finance minister has a silver lining for President Tayyip Erdogan, offering a chance to ease tensions in his ruling party over the influential and divisive figure.
Berat Albayrak, Erdogan's son-in-law, said he was stepping down on Sunday in a dramatic statement on Instagram. The abrupt departure of a central figure in Erdogan's inner circle stunned the government and undermined the president who had long championed him, officials said. 
But it also presents an opportunity to win back disaffected members within the ruling AK Party who felt marginalised by the rapid rise of the 42-year-old former businessman and took issue with his stewardship of the troubled economy, party sources say.
Disenchanted party members, including some parliamentarians, had been considering leaving and joining one of two new breakaway parties set up by AKP founders and former allies of Erdogan, according to three officials who spoke to Reuters.
""Such a thing was happening for the first time under Erdogan's leadership,"" an official close to the party said, referring to the 17 years that Erdogan has dominated Turkish politics since he became prime minister in 2003. 
Polls have also shown support for the AKP, which relies on an alliance with a smaller nationalist party for its parliamentary majority, suffering as the country battles the COVID-19 pandemic, high inflation and a tumbling lira.
This week's events mean it ""will be possible to win back those who are resentful or who started to lose hope,"" the official said, referring to Albayrak's resignation.
Opposition parties said this week that Albayrak's resignation revealed a ""state crisis"", and that reshuffling ministers would not be enough to rescue the economy. 
NEW STRATEGY
In parliament this week Erdogan promised an economic growth strategy based on stability, lower inflation and international investment, a marked shift in tone from the president who has frequently blamed foreigners for Turkey's economic problems.
That followed a series of talks he held last week with officials and bankers about the Turkish lira's tumble to record lows against the dollar despite $100 billion spent this year to curb its fall.
In particular, executives at state banks pressed Erdogan to look into the depleted foreign exchange reserves, which he did, according to a former banker familiar with the matter.
After markets closed last week, Erdogan sacked the Central Bank governor, replacing him with a former finance minister who is expected to follow more orthodox monetary policy to address the slide in the lira.
Another senior official close to the AK Party said the shift of tone at home may be mirrored by less confrontational policy abroad, as Turkey adapts to an expected shift in Washington toward a firmer line toward Ankara, for example on its purchase of Russian air defences, when President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January.

""There were serious criticisms regarding some of Albayrak's policies and the president's positioning of him,"" another senior official close to the AK Party said. ""Now a new beginning is being carried out.""

815,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>","U.S. election turmoil heightens Afghan uncertainty, but hopefully no more 'fate by Tweet'","KABUL (Reuters) - The change in the U.S. administration is expected eventually to bring a steadier troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, officials and analysts said, but the disputed presidential election has heightened uncertainty and could deepen delays in peace talks. 
A senior Afghan government official said he was relieved that under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, the process would likely be clearer and less chaotic. 
""A Tweet won't decide the fate of American troops in Afghanistan,"" he said.
Taliban militants, fighting to oust the U.S.-backed government in Kabul, this week called on the United States to stick to a February agreement with the Trump administration to withdraw U.S. troops by May, subject to certain security guarantees.
Afghan officials hope some troops will stay beyond May.
Afghan government negotiator Fawzia Koofi agreed the U.S. election, disputed by President Donald Trump, was likely to slow the peace process, but added Biden's win had given hope that the withdrawal timeline would be based on on-the-ground realities.
""We understand that people close to Joe Biden have a different view about the troop withdrawal,"" Koofi told Reuters. ""So that will probably give the Afghan government some time to prepare itself because we have been saying an irresponsible withdrawal will (probably) result in the collapse ... of institutions.""
In October, Trump posted a surprise Tweet calling for troops to be home by Christmas, a move welcomed by the Taliban, the same day his national security adviser said troops would number around 2,500 at the start of 2021.
U.S. officials are now watching the remaining weeks of Trump's tenure to see if he makes good on his campaign promise to end the United States' ""ridiculous endless wars"".
NO NEW GUIDANCE
Ashley Jackson, Co-Director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the Overseas Development Institute, said the ""real issue"" was the possibility of delays to the peace process.
""While they deal with other urgent priorities, the Afghan peace process hangs in the balance,"" she told Reuters. ""Without a strong signal about where this is going from the White House, both sides will continue to hedge their bets ... that could derail the process before its even made much progress.""
Violence has already been rising throughout Afghanistan with the Taliban attacking provincial capitals, in some case prompting U.S. airstrikes, as talks in Qatar's capital have been dragged out.
Biden's team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Biden said in a foreign policy address included on his website he would bring ""the vast majority of our troops home from Afghanistan and narrowly focus our mission on Al-Qaeda and ISIS"".
One U.S. official said there had been no new guidance to the Pentagon or State Department on Afghanistan in recent days and it was unclear when senior officials would meet Trump for an update. 
In recent weeks, officials have warned that violence in Afghanistan remains too high and a precipitous withdrawal would be dangerous. The United Nations has also said that the Taliban still has ties with al Qaeda.
""We are somewhat concerned about the peace process as president-elect Joe Biden might bring some changes in the U.S. team for Afghanistan but we don't expect they would scrap the whole process,"" one Taliban leader in Doha told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

""We still have the option of war if the new U.S. administration betrays us.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Twenty migrants are thought to have drowned off the coast of Libya in a shipwreck this week, the United Nations migration agency said on Friday, as bodies from an earlier accident continued to wash ashore.
The second shipwreck, a wooden boat that left from the coastal town of Surman, west of the capital Tripoli, brings the total from the two incidents to at least 94, a spokeswoman for the International Organization for Migration said. 
The earlier accident involved a rubber dinghy that left from the town of Khums and capsized on Thursday.

""The worsening humanitarian conditions of migrants detained in overcrowded centres, widespread arbitrary arrests and imprisonment, and extortion and abuse are alarming,"" she said.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine has said Iran is dragging its feet on investigating the downing of a Ukrainian airliner near Tehran in January by not sharing information and not responding to requests for cooperation.
Iran has also rejected Kyiv's calls for life sentences for those responsible, Deputy Prosecutor General Gyunduz Mamedov told Reuters on Thursday, in written comments ahead of a third round of talks on the crash next month.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards say they shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 by accident on Jan. 8, mistaking it for a missile at a time when tensions with the United States were high; Washington had killed Revolutionary Guards commander Qassem Soleimani five days earlier with a drone strike in Iraq.
Many of the 176 people killed in the crash were Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
Iranian officials, who could not be reached on Friday, the weekend in Iran, have in the past blamed delays in the investigation on technical issues as well as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Our preliminary legal assessment of the tragedy is a particularly grave crime, where the killing of 176 civilians took place using military equipment,"" Mamedov said. 
""The maximum punishment is life imprisonment, compensation payments to the victims and to airlines for the destroyed plane. This position of ours is unacceptable for Iran, but they do nothing to provide us with details and facts for a different classification of the crime.""
Mamedov said Ukraine would pursue a ""parallel path"" if its demands were not met, without specifying what that meant. 
He said Iran had not responded to requests for joint investigative actions or for permission to contact Iranian military prosecutors directly. 
A governing panel at the United Nations' aviation agency urged Iran last week to accelerate its investigation, while an Iranian official said a final report on the crash would be circulated soon.
Mamedov said he wanted to see results at the next round of talks on Dec. 3. 
""We still do not have an official documented position from Iran,"" he said. ""They don't say 'no', but their 'yes' does not bring a development.""

""They aimed through attacks on mosques and the killing and wounding of as many Muslims as possible to create civil war-like conditions,"" prosecutors said in a statement.
Prosecutors said the suspects, 11 gang members and one accomplice, had met regularly to plan, with all but one of them pledging to contribute thousands towards a 50,000-euro ($59,000) pot to finance the purchase of weapons.
The suspects are all Germans and all but one of them has been detained. The twelfth is still at large, prosecutors in the southeastern city of Stuttgart said.
Another had died while in custody. No further details were immediately available regarding the circumstances of his death.
Germany has experienced a spate of right-wing attacks in recent years directed at minorities and those perceived to support them.
Members of the so-called National Socialist Underground were convicted in 2018 for a decade-long spree of murders of ethnic Turks. Last year, another right-wing extremist targeted a synagogue in Eastern Germany, killing two bystanders.
A suspected far-right sympathiser is on trial for killing conservative politician Walter Luebcke. Luebcke, a vocal supporter of Chancellor Angela Merkel, had called for refugees to be given the support and welcome they needed during the 2015 refugee crisis.

The 20-year-old Vienna native armed with an assault rifle, handgun and machete killed four people in a part of the city centre with many bars that also houses Vienna's main synagogue, which was closed at the time. He was shot dead by police.
""No one else was immediately involved in carrying out this crime on Nov. 2. What we cannot yet say definitively is to what extent accomplices provided support before the act,"" the police official leading the investigation, Michael Lohnegger, told a news conference. 
Vienna prosecutors' office spokeswoman Nina Bussek said the number of people remanded in custody over the attack was unchanged at 10, and 21 people in total were under investigation, aged 16-28. As yet unknown additional accomplices are still being looked for.
Austria has admitted to an intelligence failure before the attack since it mishandled information that the attacker tried to buy ammunition in Slovakia in July, and that he met known foreign Islamists that month - two from Germany who were under surveillance and two from Switzerland who have been arrested. 
It remains unclear how the attacker carrying weapons, ammunition and a dummy explosives belt travelled to the city centre more than 10 days ago.
""What we can currently actually rule out here is that the perpetrator arrived at the crime scene by public transport,"" Lohnegger said, adding that other forms of transport including taxis were still being worked on.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The mass resignation of Hong Kong's opposition lawmakers leaves the pro-democracy movement with no clear option in its fight against Communist Party rulers in Beijing, one of the outgoing legislators said on Friday, but she promised not to give up.
""It’s okay to lose. It’s not okay to quit,"" Claudia Mo told Reuters in her office where she was packing up old campaign posters in cardboard boxes. ""We will be back."" 
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed government expelled four opposition members from the Legislative Council on Wednesday for endangering national security after China's parliament gave city authorities new powers to curb dissent.
The remaining opposition members quit in solidarity.
Mo, of the HK First party, said the coronavirus and a sweeping national security law prevented the resumption of last year's months-long anti-government, anti-China street protests that swept the territory.
""So what next? We don’t know, as of today,"" said Mo, a lawmaker during both the Umbrella Movement's 79-day occupation of key roads in 2014 and last year's often-violent protests, both demanding universal suffrage for the former British colony.
""You can’t expect two million Hong Kong people taking to the streets again in the near future, no way. And the legislative fight has been put to an end, basically. I really don’t know the right way.""
Opposition members have tried to make a stand against what many people see as Beijing's whittling away of freedoms promised to Hong Kong under the ""one country, two systems"" formula under which it returned to China in 1997.
China denies curbing rights and freedoms in the financial hub but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved decisively to stifle dissent, especially with the national security legislation which punishes what China broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Britain said on Thursday China had broken its main bilateral treaty on Hong Kong by imposing new rules to disqualify elected legislators, cautioning that it would consider sanctions as part of its response.
The fate of Hong Kong's political opposition has been in doubt since the government, citing coronavirus risks, postponed September's legislative elections by a year.
Critics saw that as a bid to kill the pro-democracy camp's momentum as it hoped for the first time to build a majority in the assembly.
But Mo was optimistic the pro-democracy movement will eventually make a comeback.

""The spirit is still there,"" she said.

Turkey's Western allies, rights activists and opposition politicians have all called for the release of Kavala, detained since October 2017 without conviction, saying his continued detention pointed to political pressure on the judiciary.
Kavala and eight others were acquitted in February of charges related to street protests in 2013 that threatened the grip on power of then-premier, now President Tayyip Erdogan. But he was re-arrested the same day on charges related to a failed military coup in 2016, in which he has denied any role.
The European Court of Human Rights ruled in December for his release. Erdogan has criticised ECHR rulings but said in a speech on Wednesday Turkey would strengthen the rule of law.
In the latest development, Turkey's Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSK) issued a request for all rulings keeping Kavala jailed, the indictment against him and court records.
The document, dated Nov. 11 and marked ""urgent"", said the information was sought in relation to a review of judges and prosecutors' promotions, based on whether they upheld the rulings of the ECHR and Turkey's Constitutional Court.
Kavala has been jailed for more than three years without a conviction. The second indictment against him, which Amnesty International called ""absurd"", was accepted by an Istanbul court last month.
Erdogan and his AK Party deny claims of political pressure on the judiciary, saying it is independent.
Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said on Thursday detention during a trial should be an exception.

CULIACAN, Mexico (Reuters) - The children of former drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman helped build a makeshift school near the Mexican city of Culiacan for families who have no access to online classes during the coronavirus pandemic, residents said. 
Now serving a life sentence in a U.S. prison, El Chapo is revered as a fallen folk hero and a community benefactor by some in his home state Sinaloa - despite the drug gang he headed unleashing violence in the state and elsewhere.
Some of El Chapo's children, meanwhile, are following in his footsteps and have risen up the ranks of the Sinaloa cartel, heading a new wing of the crime gang, known as ""Los Chapitos"". [nL2N27A13G]
Last year, Los Chapitos garnered global headlines and enhanced the family's outlaw reputation when they laid siege to the state capital Culiacan to force the police to release Ovidio Guzman, one of their siblings.
Esmeralda Quinonez, a community leader in the Bicentennial Extension, an impoverished settlement north of Culiacan, said some El Chapo's children had contacted her to enquire about what was needed most in the area and put up a makeshift school in just days. 
""Thank God, the children of El Chapo heard about the situation here and showed solidarity,"" Quinonez said. 
Reuters was unable to contact El Chapo's children for comment. The Sinaloa state government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Juan Alfonso Mejia, the state's education minister who visited the school last week, told Reuters ""the relevant authorities will have to find out who equipped the school"".
But he lauded the community's efforts at the school, saying ""it was incredible work that they are doing"" during a difficult time in the middle of a pandemic. 
Decorated with the JGL, the initials of Joaquin Guzman Loera, El Chapo's full name, the new school is equipped with study and teaching materials, books as well as television sets, computers and internet. Quinonez said uniforms and shoes were also provided.
Many children in the impoverished neighborhood stopped studying altogether when schools closed because of the pandemic, locals said. Schools remain closed across Mexico. 
Families often live off what parents earn working on the vast landfill nearby, in homes with no internet connection or place that would allow their children to follow online and televised classes being broadcast by Mexican authorities during the pandemic.
""The idea is that children can learn while their parents are working in the landfill, and that they do not worry about food either, so this has motivated dozens of parents to send their children to this temporary school,"" Quinonez said. 
Between 70 and 90 children from different educational levels can now follow classes - either watching television or over the internet - at the site, where they are supported by volunteer teachers. 
One of the teachers, Adilene Herrera, said she started helping children with their school work in her free time when she saw them on the streets all day, until their parents returned from work.

The TASS and RIA news agencies named the executive on Thursday as Dmitry Fedotkin and said he denied any wrongdoing. 
Fedotkin's profile on the Linkedin website says he has been Aeroflot's station manager in Britain for the last five years and was the airline's UK country manager for almost three years before that. 
One unnamed Russian source was cited by Russian news agencies as saying Fedotkin had passed secrets pertaining to Russia's social and political situation to Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service, but did not have access to state secrets linked to the aviation industry. 
Aeroflot said it did not have any information about the case, while the British embassy in Moscow referred questions to Russian authorities.
Records from Moscow's Lefortovsky District Court show it opened a state treason case against an individual named D.A. Fedotkin on Wednesday.
If convicted of high treason, he could face up to 20 years in jail.
Relations between London and Moscow sank to a post-Cold War low over the 2018 poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence operative who betrayed Russian agents to MI6.
Russia periodically detains soldiers, scientists and state employees on suspicion of passing state secrets to foreign countries. 
The Federal Security Service (FSB) last month detained a serviceman and his brother in western Russia for having allegedly passed state secrets to Estonia.

GAHKUCH, Pakistan (Reuters) - As night falls on a remote mountain road in northern Pakistan, Ijaz ul Haq, 22, is keeping his grocery store open longer than usual, hoping to cash in on a frenzied electoral campaign that has brought the nation's interest upon this otherwise neglected region. 
Political parties are trying to sway voters in Gilgit-Baltistan, an impoverished, remote and rugged mountainous part of the larger Kashmir region that is also claimed by India. The country's top politicians have turned up here to stump, vowing to build multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects, and end decades of disenfranchisement.
Gilgit-Baltistan, which borders Afghanistan and China, is the gateway of the $65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) infrastructure plan. But the region has so far reaped few rewards.
""Look at this road we have, it takes 4.5 hours to get to a decent hospital from here. If they fixed the road it would take 1.5 hours,"" said Haq, who lives in Thawoos, a tiny hamlet in the district of Ghizer.
Locals fought pro-India forces and opted to join Pakistan in 1948. But since then Gilgit-Baltistan has not been granted full inclusion by the Pakistani constitution, over fears doing so would jeopardize Islamabad's international stance that all of Kashmir is disputed territory. 
The local assembly, for which the Nov. 15 elections are being held, has few powers. Pakistan's National Assembly and Senate have no representation from Gilgit-Baltistan, and the region receives only a fraction of the national budget.
This month Prime Minister Imran Khan said he would provide provisional provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan, giving it greater political representation, but no timeline has been given.
The announcement came a year after India changed the status of the portion of Kashmir it controls, taking away some of the region's privileges. India rejects Khan's plan to change Gilgit-Baltistan's status, and it calls the election there an exercise to cover up Pakistan's occupation of the region.
Khan's plan is not the first time locals have heard promises of being granted constitutional rights: in 2016 then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif proposed to make Gilgit-Baltistan a province as well, but shelved plans after pro-Pakistan leaders in Indian-administered Kashmir denounced the decision.
""We've long said we want to be part of Pakistan, but they push us away,"" said Yawar Abbas, a local leader with the Gilgit-Baltistan Awareness Forum, which seeks to alter the region's constitutional status.
Abbas says the disputed status has left locals in limbo, unable to enjoy the same rights as other Pakistanis, but also unable to enjoy autonomy.
BROKEN DREAMS
Graves of fallen soldiers marked by Pakistani flags dot the Ghizer district, which has the country's highest per-capita rate of military recruitment. 
""There is rampant poverty here, and for many of us there is no other way to earn a living than joining the military,"" said Haq, whose brother serves in the navy. 
In the winter, when the glacial melt that powers the small hydroelectric dams dotting the region slows, locals often have no power for 20 hours a day. 
The CPEC project was supposed to bring development to the region, but that has not happened, a consequence, residents believe, of the lack of local representation at national levels.
New roads, two hydroelectric power plants, a fiber-optic internet line, and a special economic zone to boost industrial activities have all been proposed as part of the CPEC project, but none have been materialized so far. 
The only substantial project from the much-touted China-Pakistan partnership has been the construction of the Karakoram Highway, completed decades ago.
Like most other candidates, Jamil Ahmed, has promised voters he would seek to draw more investment from China. 

""CPEC is going through here, we are the gateway, we are the door to China. So if someone opens the door for you, you should put something at the doorstep as well,"" said Ahmed, a candidate with the Pakistan Peoples Party.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Seeking to end a dangerous military standoff in the western Himalayas, India and China are formulating a plan that involves creating no-patrol zones, pulling back tanks and artillery, and using drones to verify the withdrawal, Indian officials say.
Tensions have run high since June, when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs. Indian officials say the Chinese troops had intruded across the disputed border in a remote valley. China said the Indian soldiers' actions had been provocative. 
Since then, the nuclear armed Asian neighbours have deployed tens of thousands of troops on the rugged frontier between India's Ladakh region and the Chinese-held Tibetan plateau, raising the risk of further confrontation even while looking for ways to de-escalate.
After months of fitful progress, the two sides are discussing a staggered disengagement from the high-altitude desert where temperatures have dipped to 18 degrees below Celsius, three Indian government officials said. 
""We have a firm plan for disengagement on the table, it is being internally discussed on both sides,"" said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Under the plan that was shared during a meeting of top commanders last Friday, both sides will pull back from the contested Pangong Tso lake area and establish a buffer zone.
Chinese soldiers will dismantle defence structures on several hilly spurs overlooking the lake and pull back, the officials briefed on the discussions said.
India, which has occupied heights on the lake's south bank, will also withdraw. Both sides will cease patrolling certain sections.
The 3,800-km long India-China border is undemarcated, and the two countries went to war in 1962.
While there have been recurrent incidents down the years, troops from both sides have largely abided by a long-standing protocol to avoid firing weapons on the high altitude border, although some warning shots were fired in September.
India's defence and foreign ministries declined to comment on the specifics of the latest negotiations. 
""When we have something to share, we will share. Discussions are ongoing,"" foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said.
The three officials said that military commanders from both sides could meet within a week for further discussions on disengagement. 
There was no immediate comment from China, but the state-controlled Global Times newspaper cited unnamed sources saying a disengagement plan was under discussion where India would first withdraw troops who had ""illegally crossed lines"" south of Pangong Tso.
Finding a mutually acceptable sequence for withdrawal could be complicated. Indian troops currently occupy heights on the southern shore of the lake, overlooking Chinese positions.
""If we empty out from there, there is nothing to negotiate,” a second Indian official said.
Under the plan outlined by Indian officials, tanks and artillery that two sides had deployed following the clash in June would be moved back from the frontline. 
They were also discussing a way to verify the troop withdrawal including the use of drones over the disputed areas at specific times each day, one of the Indian officials said. 

""If you are going to establish buffer zones, verification is the key to this,"" the official said.

Nicknamed the ""Bulldozer"", Magufuli was declared the winner of polls last month after securing 84% of the vote, although the opposition have rejected the results, alleging widespread irregularities.
Magufuli's choice to retain Mpango signals confidence in a minister who helped execute policies which, according to official figures, contributed to average growth of 6.9% during his first term, propelling Tanzania to low middle income status. 
As finance minister since 2015, Mpango helped the president push through an industrialisation drive and implementation of big infrastructure projects, including a new rail line, hydropower dam and a revival of the national carrier.
Magufuli told lawmakers on Friday his government aims to expand the economy by at least 8% and one of his key priority for his second term is continued reforms of the mining sector.
""There are some people who have been issued with exploration and mining licences but they have not worked on them, we will revoke the licences and distribute the areas to small and artisanal miners,"" he told lawmakers. 
""The steps that we will take in the next five years will help the mining sector to contribute at least 10% of the GDP by 2025.""
Gerson Msigwa, the director of presidential communications, said in a statement that the president had also re-appointed another ally, Palamagamba Kabudi, as minister of foreign affairs.

The Guerguerat crossing is the main land connection between Morocco and West Africa.
Morocco's army said it had erected a security cordon early on Friday and would carry out an operation to restore traffic.It said it would use arms only for ""legitimate defence.""A senior foreign ministry source said Morocco would set up sand barriers to protect the road. 
Polisario had previously threatened to respond if any Morocco military or civilian personnel enters the Guerguerat area, warning it could ""put an end to the ceasefire and trigger a new war"". 
Pro-Polisario protesters have for weeks blocked the road where it passes through a U.N.-monitored buffer zone near the Mauritanian border after a U.N. Security Council resolution that included language seen as favourable to Morocco. 
In a statement the Foreign Ministry said Morocco ""had no other choice but to assume its responsibilities in order to put an end to the blockade ... and restore the free flow of civilian and commercial traffic"". 
Morocco took over the desert territory in 1975 when Spanish rule there ended and considers the phosphate-rich region part of its own country. 
The Algeria-backed Polisario movement seeks independence for Western Sahara. 
Last month the U.N. Security Council passed resolution 2548 which called for a ""realistic, practicable and enduring solution... based on compromise"". 
That language was widely seen as calling into doubt any referendum on the territory's future - a goal long sought by the Polisario and backed by the United Nations in 1991.

The jihadist suicide bombers and gunmen killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more in a series of coordinated attacks on entertainment venues on Nov. 13, 2015, in a night of bloodletting that etched a deep scar in the nation's psyche.
Castex went first to the Stade de France, where the attack began with suicide blasts outside the stadium during a soccer match attended by then president Francois Hollande. He laid a wreath of flowers at the foot of a wall. 
The assault also targeted cafes, restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall - sites which have been under a close police watch in the run-up to Friday's anniversary.
France is reeling again from a wave of attacks since early September: a stabbing outside the former offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine, the beheading of a history teacher who had shown his class cartoons mocking the Prophet Mohammad and a deadly knife attack in a church in Nice. 
""We face a double-edged threat: from outside, people sent from abroad, and a grave internal threat, people who are amongst us, our enemies within. Those threats are increasing,"" Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told franceinfo radio.

""We respect the choice of the American people. We extend congratulations to Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular daily briefing, referring to Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris.
""We understand the results of the U.S. election will be determined according to U.S. laws and procedures,"" he added, repeating Beijing's earlier stance.
Trump's refusal to accept defeat has put Beijing in an awkward position, with China loath to do anything to antagonize Trump, who has mounted court challenges to the balloting and remains in office until the Jan 20 inauguration.
Relations between China and the United States are at their worst in decades over disputes ranging from technology and trade to Hong Kong and the coronavirus, and the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of sanctions against Beijing.
Shortly after Biden's win following days of ballot counting in several swing states, numerous U.S. allies offered congratulations, while the leaders of China and Russia were among conspicuous holdouts. 

In 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent congratulations to Trump on Nov. 9, a day after the election.

Nationalist Orban, who has been in power for over a decade and has been criticised for an erosion of democracy in Hungary, a former communist state, said ""Hungarians' money cannot be taken away"" and ongoing EU debates about the criteria were ""technical.""
Orban said he talked with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday about the regulation.
""I had to tell her that if this regulation drafted by the European parliament and the German presidency were to be accepted -- it requires two-thirds majority so we cannot block this -- then we have made Soviet Union out of the EU,"" Orban told state radio.
He said the criteria would amount to ""blackmail on an ideological basis without objective criteria"".
""This is not what we wanted ... we did not create the EU for having a second Soviet Union,"" Orban added, stopping short of threatening to veto the entire EU budget process.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Orban's main ally, has sent a letter to European Union institutions threatening to veto its 2021-2027 budget if access to EU funds is made conditional on governments respecting the rule of law.
The conditionality was a key concern for the European Parliament and several north European countries such as the
Netherlands, which wanted even stricter conditions.
Poland and Hungary have the power to veto the long-term budget and prevent any member state getting EU funding.
But this would also harm both countries, which are big net

beneficiaries of the budget where many supporters of the ruling nationalist parties depend heavily on direct EU subsidies.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia sought to tighten its grip on the rebellious Tigray region on Friday by appointing a new local leader during a military offensive that has killed hundreds and shaken the wider Horn of Africa region.
Federal troops' 10-day push against the northern state has sent refugees flooding into Sudan and raised fears it may suck in Eritrea or weaken an African force opposing Islamist militants in Somalia if Ethiopia diverts troops from there.
It may also blemish the reputation of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for a 2018 peace pact with Eritrea and had won plaudits for opening Ethiopia's economy and easing a repressive political system. 
Abiy accuses the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which rules the mountainous region of more than five million people, of treason and terrorism. They say he has systematically persecuted Tigrayans since taking office in April 2018. 
The conflict began last week when Abiy says the TPLF attacked a military base, since when his army has been carrying out air strikes and ground combat which the government says has ""liberated"" west Tigray. 
Abiy, who comes from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group the Oromo, said parliament had named former Addis Ababa university professor and deputy minister for science and higher education Mulu Nega, 52, as chief executive of Tigray.
""The Chief Executive will recruit and appoint heads to lead executive organs of the regional state from political parties legally operating in the region,"" he tweeted.
Current Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael, who won a local election in September despite central government orders to cancel it, has been formally accused along with other TPLF officials of treason, armed rebellion and terrorism. 
They say their region has been invaded.
There was no immediate response from Debretsion or other TPLF figures to Friday's appointment. A dissertation by Mulu, published on the web site of Twente University in the Netherlands where he obtained a doctorate in 2012, states his place of birth as Tigray.
ETHIOPIAN AT AU REMOVED
News also came on Friday that the African Union (AU) had dismissed its security head, an Ethiopian national, after Abiy's government accused him of disloyalty.
The bloc's chair Moussa Faki Mahamat ordered the removal of Gebreegziabher Mebratu Melese in a Nov. 11 memo seen by Reuters after Ethiopia's defence ministry wrote with concerns. 
An AU official confirmed the two letters. The defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Horn of Africa expert Rashid Abdi said Gebreegziabher was Tigrayan and his departure from the AU post was part of the Abiy government's efforts to sideline prominent Tigrayans.
""The purging of competent Tigrayan officials in the midst of the conflict is not good for the morale of the (security and military) services,"" he said, referring also to other removals of Tigrayan officials since the military offensive began. 
""It also plays into the notion that this is essentially an ethnic war masked as a centre-periphery power struggle.""
Abiy's opening of political space since taking office in 2018 has exposed ethnic fractures in Africa's second most populous nation of 115 million people. Before the Tigray flare-up, clashes killed hundreds and uprooted hundreds of thousands.
Communications in Tigray are cut and media have been barred, but security sources have told Reuters hundreds of combatants have been killed on both sides. 
Both sides have accused each other of harming civilians. 
Rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday that scores and possibly hundreds of civilians were stabbed and hacked to death in the region on Nov. 9, citing witnesses who blamed the TPLF. Debretsion denied that in comments to Reuters.
More than 11,000 Ethiopian refugees - half of them children - have gone to Sudan since fighting started and aid agencies say the situation in Tigray is becoming dire. Even before the conflict, 600,000 people there were reliant on food aid.
Ethiopia's national army is one of Africa's largest and highest-trained. But its best fighters are from Tigray and much of its hardware is also there, under the Northern Command.
Ethiopia hosts the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa. Nearly 4,400 Ethiopian troops serve in its Somalia peacekeeping force.

China calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its ties with the United States, and has been angered by the Trump administration's stepped up support for the Chinese-claimed yet democratically ruled island, such as arms sales.
Speaking in a U.S. radio interview on Thursday, Pompeo said: ""Taiwan has not been a part of China"".
""That was recognised with the work that the Reagan administration did to lay out the policies that the United States has adhered to now for three-and-a-half decades,"" he said.
The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, and officially only acknowledges the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of it, rather than explicitly recognising China's claims.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Taiwan was an inalienable part of China and that Pompeo was further damaging Sino-U.S. ties.
""We solemnly tell Pompeo and his ilk, that any behaviour that undermines China's core interests and interferes with China's domestic affairs will be met with a resolute counterattack by China,"" he said, without elaborating.
China has put sanctions on U.S. companies selling weapons to Taiwan, and flew fighter jets near the island when senior U.S. officials visited Taipei this year.
The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after loosing a civil war to the communists, who founded the People's Republic of China.
Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman, Joanne Ou, thanked Pompeo for his support.
""The Republic of China on Taiwan is a sovereign, independent country, and not part of the People's Republic of China. This is a fact and the current situation,"" she said.

Taiwan officials will travel to Washington next week for economic talks, which have also annoyed Beijing.

The use of seals will be abolished for all but 83 instances such as automobile registration, the official said, affecting transactions carried out by millions of Japanese every day. The official said no specific timetable has been set for phasing out seal use.
The radical switch comes as newly installed Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga seeks to boost use of digital technology to streamline processes and spur lacklustre growth in the world's third-biggest economy. 
A custom originally imported from China more than a thousand years ago, the use of seals - 'hanko' in Japanese - was formalised by Japan's government in the mid-1800s.
With far more people working from home in Japan than previously amid the coronavirus pandemic, the custom has come under criticism with millions of workers forced to commute to their offices because of the need for contracts and proposals to be stamped using the seals.

Kono's move triggered an angry response last week from the All Japan Seal Industry Association, representing 890 seal manufacturers and retailers that serve a population of about 126 million.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling party said on Friday it would seek to form a government of national unity after official election results showed it had comfortably won enough parliamentary seats to form the next administration.
The latest batch of results from Sunday's vote confirmed Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) had secured the 322 seats in the bicameral legislature needed to form a government. 
The NLD has taken 368 seats of the 434 seats that have been declared, with results from 42 more yet to be announced.
NLD spokesman Monywa Aung Shin said the ""landslide"" win showed that the people still had faith in Suu Kyi's leadership. 
""However, we have to work on forming a national unity government,"" said Monywa Aung Shin, noting how the NLD had invited 39 ethnic minority parties to work with it.
Myanmar has seen insurgencies by various autonomy-seeking guerrilla forces since shortly after its independence from Britain in 1948, and Suu Kyi's government has been trying to conclude peace efforts though progress has been patchy and violence has flared in some areas.
Ethnic minority political parties have been competing for seats in the national parliament as well as in their state assemblies.
The NLD's comfortable win will be a welcome boost for Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace laureate who has had a turbulent first term and struggled to meet high public expectations. 
She is tasked with developing a country that suffered nearly 50 years of isolation and decay under strict military rule, years of which she was held under house arrest.
Even now, her government is required to govern with military involvement, in particular in the areas of security and defence, under a constitution drafted during the generals' rule.
The NLD won by a similar margin in the last election in 2015, the first free vote since the end of military rule.
This time, the ballot was seen as a referendum on Suu Kyi's government, which is hugely popular at home. But its reputation abroad has collapsed due to accusations of genocide against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, which it denies.
OPPOSITION OBJECTIONS
The main opposition party, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), had won 24 seats, according to the partial official results. 
The USDP raised objections on Wednesday and demanded a new vote as soon as possible ""in order to have an election that is free, fair, unbiased and free from unfair campaigning"".
A USDP spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.
International and domestic observers said the vote went smoothly and without major irregularities.
The election commission on Wednesday said any allegations of irregularities were from a minority of participants.
The NLD has also demanded proof of wrongdoing, while the military, in an earlier statement, said the election had been carried out successfully.
While the election appeared to go mostly smoothly, more than a million people were unable to vote after polls were cancelled due to insurgencies.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, Muslim minority people many of whom are confined to camps and villages inside Myanmar's western Rakhine State, most without citizenship, were also unable to vote.
The Arakan Army, an insurgent group fighting for greater autonomy for Rakhine, called in a statement on the army and the NLD government to ensure by-elections were held in areas where polls were cancelled.

The former Malian army colonel, also known as Bamoussa Diarra, was a right-hand man of Iyad Ag Ghali, the leader of Mali's most prominent jihadi group, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), which has repeatedly attacked soldiers and civilians in Mali and neighbouring Burkina Faso.
""A historic figure of the jihadist movement in the Sahel, Bah ag Moussa is considered responsible for several attacks against Malian and international forces"", Parly said in a statement.
Moussa, who was on the U.S. terrorism list, was killed on Tuesday after an operation involving ground troops and helicopters and comes after a series of operations that have seen French forces kill dozens of Islamist fighters in recent weeks. 
""This is a major success in the fight against terrorism,"" Parly said.
Former colonial power France has more than 5,100 personnel spread across the region with a large portion in Mali operating against rising militancy.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian interim President Manuel Merino called for calm as he swore in his new cabinet on Thursday amid protests that have escalated around the country since the abrupt ouster of former leader Martin Vizcarra.
Merino, whose cabinet was filled with mostly technocrats, accused some critics planning to run in 2021 elections of inciting protests that have broken out in Lima and other cities and urged Peruvians to maintain peace. 
""We respect those who have a dissenting opinion, but we call for calm and responsibility so that any political expression is given within the scope of tranquility and non-violence,"" Merino said in a speech after the swearing-in of his cabinet of 18 officials.
Merino assumed office on Tuesday after the Andean nation's fractured Congress voted to oust Vizcarra over bribery allegations. The political shakeup comes as Peru, pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic, is bracing for its worst economic contraction in a century. 
Merino appointed Jose Arista, a former farms minister and deputy finance minister, to the key economy portfolio. Carlos Herrera was appointed to the powerful energy and mining ministry after already served twice in the post.
""We are not going to produce any traumatic change, the state must continue to function and respect the professional and technical work in all areas,"" Merino said.
Crowds have gathered in the streets for days to protest the Congress vote, with dozens of demonstrators detained after clashes with police who have at times used tear gas, prompting concern from some human rights organizations.
On Thursday night thousands took to the streets in Lima, banging pots and carrying banners to protest against the new government.
""Enough of the corruption, that's why I'm here with my pot, shouting,"" said teacher Rosario Mendoza, while protesting in the capital. ""Neither Congress nor the president who they have installed represent me.""
The Organization of American States (OAS) also expressed concern on Wednesday over the ""new political crisis in Peru,"" urging the country's Constitutional Court to weigh in.
Vizcarra, arriving at a prosecutor's office that is investigating him, said that protests reflected people's dissatisfaction with the situation. He also criticized the appointment of conservative politician Antero Flores-Araoz.
""It's like going back to the past, to traditional politics,"" he said. ""The people have given Mr. Merino their answer."" 

The political turmoil has shaken markets with Peru's sol currency dipping 0.5% on Thursday to an 18-year low.

""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" the groups said about the Nov. 3 election won by Joe Biden, a Democrat. 
Republican President Donald Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and has yet to concede. 
The groups, the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee (GCC) and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council (SCC), said the election was the most secure in U.S. history. 
""While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections and you should too,"" the groups said in the statement released by the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). 
CISA has drawn the ire of the Trump White House over a website it runs dubbed ""Rumor Control"" which debunks misinformation about the election, according to the three people familiar with the matter. 
Top U.S. cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs, who worked on protecting the election from hackers, has told associates he expects to be fired, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
White House officials have asked for content to be edited or removed that pushed back against numerous false claims about the election, including that Democrats are behind a mass election fraud scheme. CISA officials have chosen not to delete accurate information.

The security groups said all the states with close results in the race have paper records of each vote, which can be counted if necessary.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's most populous province Ontario may have to begin suspending non-essential surgeries again starting in two weeks as surging coronavirus cases fill hospital intensive care units, according to modeling released on Thursday.
Rising cases in neighboring Quebec prompted the province's government to weigh temporary school closures, while Alberta, which has Canada's second-highest rate of active cases, banned group fitness and team sports for two weeks in some regions.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was scheduled to talk to premiers on Thursday about the spread of the virus, having already urged them to do more.
Ontario's data puts the province on track to hit 6,500 new cases per day by the end of December with a 5% increase per day. It reported a record 1,575 new cases on Thursday.
The province of 14.6 million people will reach 150 ICUs filled by COVID-19 patients in two weeks, in all projected scenarios.
""This threshold of 150 beds is important because it's that point at which we need to start cancelling planned surgeries,"" said Dr. Steini Brown, co-chair of Ontario's COVID-19 science advisory table, emphasizing that ""key indicators"" in the province ""continue to worsen.""
Ontario is close to a 6% case increase based on the past few days of data and Brown said it was reasonable to think 5% is a ""current or even slightly optimistic scenario.""
On Thursday, Premier Doug Ford defended his government's reopening framework issued last week. On Wednesday, the Toronto Star newspaper reported he ignored expert advice in creating a framework that sets a cap of 10% of tests coming back positive before stricter regulations take effect.
Quebec, Canada's worst hit province, on Thursday reported an additional 1,365 cases and 42 deaths.
Quebec Premier Francois Legault told reporters he would speak with unions about possibly extending the school year into summer if needed. Another option is extending Christmas break.

""For me, this is the last solution,"" Legault said of closing schools. ""But we cannot exclude any solution.""

847,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>","Australia forecasts prolonged wildfire seasons, more droughts from climate change","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's climate will continue to warm, resulting in prolonged wildfire seasons and less rain in the southeast and southwest that will lead to more frequent droughts, the country's weather bureau said on Friday.
Australia's changing climate patterns can be attributed to an increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere triggering more extreme weather events, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) said in its biennial climate report. 
Australia's climate has warmed on average by 1.44 degrees Celsius since 1910 and this will result in more wild fires, droughts, and marine heat waves, the report said. 
""Climate change is influencing these trends through its impact on temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity, and the resulting change to the fuel moisture content,"" BoM scientist Karl Braganza said.
Fires razed more than 11 million hectares (37 million acres) of bushland across the southeast early this year, killing at least 33 people and billions of native animals - a disaster that Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Australia's ""black summer"".
Though COVID-19 lockdowns helped cut global emissions, they were not enough to reduce the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, said the report, prepared in collaboration with Australia's national science agency CSIRO.
Morrison has refused to match other developed countries in setting a target for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but has said that the country, in line with the Paris accord, expects to reach net zero emissions after 2050.
Longer-lasting marine heat waves will raise the likelihood of more frequent bleaching events in coral reefs, including the Great Barrier reef. 

""These trends, which are projected to continue in the coming decades, are already posing a significant threat to the long-term health and resilience of the coral reef ecosystems around Australia's coast,"" Director of CSIRO's Climate Science Centre Jaci Brown said.

Brazil's Bolsonaro questions the U.S. election,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a close ally of Republican President Donald Trump and one of the few prominent world leaders still not to have congratulated Democratic President-elect Joe Biden on his election win, asked on Thursday whether the vote in the U.S. was really over.
Talking to supporters outside his official residence, Bolsonaro was asked what he thought of the American election result.
""But has it finished, have the elections already finished?,"" he asked the supporter, breaking into a smile before posing for selfies. 
The Brazilian leader, who had vowed to be the first to congratulate Trump on his re-election, is approaching a week without passing on congratulations to Biden, who has been projected to win the majority of both the popular and electoral vote.
The Brazilian leader's posture could herald a rocky start in relations with Biden, whose agenda with Brazil would likely include addressing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) deforestation and human rights.
On Tuesday, he also took a swipe at Biden referring to him as a ""candidate"" and taking issue with a comment Biden said during a U.S. presidential debate that Brazil should fight deforestation with foreign help or face unspecified ""economic consequences.""
""We saw recently there a great candidate for head of state say that if I don't put out the fire in the Amazon, he will put up commercial barriers against Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said.
""And how can we deal with all that? Just diplomacy is not enough ... When saliva runs out, one has to have gunpowder, otherwise it doesn't work.""

The arrival on Tuesday of the peacekeepers to oversee the ceasefire between Azeri troops and ethnic Armenian forces in the enclave extends Russia's military footprint among the former Soviet republics it views as its strategic back yard.
Moscow co-chairs an international group overseeing the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute with Washington and Paris, but they were not involved in the deal signed by Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan to end six weeks of fighting over the enclave.
France's population includes between 400,000 to 600,000 people of Armenian origin and President Emmanuel Macron has been careful not to back one side or the other in the conflict. However, he has increasingly come under fire from opponents at home, who argue that he did not do enough to help Yerevan.
In a statement on Thursday, Macron's office said he had sought to reassure Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.
""The President expressed his satisfaction with the end of the fighting, recalled his friendship for Armenia and its people as well as his readiness to build a fair, lasting and acceptable political solution for all parties in Nagorno-Karabakh,"" the statement said.
Macron had also convened a meeting of aid agencies and key members of the diaspora to assess Armenia's humanitarian needs. 
However, the statement appeared to stop short of comments earlier this week in which the presidency had been cautious about the Russian-brokered deal and said any lasting agreement needed to take into consideration the interests of Armenia.

France and the United States are expected to send diplomats to Moscow soon to discuss the conflict.

(Reuters) - The Trump campaign is surveying supporters over a perceived attack by Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, as the president continues to retaliate against a network he once saw as a defender.
The campaign surveys, which were emailed to supporters and available on its website this week, includes questions such as “Do you agree Fox News should recall their Arizona projection for Joe Biden?” and “Do you agree media outlets, such as Fox News, should be held accountable for misleading the public?”
Trump has complained about being treated unfairly by the news division of the network for months, even as Fox's opinion hosts support the president's demand to investigate potential voter fraud. 
He has urged supporters to watch smaller rival right-leaning networks Newsmax and One America News Network. He stepped up his criticism after Fox News, owned by Fox Corp, was the first network to project that Biden would win Arizona in the U.S. presidential election. 
Fox Corp shares were down 6% Thursday.
The Arizona projection, defended on multiple occasions on-air by Fox News and backed up by the Associated Press about three hours later, shifted the vote count and tenor of the election in favor of Biden. 
Trump's allies have argued that Trump, who has refused to concede the election to Biden, still has a shot of winning it. 
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Fox News declined to comment.
The surveys come amid a new report from Axios that Trump is considering starting a digital media company designed to undermine Fox News, citing unnamed sources. 
On Thursday Trump continued his attack on the network, tweeting ""@FoxNews daytime ratings have completely collapsed. Weekend daytime even WORSE. Very sad to watch this happen, but they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose. The biggest difference between the 2016 Election, and 2020, was @FoxNews!"" 
Fox News has had record ratings throughout the year. Its election coverage led all networks with 14.1 million prime-time viewers, according to Nielsen. 
Some Fox News anchors and reporters have pushed back on Trump administration charges of voter fraud. On Nov. 9 anchor Neil Cavuto cut out of the White House press briefing following claims by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany that Democrats were “welcoming fraud” and “welcoming illegal voting.”

On Nov 6, Fox News anchor and senior correspondent Eric Shawn said of claims that Republican poll watchers had been barred from observing the process in Philadelphia: “That's not true. It's not true. It's just not true.”

Some 2,500 Christmas markets are usually held in Germany in the lead-up to the holiday, drawing millions of visitors who sip mulled wine and buy trinkets among wooden huts. But most markets are likely to be cancelled this year due to the pandemic, including Nuremberg's world-famous ""Christkindlesmarkt.""

Witnesses say Roman Bondarenko was detained after scuffling with people in plain clothes who had come to a playground to remove red-and-white ribbons that represent the protest movement against veteran President Alexander Lukashenko. 
The interior ministry denied responsibility for Bondarenko's death, saying he was killed due to a scuffle with civilians. 
The death is the latest flashpoint in months of mass protests against Lukashenko following a disputed presidential election in August. The opposition says Lukashenko rigged the vote to secure a sixth successive term. 
Lukashenko denies electoral fraud and, buoyed by support from traditional ally Russia, has shown little inclination to step down. A violent crackdown prompted a new round of Western sanctions on Minsk. 
""Shocked by the death of Raman Bandarenka,"" Lithuania's Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said on Twitter. 
""Astonishing cynicism, cruelty of the regime and blunt ignorance of people's aspirations for changes.""
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who stood against Lukashenko in the election and then fled into exile, called Bondarenko a hero of Belarus. 
""Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of the emergency hospital doctors, the patient died,"" a statement by the health ministry said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Thursday said China had broken its main bilateral treaty on Hong Kong by imposing new rules to disqualify elected legislators in the former British colony, cautioning that it would consider sanctions as part of its response.
The British flag was lowered over Hong Kong when the colony was handed back to China in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule - imposed after Britain defeated China in the First Opium War.
Hong Kong's autonomy was guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration signed by then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
""Beijing's imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong constitutes a clear breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.
""China has once again broken its promises and undermined Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.""
Britain summoned China's ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, to express its deep concerns and Raab's deputy, Nigel Adams, told parliament that it was considering possible sanctions on individuals over China's actions.
""We will continue to consider designations under our Magnitsky-style sanctions regime,"" said Adams, Britain's minister for Asia, referring to sanctions similar to those imposed on those deemed responsible for human rights abuses under the U.S. Magnitski Act. He was asked by lawmakers if Britain would sanction Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.
Adams said it would not be helpful to speculate on names at this stage. China's embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The European Union called on Beijing to immediately reverse the new rules, which it said undermined Hong Kong's autonomy.
On Wednesday, the United States, which has already imposed sanctions on Lam and other Chinese officials over the crackdown, warned of further steps.
The U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said China had ""flagrantly violated its international commitments"" and Washington would ""continue to identify and sanction those responsible for extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom"".
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the Chinese Communist Party of using ""a twisted vision of patriotism ... to stifle freedom and the call for democracy"". 
""We will hold accountable the people responsible for these actions and policies,"" he said in a statement. 
Canada said on Thursday it would make it easier for Hong Kong youth to study and work in Canada in response to new security rules.
MAKING A STAND
Hong Kong's pro-democracy opposition lawmakers said on Wednesday they would resign in protest against the dismissal of four of their colleagues from the city assembly after Beijing gave local authorities new powers to further curb dissent.
The Chinese parliament earlier adopted a resolution allowing the city's executive to expel lawmakers deemed to be advocating Hong Kong independence, colluding with foreign forces or threatening national security, without having to go through the courts.
Opposition members of the Hong Kong assembly say they have tried to make a stand against what many people in Hong Kong see as Beijing's whittling away of freedoms and institutional checks and balances, despite a promise of a high degree of autonomy.
China denies curbing rights and freedoms in the global financial hub, but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved swiftly to stifle dissent after anti-government protests flared in June last year and plunged the city into crisis.
Britain now considers China has broken the Joint Declaration three times, including with the national security legislation for Hong Kong introduced this year.
""The UK will stand up for the people of Hong Kong, and call out violations of their rights and freedoms,"" Raab said.
The national security law punishes what China broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

Critics of the law fear it will crush freedoms, including freedom to protest and an independent judiciary. Supporters say it will bring stability after last year's sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China unrest.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Scores and possibly hundreds of labourers were stabbed and hacked to death in Ethiopia's Tigray region, rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday, as federal troops claimed major advances in their offensive against local forces.
""This is a horrific tragedy,"" Amnesty said in a statement, citing witnesses as blaming local rulers, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), for the killings, which it said took place two days ago.
Earlier, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had accused his foes of committing atrocities during a week of fighting that threatened to destabilise the Horn of Africa. Abiy said the Ethiopia military had defeated local forces in the west of the state.
Air strikes and ground combat have killed hundreds, sent refugees flooding into Sudan, stirred Ethiopia's ethnic divisions and raised questions over the credentials of Abiy, 44, Africa's youngest leader and winner of a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.
With communications down and media barred, independent verification of the status of the conflict was impossible.
Amnesty said in a gruesome report that the killings had taken place in the town of Mai Kadra in Tigray's southwest, and that witnesses described bodies with gaping wounds that appeared to have been inflicted with knives or machetes.
""Amnesty International has not yet been able to confirm who was responsible for the killings, but has spoken to witnesses who said forces loyal to the TPLF were responsible for the mass killings, apparently after they suffered defeat from the federal EDF (PA:EDF) forces,"" it said.
There was no immediate response from the Ethiopian government or Tigray's local leaders.
REFUGEES FLEE
There are fears the conflict may suck in Eritrea, whose government signed a peace pact with Abiy two years ago but remains hostile to the Tigrayan leadership. It may also weaken Ethiopia's role in an African Union force opposing Islamist militants in Somalia.
Major conflict could also hinder foreign investment in Ethiopia's economy, which had clocked nearly double-digit annual growth for years before the coronavirus hit and is liberalizing, with multinationals particularly eyeing the telecoms sector.
The TPLF, which rules the mountainous northern state of more than 5 million people, announced a state of emergency against what it termed an ""invasion"".
Abiy accuses the TPLF of starting the conflict by attacking a federal military base and defying his authority, while the Tigrayans say they have been persecuted during his two-year rule.
""The western region of Tigray has been liberated,"" tweeted Abiy, who comes from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromo, and once fought with the Tigrayans against neighbouring Eritrea. 
The prime minister said some of his soldiers had been found dead in the town of Sheraro, shot with their legs and arms tied behind their back. ""This kind of cruelty is heartbreaking,"" he said. 
He did not say how many bodies were found or provide proof. Reuters could not verify his allegation and there was no immediate response from the TPLF, which has accused federal troops of being ""merciless"" in bombing Tigrayans.
More than 11,000 Ethiopian refugees have crossed into Sudan since fighting started and aid agencies say the situation in Tigray is becoming dire. Even before the conflict, 600,000 people there were reliant on food aid.
ARRESTS AND PROTESTS
The U.N. refugee agency's representative in Ethiopia, Ann Encontre, told Reuters negotiations were under way with both sides for humanitarian corridors.
A ""major emergency"" may be brewing with so many people escaping to Sudan, she warned. Half of the refugees were children and some were wounded.
After taking office in 2018, Abiy was applauded for opening up a repressive political system, including freeing activists from jail and lifting bans on opposition political parties. He won his Nobel prize for the peace accord with Eritrea.
But his democratic transition was already waning even before the push on Tigray, experts say, including jailing a prominent opposition member and restricting media. 
Abiy has so far resisted calls by the United Nations, the African Union and others for a ceasefire and talks.
The army said transitional rule would be set up in parts of Tigray and urged local forces to surrender.
In a wider push against the TPLF, Ethiopia's parliament stripped 39 members, including Tigray regional president Debretsion Gebremichael, of immunity from prosecution.
Police said they had arrested 242 TPLF activists suspected of plotting attacks in Addis Ababa. Weapons including bombs and bullets were also confiscated, the city's police chief said.
Also in the capital, volunteers lined up at a stadium to donate blood for injured armed forces members. Some waved the Ethiopian national flag. 

And in what seemed to be a government-backed attempt to win the propaganda war over Tigray, thousands marched in anti-TPLF protests in the Oromia, Somali and Afar regions, Fana reported.

Canada will also accelerate the processes for ""their spouses, their partners and their children to come and build the next chapter in their life"", Mendicino said. 
Hong Kong's autonomy was guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. Britain on Thursday said China had broken this treaty when it disqualified elected legislators this week.
Violations of the China's security law, or of any laws that Canada does not itself have on its books, will be disregarded when it evaluates requests for asylum, permanent residency or other permits from Hong Kong and anywhere else, Mendicino said. 
China's envoy to Canada, Cong Peiwu, warned Canada last month against granting asylum to pro-democracy protesters because he said they were ""violent criminals"" who threatened the ""health and safety"" of the 300,000 Canadian passport holders living in Hong Kong.
On Thursday, The Chinese embassy in Ottawa had no immediate comment. Study permit applications from Hong Kong are on the rise this year, the minister also said.
""Things are going to get worse, not better"" in Hong Kong, Vancouver-based immigration lawyer Richard Kurland said, adding that Hong Kong parents should consider sending their children to study in Canada.
After China initially announced it would put new national security legislation in place for Hong Kong in July, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suspended an extradition treaty with the city and banned the export of sensitive military items.
Canada's relations with China, the world's second biggest economy, soured after Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese citizen, was arrested in Vancouver in late 2018 on a bank fraud warrant issued by U.S. authorities.
Soon after, Beijing arrested two Canadian men it said were suspected of espionage, and Meng is now fighting extradition to the United States. China has also suspended most imports of canola.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Pope Francis offered his ""blessings and congratulations"" to U.S. President-elect Joe Biden in a phone call on Thursday, seeking to rebuild rapport with Washington after four years of sometimes contentious relations with President Donald Trump.
The conversation was announced by the transition team for Biden, who will become only the second Roman Catholic president in U.S. history when he enters the White House on Jan. 20. Trump has yet to concede and is pursuing legal challenges.
Francis has clashed with Trump on a number of issues, including China, climate change, Cuba and immigration.
""The president-elect thanked His Holiness for extending blessings and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,"" the transition team said in a statement.
""(Biden) expressed his desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities,"" it said.
In February 2016, when the Republican Trump was still a candidate for the presidency, Francis criticized his promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico, saying a man who wanted to build walls is ""not Christian.""
After Trump was elected, Francis criticized the president's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord to limit global warming and his administration's policy separating migrant families entering the United States.
In an interview with Reuters in 2018, Francis said he was saddened by Trump’s decision to roll back a deal the Vatican helped broker during the previous Obama administration to encourage trade and travel with Cuba.
Biden, who attends Mass on Sundays, will be the first American Catholic president since his fellow Democrat John F. Kennedy in the 1960s.

Conservative American Catholics, many of whom voted for Trump, have said priests should not give communion to Biden because of his views favoring abortion rights.

Eta, the 28th named storm of the busiest Atlantic hurricane season on record, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC), made its fourth landfall at around 4 a.m. on Thursday near Cedar Key, Florida, after it already slammed Central America, Cuba and the upper Florida Keys.
The storm had moved offshore into the Atlantic and was about 40 miles (65 km) north-northeast of Jacksonville on Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (65 kph), the NHC said.
Storm surge from Eta in Tampa Bay reached 3 to 4 feet (0.9-1.2 m) above ground inundation, the NHC's Storm Surge Unit said. The NHC forecasted that swells along the Florida Gulf coast today and the southeastern U.S. coast tonight would be ""life-threatening.""
Flooded streets in downtown Tampa resembled lakes and sailboats in Gulfport, a city on Tampa Bay, were beached and tipped over on Thursday, photos on Twitter showed.

863,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",U.S. court upholds Harvard race-based admissions; Supreme Court appeal expected,"By Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel
BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday upheld Harvard University's use of race in undergraduate admissions, rejecting a challenge by affirmative action opponents who said the Ivy League school's policy discriminates against Asian-Americans.
Opponents of the decision, by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, promised to appeal to the Supreme Court, where legal experts believe the 6-3 conservative majority could use the case to end more than 40 years of allowing race as a factor in higher education admissions.
The appeals court rejected claims by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a nonprofit founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, which drew support from Republican President Donald Trump's administration.
SFFA said Harvard engaged in impermissible ""racial balancing"" to make it easier for Blacks and Hispanics to win admission, and did not narrowly tailor its use of race.
It said this violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which the school must comply with in order to receive federal funding.
U.S. Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch, however, said Harvard's use of race was not ""impermissibly extensive"" and was instead ""meaningful,"" because it prevented diversity from plummeting.
""Harvard's race-conscious admissions program ensures that Harvard can retain the benefits of diversity it has already achieved,"" she said.
In a statement, Blum pledged to ask the Supreme Court ""to end these unfair and unconstitutional race-based admissions policies at Harvard and all colleges and universities.""
The Supreme Court has allowed race to be used in college admissions to promote diversity in the classroom.
Harvard President Lawrence Bacow said the university will continue defending its admissions practices.
""The consideration of race, alongside many other factors, helps us achieve our goal of creating a student body that enriches the education of every student,"" he said in a statement.
Thursday's 2-0 decision upheld an October 2019 ruling by U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston. A third judge on the appeals court panel, Juan Torruella, died last month.
Burroughs had concluded that Harvard's admissions program was ""not perfect"" but that the school had no ""workable and available race-neutral alternatives.""
Lynch said the nature of Harvard's admissions process, including that applicants win approval from a 40-person committee before being offered admission, ""offset any risk of bias.""
In a ""friend-of-the-court brief, the U.S. Department of Justice backed SFFA, saying Harvard ""actively engages in racial balancing that Supreme Court precedent flatly forbids.""
The Justice Department filed a similar lawsuit on Oct. 8 against Yale University, accusing that Ivy League school of discriminating against Asian and white applicants.
Yale said it ""does not discriminate against applicants of any race or ethnicity,"" and would not change its admissions policies because of what it called the government's ""baseless"" lawsuit.

SFFA is also pursuing a similar case against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill challenging its consideration of race as a factor in its admissions process. A non-jury trial in that case began on Monday.

Islamic State claimed Wednesday's attack on a non-Muslim cemetery in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah during a World War One remembrance ceremony involving French and other embassies. The group provided no evidence for the claim.
""We will continue to hit with an iron fist against anyone who thinks of threatening our security and stability,"" Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, said in a speech carried by Saudi state news agency SPA.
Wednesday's attack occurred two weeks after a Saudi man wounded a security guard at the French consulate in Jeddah with what has been described as a ""sharp tool"" and after recent Islamist militant attacks in France and Austria.
Prince Mohammed said Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, is committed to confronting extremism, and rejects and condemns all terrorist acts.
He said actual terror attacks in the kingdom, the world's top oil exporter and a key U.S. ally, had ""fallen to near zero"" following a restructuring of the interior ministry and reforming of the security sector that began in mid-2017. 
Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne following a palace coup in 2017 that ousted the then-crown prince.
The prince also said the kingdom would continue to combat corruption after the state recovered 247 billion riyals ($65.86 billion) in settlements in addition to assets worth tens of billions of riyals in the past three years. [L1N2HY2L6]
In January 2019 Saudi Arabia ended a sweeping anti-corruption campaign in which many members of the kingdom's economic and political elite were detained.
Critics saw the crackdown as a power grab by the crown prince, who has moved to sideline any rivals to his eventual succession to the throne. Prince Mohammed has defended the campaign as ""shock therapy"" as he tries to overhaul the economy.

865,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 02:11PM ET</span>",Macron hails chance to 'make our planet great again' after Biden win,"By Matthew Green and Kate Abnett
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday welcomed the prospect of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden rejoining the Paris climate accord, saying countries now had a chance to ""make our planet great again"".
His comments follow those of other leaders who have welcomed Biden's victory as a boost to global cooperation on tackling climate change, after four years of climate policy inaction under President Donald Trump.
In contrast to Trump, who questioned climate science and withdrew the United States from the 2015 accord, Biden has pledged to rejoin the pact and to invest $2 trillion to wean the country off planet-warming fossil fuels.
Macron said having the United States rejoin the pact, after officially exiting on Nov. 4., would vindicate faith in the agreement aimed at preventing catastrophic climate change and signed by nearly 200 countries.
""It is proof that we had to stand firm against all the headwinds,"" Macron said on Thursday during an online summit hosted by the French government. 
""'Make our planet great again' is a possibility, not just in words but also in deed,"" Macron said. 
""Make America Great Again"" was a Trump election slogan. In 2017, Macron launched an initiative called ""Make our planet great again"" which offered U.S. climate scientists multi-year grants to relocate and conduct climate research in France.
Biden has pledged to convene world leaders for climate talks within his first 100 days in office. Already, climate change has been a featured topic in his first calls with U.S. allies and Pope Francis since being elected. 
However, the Democrat may face constraints on his ability to pass ambitious climate policies if the Republican Party remains in control of the Senate. 
European leaders hope a Biden administration focus on climate change will encourage other countries to pledge deeper emissions cuts ahead of a U.N. climate conference in Glasgow in November 2021.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose government is hosting the gathering, discussed climate change in a post-election call with Biden and invited him to attend.
NET ZERO PLEDGES
European Union climate chief Frans Timmermans told an online event on Monday that he hoped U.S. leadership on climate change would prompt China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, to strengthen its commitment to a low-carbon future.
Chinese President Xi Jinping in September pledged that his country would become carbon neutral by 2060. Beijing has made no official comment since the U.S. election.
Climate change was also on the agenda in calls Biden held Thursday with the leaders of Japan, South Korea and Australia, according to summaries provided by Biden's aides.
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he and Biden had ""agreed that Japan and the U.S. would work closely together to resolve pressing global issues such as the novel coronavirus and climate change"".
Japan and South Korea, big emitters of greenhouse gases from their coal-fired coal plants, both pledged in October to target net-zero emissions by 2050 in line with the Paris accord.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has faced fierce criticism from environmental campaigners on his climate record, said he and Biden spoke about emission reduction technology, but did not discuss a net-zero target. 
India, which has yet to commit to pursuing net-zero emissions, said it would welcome Washington's rejoining the Paris deal, noting that the United States has historically contributed the most to emissions accumulated in the atmosphere. 
""Therefore, they have a significant role to play in combating climate change,"" Ravi S. Prasad, additional secretary at India's environment ministry, told Reuters.
Not all national leaders were pleased with Biden's climate focus, though.
In Brazil, which has been under international pressure to halt the burning of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), President Jair Bolsonaro this week criticised Biden's call for the Latin American country to protect the rainforest with foreign help, or face unspecified ""economic consequences"".

""And how can we deal with all that? Just diplomacy is not enough,"" said Bolsonaro, who has portrayed himself as a close friend of Trump. ""When saliva runs out, one has to have gunpowder, otherwise it doesn't work.""

The camp, consisting of 23 tents with capacity for 200 people, was set up alongside an old military warehouse in Barranco Seco, the army said. 
More than 2,000 African migrants were stranded in the dockside earlier this week after a host of new arrivals over the weekend. The Interior Ministry has promised it would help provide proper shelter. 
Some migrants are currently housed in a makeshift dockside camp in the port of Arguineguin, in Gran Canaria's south. With reception centres across the islands stretched to capacity, some have been stuck on the dock for days.
Seaborne migration to the Canaries, which lie around 100 km (60 miles) off Morocco's west coast, has jumped ten-fold this year, with some 15,404 people braving the perilous Atlantic crossing, but is still far from the peak of more than 30,000 arrivals in 2006.
After 2006, when more than 30,000 people reached the shores of the Canaries, Spain stepped up security and numbers dwindled to a few hundred per year.
But heightened security in the Mediterranean combined with economic strife from the coronavirus pandemic has left more migrants attempting the Atlantic route.

Underscoring the danger of the crossing, which is usually made in rudimentary wooden fishing boats, some 140 Europe-bound migrants died after their boat caught fire and capsized off the coast of Senegal at the end of October .

The document, a request for an arrest warrant for an especially powerful former minister in Pena Nieto's 2012-2018 administration, describes the former president as running ""a state within a state"" that employed ""its own system of criminal power"" centered on distributing bribes from scandal-plagued Brazilian builder Odebrecht.
The arrest warrant request for Luis Videgaray describes more than 121 million pesos ($6 million) in bribe payments allegedly distributed to key members of Congress to ensure passage of a sweeping energy opening to private companies, according to the newspaper. 
Reforma reported it had access to the document, which concludes that Videgaray was following the then-president's orders, but added that an unnamed judge had not yet ruled on the document's legality.
The document does not request a warrant for Pena Nieto.
Reuters was not immediately able to independently confirm the authenticity of the document. Last month, Lopez Obrador confirmed that a request for a warrant for Videgaray had been made, but said it had apparently been rejected by a judge. 
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has made rooting out corruption a top priority, and has signaled his support for a referendum next year that would allow ex-presidents to stand trial.
Critics of Lopez Obrador, who lost a previous run for president to Pena Nieto in 2012, accuse him seeking to profit politically from attacking his predecessor's embrace of the energy reform that ended state-owned oil company Pemex's decades-long monopoly.
Lopez Obrador is a fierce critic of the reform.
Former Odebrecht executives have testified about bribes made to Emilio Lozoya, the former Pemex chief under Pena Nieto. Lozoya has given testimony against Videgaray and Pena Nieto in a plea deal. 
Videgaray served stints as finance and foreign minister.
Reuters could not immediately reach a representative of Pena Nieto for comment. He has in the past denied wrongdoing. Neither the attorney general's office or Videgaray immediately responded to requests for comment. 
Videgaray has previously denied wrongdoing in the case.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A helicopter with the U.S.-led Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) in the Egyptian Sinai crashed on Thursday near the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing eight members of the peacekeeper force, the MFO said.
Those killed were six Americans, a French national and a Czech national, all of them military service members, the MFO said in a statement. It added that one American MFO member survived and was medically evacuated. 
The Israeli military said it evacuated the injured peacekeeper to a hospital in Israel. 
An official briefed on the incident, and who could not be identified by name or nationality, told Reuters it was an accident caused by mechanical failure. 
The Czech Defence Ministry released a statement confirming a Czech army member was among those killed in the helicopter crash. The statement said the cause of the crash was a technical fault.
Acting U.S. Defence Secretary Christopher Miller confirmed that six Americans had been killed and said on Twitter that he was saddened by the deaths. 
The MFO was installed to monitor the demilitarization of the Sinai under the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace accord. It has decreased in size in recent years as the neighbouring countries tightened security cooperation against Islamist-led Sinai insurgents. 
However both Israel and Egypt have, in the past, opposed proposals by Washington to reduce U.S. participation in the MFO, whose website lists some 452 Americans among the force's 1,154 military personnel.
Cairo sees the MFO as part of a relationship with Israel that, while unpopular with many Egyptians, has brought it billions of dollars in U.S. defence aid, sweetening the foreign-enforced demilitarisation of its sovereign Sinai territory.
For Israel, the MFO offers strategic reassurance in a region where allegiances can shift. In a statement of condolence, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi described the MFO as ""extremely important ... to maintaining security and stability"".
The MFO statement said the helicopter was on a ""routine"" mission when it crashed. The Israeli military said in a statement it had offered to send a rescue team to the scene. 

According to its website, the MFO draws personnel from 13 countries and covers an area of more than 10,000 square kilometres (3,860 square miles) in the Sinai.

An Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement called the Ahvaz National Resistance, which seeks a separate state in Iran's oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan, claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 25 people, almost half of them members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.
Islamic State militants also claimed responsibility. Neither claim provided evidence.
""Farajollah Chaab, the leader of the separatist group, has been arrested by Iran's intelligence ministry agents,"" state TV said, without elaborating on when or how Chaab - who was based in Sweden - was arrested.
""Chaab has planned several other major attacks in Tehran and Khuzestan province in recent years...he has recently been planning to launch a new terrorist operation that failed with the efforts of the intelligence ministry agents,"" state TV said.
It broadcast on Wednesday what it described as the confessions of Chaab, a Swedish-Iranian dual national, who appeared to admit being behind the attack on the military parade in the southwestern city of Ahvaz.
State TV often airs purported confessions by suspects in politically charged cases.
""We are aware that (a) Swedish citizen has appeared in a TV programme in Iran. This is something we are addressing in our contacts with representatives of Iran,” a Swedish Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.
Iran has had tense relations with its minorities, including Arabs, Kurds, Azeris and Baluch, and has accused them of aligning with neighbouring countries rather than Tehran.
The Islamic Republic's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said at the time of the parade attack that the assailants were paid by Iran's main regional rival Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

MOSCOW/YELPIN, Armenia (Reuters) - France and the United States are expected to send diplomats to Moscow soon to discuss the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Russia said on Thursday, two days after the Kremlin deployed troops to the ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan to secure a truce.
The arrival on Tuesday of the peacekeepers to oversee the ceasefire between Azeri troops and ethnic Armenian forces in the enclave extends Russia's military footprint among the former Soviet republics it views as its strategic back yard.
Moscow co-chairs an international group overseeing the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute with Washington and Paris, but they were not involved in the deal signed by Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan to end six weeks of fighting over the enclave.
""By no means do we want to distance ourselves from our American and French colleagues,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. ""Moreover, we have invited them to Moscow. They will arrive within the next few days to discuss how they can contribute to the implementation of the achieved agreements.""
The accord, which locked in territorial gains by Azeri troops against ethnic Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh, triggered protests in Armenia calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan when it was announced early on Tuesday.
Hundreds of protesters rallied for a third day in the Armenian capital Yerevan on Thursday chanting ""Nikol is a traitor!"". They then marched to the Security Service headquarters to demand the release of some opposition leaders and activists detained on Wednesday.
Pashinyan, elected in 2018 after street protests against alleged corruption ousted the former elite, said on Thursday he had signed the accord to secure peace and save lives.
Armenians living nearer to Nagorno-Karabakh, which has reported more than 1,300 losses among its fighters, had mixed feelings but welcomed the small columns of Russian peacekeepers making their way to the enclave on Thursday.
""We are happy that peacekeepers came but at the same time we are sad that we are giving up that territory,"" Armen Manjoyan, a 45-year-old driver, said outside the Armenian village of Yelpin between Yerevan and the Azeri border.
""We all fought for it, but it turned out in vain,"" he said. ""I think it was not the right decision.""
Turkey, which has backed Azerbaijan over the conflict, signed a protocol with Russia on Wednesday to establish a joint centre to coordinate efforts to monitor the peace deal, agreed after three previous ceasefire attempts quickly broke down.
The details of the monitoring have yet to be worked out and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday that Russian officials were due in Ankara on Friday to discuss them.
Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, which now joins eight other former Soviet republics where Russia has a military presence. Moscow has military bases in five neighbouring states as well as troops in regions which have broken away from three others.

Diaz is one of 62,700 health sector workers to receive payments through an effort by Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido to channel seized offshore funds to those on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic who also struggle under the country's crippling economic crisis. 
""For what someone like me makes, that's like a million dollars. It felt like more money than I'd ever had in my life,"" said Diaz in an interview in her sister's home where she lives. 
""When it started, people laughed at us. It was terrible what they were saying on social media. But once they started depositing, we were the ones writing to them.""
In recent years, the U.S. government has imposed a series of sanctions on the socialist Venezuelan government of Maduro in an effort to dislodge him from power, accusing him of corruption, human rights violations, and rigging his 2018 re-election. Maduro denies those accusations and blames the sanctions for hurting Venezuela's economy.
The United States and dozens of other countries have recognized Guaido as the rightful head-of-state, but Maduro retains the support of the military and controls state functions.
The 'Health Heroes' program marks the first time Guaido's opposition has managed to directly transfer funds frozen by the United States as part of its sanctions.
The economic relief for health workers - who make around $5 per month - is a rare concrete victory for Guaido, who has seen his popularity wane since a euphoric opposition in 2019 helped him assume the parallel presidency.
Health Heroes taps into some $342 million held by Venezuela's central bank in offshore funds in the United States and seized under sanctions. A total of $18 million will be transferred to Venezuelan health workers, according to the opposition-run parliament.
The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, had to approve each of the recipients, said opposition legislator Manuela Bolivar. 
""We depended, in effect, on the honesty of the participant, but because it's public money we had to guarantee that the beneficiary was who they said they were,"" said Bolivar, one of the organizers of the effort, in an interview in her home.
The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Maduro has repeatedly accused Guaido and his allies of stealing funds belonging to his government. Ruling Socialist Party officials have dismissed the idea that the funds would ever reach beneficiaries.
The parliament has also set aside a further $13.6 million of the seized funds to pay themselves. They say they have not received salaries since 2016, when Maduro cut off funding to the legislature.
Francis Guillen, a nurse at a public hospital who left her job this year, used her bonus to buy a point-of-sale terminal to make it easier to process payments for homemade hair products she now sells in a market.
She said part of the second $100 payment was used to buy a blender to make cakes to sell, and has stashed the rest away to have money onhand for Christmas presents. 
""It's a drop of water in the middle of the desert,"" Guillen, seated at a living room table filled with containers of her family's home-made hair gel, said in an interview in her home in the working class neighborhood of Artigas on the west end of Caracas.

""We don't aspire to depend on Juan Guaido, nor do we aspire to depend on the government... We want a dignified salary.""

878,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 10:42AM ET</span>","War, not politics: Troubled election deepens tension in Myanmar's Rakhine","By Shoon Naing
YANGON (Reuters) - Yarzar Tun's whole family backed Myanmar's Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in the landslide 2015 election that swept her to power. As fighting this year in western Rakhine state crept closer to his home, he decided he would not vote for her again.
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) has claimed another commanding win in a parliamentary election on Sunday, the second since the end of half a century of military rule. But in Rakhine the NLD was rejected by voters such as Yarzar Tun and his family, who backed an ethnic nationalist party instead.
""When the war got worse, the MPs we elected couldn't speak out about our difficulties,"" said the 38-year-old lawyer. ""People worry every day. When will the bombs fall on them?""
While counting is still going on in many places, the NLD has won more than 80 percent of the seats so far announced, including in some ethnic minority areas.
In Rakhine, however, the party lost most of the seats it took in 2015, a result some analysts said highlighted the deepening sense of grievance many there harbour against a central government dominated by the ethnic Bamar majority that increases the risk of further conflict.
About two-thirds of the state's population were unable to vote after the election commission shut some polling stations, citing fighting between government troops and the Arakan Army (AA) insurgent group, prompting complaints that voting was only being allowed to go ahead in areas where the NLD had more support.
The election commission has denied gerrymandering and said the poll station closures were necessary for security.
Zaw Zaw Tun, secretary of the Rakhine Ethnic Congress, a humanitarian group that distributes aid to the tens of thousands displaced by the insurgency, said turnout was low, in contrast to the long lines that formed before dawn elsewhere in Myanmar.
In Rakhine, Zaw Zaw Tun said, ""people have lost trust in parties and politics, and gained interest in armed revolution"".
NLD spokesman Monywa Aung Shin blamed the violence and what he described as an ""intimidation campaign"" against ruling party candidates for their losses in Rakhine, but promised to negotiate with the nationalist candidates that won.
'SUPER-SIZED CONFLICT'
The ethnic Rakhine insurgency, believed to include thousands of rebels, poses a serious threat to Suu Kyi's government in a region already destabilised by a military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims.
More than 730,000 Rohingyas fled the army crackdown in 2017, a campaign that U.N investigators said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"". Myanmar denies accusations of genocide during what it says was a legitimate counterinsurgency campaign.
The AA, who recruit from the mostly Buddhist majority, are fighting for greater autonomy for their impoverished state. The central government has long had a weak grip in Rakhine, which borders Bangladesh and is largely separated from the rest of Myanmar by a range of jungle-clad mountains.
In 2015 most of Rakhine's seats were won by the nationalist Arakan National Party (ANP) - which strengthened its grip in Sunday's vote - but its victory largely failed to translate into political power after Suu Kyi appointed an NLD minister to oversee the region.
Suu Kyi has vowed to ""crush"" the insurgency, while the government has cut off internet access to the state.
The United Nations has accused the military of further abuses in Rakhine that it says may amount to war crimes, including arbitrary arrests, torture and deaths in custody, and extrajudicial killings.
The army denies allegations of abuses or targeting civilians and has declared the AA a terrorist organisation.
The conflict appears to have cost the NLD its base in the mostly peaceful south of Rakhine, an area with strong cultural ties to the rest of the country. 
""The fact that we won far and wide in southern Rakhine... is because the spirit of nationalism in people from those areas has become strengthened,"" said Aye Nu Sein, spokeswoman for the ANP.
Khin Maung Yi, an NLD candidate in the state capital of Sittwe, told Reuters by phone he had only won 4.8 per cent of the vote. ""The main thing is nationalism here,"" he said.
Yarzar Tun, the lawyer, lives in the southern town of Taungup, which flipped to the ANP. He said though the area had been spared the worst of the fighting, he resented the NLD lawmakers elected last time for failing to speak out against abuses.
David Mathieson, a political analyst and former Human Rights Watch researcher in Myanmar, said perceived shortcomings of the polls risked fuelling the insurgency.

""That is the real fear of these elections,"" he said. ""That their conduct could super-size support for the AA and herald years of bitter armed conflict.""

879,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>","Factbox: Peru's presidential lineup: graft probes, suicide and impeachment","By Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru, the world's No.2 copper producer and for years one of Latin America's fastest growing economies, has seen a litany of presidents ousted from office or imprisoned on allegations of corruption over the past three decades.
This week, it was the turn of centrist Martín Vizcarra, who was controversially removed from office by an opposition-dominated Congress on corruption charges, plunging the country into turmoil just five months before elections in April.
Vizcarra was not the first and is unlikely to be the last to be ousted in a country all too accustomed to political upheaval. 
Here is the rundown:
MARTÍN VIZCARRA (2018-2020)
Lawmakers ousted Vizcarra after media reports alleged he had received 2.3 million soles ($640,000) in bribes from two companies that won a public works tender while he was a regional governor years earlier.
Vizcarra, who had long clashed with lawmakers, strongly denied the allegations, but was voted out of office after a second impeachment trial in as many months found him ""morally incapable"" of governing.
PEDRO PABLO KUCZYNSKI (2016-2018)
Kuczynski remains under house arrest while prosecutors investigate him for favoring contracts with Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht while he was a minister under former President Alejandro Toledo.
Kuczynski initially denied any ties to Odebrecht. But he eventually acknowledged his consulting firm advised the builder on project financing. Kuczynski resigned from the presidency in 2018 amid pressure from Congress.
OLLANTA HUMALA (2011-2016)
Ollanta, retired from Peru's military, is under investigation for allegedly receiving $3 million from Odebrecht during the 2011 presidential election campaign. 
Prosecutors have requested 20 years in prison, but he has yet to see his day in court. Humala denies the allegations and has said he plans to run in the 2021 presidential election.
ALAN GARCÍA (1985-1990 / 2006-2011)
Former president, Alan García, committed suicide in April 2019 with a gunshot to the head when Peruvian police arrived to arrest him over allegations he participated in another Odebrecht bribery scheme.
A charismatic political leader who served two terms, García repeatedly denied the allegations of bribery. 
ALEJANDRO TOLEDO (2001-2006)
Toledo is accused of allegedly receiving a $20 million bribe from Odebrecht during his tenure. He is free on bail in the United States but faces extradition proceedings to Peru.
The former president, who has denied the allegations, spent nearly eight months in a California prison. 
VALENTÍN PANIAGUA (2000-2001)
Valentin Paniagua is the only Peruvian president in the last three decades who has not faced accusations of corruption. Paniagua led a transitional government after the resignation of former president, Alberto Fujimori.
Paniagua, who passed away in 2006, was a seasoned politician and served in Congress for several terms. 
ALBERTO FUJIMORI (1990-2000)
Fujimori is serving a 25-year sentence in prison for commanding death squads that massacred civilians in a counterinsurgency campaign during his right-wing government. He was later also found guilty of corruption in a major scandal.
Former President Kuczynski granted Fujimori a humanitarian pardon but this was rescinded by a judge during Vizcarra's term in office.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria expects to get more of its plundered Benin Bronzes back from Western museums and collectors as early as next year as global Black Lives Matter protests spur repatriation campaigns, a senior official said.
Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo state whose capital is Benin City, said discussions were underway about several returns that would be a boost for a broader movement building across Africa and beyond seeking colonial-era loot.
Plans had been drawn up to build a centre to store and study the returned artefacts by the end of 2021, and a permanent museum by 2025, Obaseki told Reuters.
""The whole Black Lives Matter movement has ... added some urgency to the conversation,"" he said.
British soldiers seized thousands of metal castings and sculptures during a raid on the then separate Kingdom of Benin in 1897.
The ""bronzes"" - actually copper alloy relief sculptures, many showing court figures - were auctioned off and then spread among institutions from New Zealand to Germany and the United States, with the biggest collection in London. 
The British Museum has long resisted calls for the full repatriation of its collection of bronzes - as well as of Ethiopia's Magdala treasures and Greece's 'Elgin marbles' - often citing legislation banning it from disposing of artefacts.
But Obaseki said worldwide anti-racism protests, which have forced Western nations to re-examine their colonial pasts, had helped advance negotiations on finding a compromise.
Several museums including the British Museum and the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna have formed a Benin Dialogue Group to discuss the sculptures and work on displaying them in a museum in Benin City, some of them officially on loan.
""FOR AFRICANS FIRST""
The British Museum said discussions were ongoing, but did not give details on timings.
""The question of the objects that will feature in the new museum in Benin and how many will be determined through discussion with our Nigerian colleagues,"" it said in a statement.
A private collector returned one item in August and four others had expressed interest in recent months in doing the same as early as next year, Obaseki said.
Funds will be raised over the next two years to build the three-storey Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA), and work on a research office to store the first returns would start in March, he said.
It would be part of an estimated $100 million regeneration scheme that would involve the excavation of the original walls and moats of Benin City, once the main hub of the Kingdom of Benin, which spanned much of what is now southern Nigeria from medieval times, until the British arrived.
An independent trust has been set up to raise funds including representatives of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments and the royal palace of the Oba, or king, of Benin.
More details will be announced on Friday, Obaseki said.
The new museum would encourage foreigners to come to Nigeria to see the bronzes, widely recognised as among the masterpieces of African art, he added.
It would try ""to make the world understand that there was a civilization in sub-Saharan Africa that compared with what was going on in Europe 400 or 500 years ago."" 
Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye, who will be overseeing the project, told Reuters it was ""ridiculous"" that Nigerians currently had to travel to Europe to see artefacts from their own culture. 

""This museum is really for Africans first,"" he said.

881,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Tigray leader says Ethiopian air strikes have killed civilians,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The leader of Ethiopia's northern Tigray region said government air strikes had killed an unspecified number of civilians in recent days and vowed to defend his people until federal authorities realise ""we cannot be subjugated by their knife"".
The week-old conflict between federal government forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a powerful ethnic faction which governs the mountainous northern region, threatens to destabilise Ethiopia and the wider Horn of Africa.
At issue is the cohesion of a country of 115 million people, where conflict among different ethnic groups has killed hundreds of people since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018.
Abiy, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, ordered the air strikes and sent troops into Tigray last week after accusing forces loyal to the Tigrayan leadership of attacking a federal military base. 
The government says the offensive will restore peace and order. Both sides say they are making advances but have not provided evidence to support their claims.
Tigray's president Debretsion Gebremichael, who is chairman of the TPLF, denied that Tigrayan troops had initiated any attacks and said they were acting in self defence, without providing evidence. 
In a telephone interview and text messages, he told Reuters that civilians had been injured and killed in air strikes in the town of Adigrat and the regional capital, Mekelle. 
""The way I see it from the prime minister, I don't think peace will come soon, because he believes that he can crush us, he believes he can do everything by his armed forces,"" Debretsion said. 
""Until he learns he will not make it, I don't think there will be peace.""
Debretsion said he could not give further details on the air strikes. Reuters was not able to independently verify his assertions on civilian casualties or determine which side initiated the attacks.
Abiy has publicly said that air strikes have hit arms depots and other military installations controlled by the TPLF. Officials in his office and the army command did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for further comment.
Journalists from Reuters and other news organisations have not been allowed to visit the base where the government says the fighting started.
Security sources and state media have said hundreds of soldiers on both sides have been killed in the fighting, but have not confirmed civilian casualties.
NEGOTIATIONS
Debretsion said talks were the only solution but that he has had no contact with Abiy since the conflict began. He said Tigrayan fighters would not strike outside the region, including in the neighbouring state of Amhara, where forces have mobilized in support of Abiy.
Abiy comes from the Oromo ethnic group, the largest in Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous nation. He took office in 2018 after decades of Tigrayan dominance of the country's multi-ethnic ruling coalition. 
Debretsion was elected chairman of the TPLF in 2017. Before that, he held senior posts in the federal government, including deputy prime minister and communications minister.
Tensions escalated in September when Tigray held a regional election in defiance of the federal government, which postponed voting nationwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tigray leaders accused Abiy of trying to illegally extend his term, which he denied, and argued the central government did not have the authority to prevent the regional election, which local officials said the TPLF won.
The government subsequently suspended federal funding to Tigray, saying the vote was illegal. Ethiopia's parliament stripped Debretsion and 38 other members of immunity from prosecution on Thursday, the state news agency reported.
Debretsion said Tigray's government lacked the resources to support its people through the crisis. Residents were struggling to work, with communications down and banks closed, and large numbers have been displaced, he said. 
He said the Tigrayan leadership had written to world leaders warning about such a conflict and that they had a responsibility to help. He did not specify which countries had been contacted and Reuters could not immediately confirm this.
""The international community has to stop and arrange peaceful negotiations to settle whatever political differences we have in this country,"" Debretsion said.
The United Nations, African Union and countries including Germany have publicly called for dialogue. 

A government spokesman said on Tuesday mediation was only possible if military hardware in Tigrayan hands was destroyed, federal officials were freed from custody, and regional leaders arrested.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 09:46AM ET</span>",Migrant smugglers see boost from U.S. pandemic border policy,"By Laura Gottesdiener and Sarah Kinosian
MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - These days, Martin Salgado’s migrant shelter in the city of San Luis Rio Colorado on Mexico’s border with the United States feels more like an hourly hotel. His guests, many of them from Central America, often don't even bother to spend the night.
Salgado said he has never seen people cycle through as repeatedly as he has in recent months, after the United States began expelling almost all migrants caught on the Mexican border rather than returning them to their homelands. Now, human smugglers often attempt to get migrants back across the border the very same day they are deported, he said.
Previously, Central American migrants apprehended at the border would be processed in the U.S. immigration system and would often be held for weeks, if not months, before being deported back to their home country.
""We never saw this before,"" said Salgado, who runs the shelter near Arizona's western limits founded by his mother in the 1990s. Some Central Americans who arrive at the shelter after being deported “eat, bathe, and suddenly they disappear."" 
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration in March announced that it would begin to quickly expel nearly all migrants caught at the border under the authority of an existing federal public health act, known as Title 42, saying the move was necessary to prevent coronavirus spreading into the United States.
But the order appears to be having unintended effects.
It’s led to an increase in repeated border crossing attempts, data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows. And it’s benefiting the illegal networks that move people from Central America to the United States, according to interviews with more than a dozen migration experts, shelter directors, immigrant advocates and human smugglers.
That is because U.S. authorities are depositing the migrants on the border, rather than returning them home, which allows smugglers to eliminate some of the costs of repeat border crossings, said three smugglers working with transnational networks. The price migrants pay smugglers, which can be $7,000, or double that, often includes two or three attempted border crossings to offset the risks of being intercepted by Mexican or U.S. authorities, according to the three smugglers, as well as migration experts.
Not all migrants travel with smugglers, but even those braving the dangerous journey alone or in small groups often turn to coyotes at the border for the final stretch of the journey. Since they too are now being returned at the Mexican border when caught they now often pay for a second or third try, in another boon for the smuggling networks, said migrant experts and a guide tied to a smuggling network in the Sonora region.
U.S. border officials say the program, which has resulted in migrants being returned in an average of less than two hours, is crucial for protecting U.S. agents, health care workers and the general public from COVID-19 by avoiding the potential spread of coronavirus if migrants were apprehended, processed, and then sent to U.S. detention centers, as per previous policy.
""It would take just a small number of individuals with COVID-19 to infect a large number of detainees and CBP personnel and potentially overwhelm local healthcare systems along the border,"" the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement.
Joe Biden clinched the U.S. presidency following the Nov. 3 election, though Trump has not acknowledged defeat and has launched an array of lawsuits to press claims of election fraud for which he has produced no evidence. The president elect has not laid out specific plans about the Title 42 program. A senior advisor to the Biden campaign in August told Reuters that Biden would look to public health officials for guidance on pandemic-related border closures.
“MAKING MORE MONEY”
Seeking safe passage on the perilous trek north, migrants often pay thousands of dollars to smugglers - known as ‘coyotes’ - linked to gangs that control territory in Mexico.
The three men who identified themselves as smugglers from different transnational networks told Reuters they save about $1,000 or more each time U.S. Border Patrol expels one of their Central American clients at the Mexican border rather than returning them back by plane to their home countries.
""It's great for us,"" said Antonio, a Salvadoran smuggler who is part of a network that he said charges migrants $14,000 a head for three runs at getting from Central America to the United States.
Antonio, like the others involved in the smuggling trade that Reuters interviewed, declined to give his last name.
He said his network spends at least $800 per migrant paying off drug cartels for the right to transit through their turf, then there are additional costs such as food, shelter, transportation, and occasional bribes to Mexican authorities.
In the past, when Central American migrants were caught by U.S. Border Patrol and sent home, his network would have to pick up that tab again on migrants' second or third attempts.
Mexico's immigration agency in August vowed to ""eradicate the collusion between public servants and human smugglers” as it ousted hundreds of officials for work-related offenses.
Pablo, a Guatemalan who ferries migrants across Guatemala's border into Mexico, estimated that the network he works for saves at least $1,300 for every Central American who is returned at the U.S. border rather than sent back to their homeland.
""We're making more money because we don't have to pay the mafia again in Mexico,"" he said. ""So, there's an advantage.""  
REPEATED ATTEMPTS
Migration numbers are returning to pre-pandemic levels, following steep declines this spring after Central American countries slammed their borders shut in an effort to halt the spread of coronavirus. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said it conducted nearly 55,000 expulsions and apprehensions of migrants at the southwest border in September. That is more than triple the figure for April and is slightly higher than the 40,507 a year earlier, according to CBP data. 
And, apprehensions and expulsions continued to climb in October, said a U.S. official with knowledge of the numbers.
Still, migration numbers for the 12-month period ended in September were down from the previous year. The Title 42 order does not change deportation policy for Mexicans, who made up about two thirds of people expelled by the United States during August and September, according to the CBP. Hondurans, Guatemalans, and Salvadorans account for the next three largest groups.
Meanwhile, the number of repeated attempts has sharply increased, indicating that fewer people are migrating than last year but more of those who are trying to cross the border multiple times.
Between April and September, the proportion of people caught crossing the border more than once surged to 37%, up from 7% for the 12-month period ended in September 2019, according to the CBP.
The president of the Border Patrol union in Laredo Texas, border agent Hector Garza, said the Title 42 order was helping limit the exposure of the border workforce to COVID-19 and avoid overwhelming local hospitals in communities in Texas, which are already experiencing a surge of coronavirus cases.
""But with any benefit there is a downside, and in this case, we're seeing people coming back and forth, trying to cross multiple times within a 24-hour period,"" he told Reuters.
In the border city of Ciudad Juarez on Oct. 31, across from the Texas city of El Paso, Cuban Alexander Garcia stood by the port of entry to the United States. Garcia, who identified himself as a doctor, said he had just been deported after his sixth attempt at crossing the border without authorization.
“They’re returning us in less than three hours!” exclaimed García. “We cross, and they just grab us and push us back into Juarez.”
U.S. Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott, during a news conference last month, said the pandemic had reduced the ability and willingness of authorities to prosecute because detaining people potentially involved additional risk of spreading COVID-19 in the United States.
“IT MOTIVATES YOU”
About 125 miles east of Salgado's shelter, Jesus, a guide linked to a local smuggling network, and his Guatemalan girlfriend, Yolanda, have been biding their time in a chilly trailer serving as a migrant stash house along the Mexican border.
They said nearby clashes between rival gangs have delayed Yolanda's departure across the Sonoran desert into the United States.
But Jesus said he's heartened by the new U.S. policy - and so are the town's smugglers that he's worked for over the years.
""It's better because if people get caught, they come right back,"" he said. ""So it's like, we're still in business.""
Yolanda was also encouraged when, upon reaching the border, she found out that if she was caught, she would only be sent to Mexico, rather than likely being deported back home.
""It motivates you,"" she said, explaining that she left Guatemala after she was forced to close her clothing shop when pandemic restrictions crippled the economy.
She racked up debts, fell behind on her mortgage, and lost her home, she said, joining a small but growing number of Central Americans fleeing the economic crisis triggered by pandemic-related restrictions across the region.
While Title 42 has encouraged some people to risk the crossing after being turned back, some human rights organizations say it erodes migrants' rights because they are being rapidly returned to Mexico before having an opportunity to explain why they fled their countries or to present a case for why they would qualify for asylum under U.S. law.

CBP said in a statement the agency ""remains committed to our obligations to provide safe haven to those who claim persecution.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission launched on Thursday a strategy for the equality of lesbian, gay, bisexual, bisexual, transgender, intersex or questioning (LGBTIQ) people in the 27-nation European Union as some countries step up anti-LGBT rhetoric.
The Commission proposed tackling discrimination against LGBT people, in particular when it comes to employment and ensuring their safety, also from online hate speech by including homophobic hate crime and hate speech in a list of Eurocrimes.
The EU executive also wants respect for LGBT rights across EU borders to make sure that different legislation in EU countries does not mean a child in a LGBT family ceases legally to be part of that family once it crosses a border.
""Everyone should feel free to be who they are – without fear or persecution. This is what Europe is about and this is what we stand for,"" said Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova.
""This first strategy at EU level will reinforce our joint efforts to ensure that everyone is treated equally,"" she said.
Hungary proposed on Tuesday a constitutional amendment that children be raised with a Christian interpretation of gender roles, as the ruling nationalists turn to anti-LGBT rhetoric to shore up support.
On Wednesday Budapest also proposed draft legislation that would practically ban adoption by same-sex couples in what rights groups said was an attack on the LGBTQ community when COVID-19 meant they could not protest.
Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, which faces elections in 2022, has increasingly turned to anti-LGBT rhetoric as the pandemic hit the economy, following the example of the ruling nationalist PiS party in Poland.
During the Polish presidential campaign earlier this year, homophobia and anti-LGBT rhetoric were the centrepiece of the PiS' and incumbent president's campaign.
According to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights 43% of LGBT people last year declared that they felt discriminated against compared to 37% in 2012, even though EU acceptance of LGBT people is growing, the Commission said. 
Last year 76% of EU citizens said lesbian, gay, and bisexual people should have equal rights to heterosexual people, the Commission said, compared to 71% in 2015.

MOSUL (Reuters) - Iraq has started closing camps housing tens of thousands of people, including many who fled their homes during the final battle against Islamic State, but aid groups warn this could create a second wave of displacement with dire consequences. 
Among those having to leave are 50-year-old Umm Ahmed and her two sons, who have lived at the Hammam al-Alil camp since 2017 when their house in Mosul was destroyed in an air strike by the U.S.-led coalition as it battled to retake the city from Islamic State. 
""I don’t have any income, no one provides for us. The camp became our home,"" said Umm Ahmed, who cannot take on manual work due to a disability. She says her sons both have mental health problems. 
Islamic State upended the lives of millions of Iraqis when they took swathes of the country in 2014 and imposed a brutal rule that in some places like Mosul would last three years.
""Before ISIS, my son used to clean the streets and we would survive with whatever income he managed to get. But now, he is too ill to work,"" said Umm Ahmed.
Hammam al-Alil, 25 kilometres (15 miles) south of Mosul, is one of several camps due to shut this month. The operation had been scheduled for earlier this year but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Khalid Abdul Karim, who heads the displacement and migration office in Mosul. 
Each family would receive 1.5 million dinars ($1,263.03) in aid during the first year and the authorities are coordinating with international aid organisations to ensure they receive assistance once they settle elsewhere, Abdul Karim said.
But aid organisations say it will be harder to reach the most vulnerable if spread across the country, and some could face violence and arrest on returning home if they have relatives who were affiliated with armed groups, including ISIS. 
Around 100,000 people are at risk of becoming homeless as the closures were not properly planned and coordinated, the Head of Support for Iraq at the humanitarian organisation Norwegian Refugee Council, Ahmad Azzam, told Reuters.
Packed up her belongings, an Iraqi woman from the province of Baji says she has no relatives to take care of her and her children. Her husband died during the war and she has been living in the camp since.
Her children, like thousands of others born under Islamic State rule, have no identification papers, without which they will struggle to access basic services, including education.
""Whether they give us support money or not depends on their conscience,"" Umm Ahmed said as she watched her neighbours load their things onto a pickup truck and set off towards an uncertain future.

Montri Yimyaem, head of the bureau, said the size of the haul pointed to a multinational network, and that Thailand would pursue it with other countries and international agencies.
""The drug is not popular in Thailand, and is mostly sold abroad, including Europe, Australia, Taiwan, Japan and Korea,"" he said.
In medicine, ketamine is used as an anaesthetic or an anti-depressant, but as a recreational drug it is used to induce dreamy or trance-like sensations, and sometimes hallucinations.
Investigators found 457 25-kg bags of the drug, worth around 29 billion baht altogether, at a warehouse in Chachoengsao province, east of Bangkok.
They had expanded their investigation after 300 kg of ketamine that had come from Thailand was found in Taiwan.
""This discovery is only the beginning, there will be further investigations to seize ill-gotten gains connected to drug smuggling,"" said Minister of Justice Somsak Thepsutin.

""I took note and await further details. We need to make progress towards signing the IFA"" (Institutional Framework Agreement) treaty, she added without elaborating.
The pact would formalise ties between non-EU member Switzerland and the 27-nation bloc now governed by a patchwork of 120 bilateral accords. 
It focuses on five areas - free movement of people, civil aviation, land transport, mutual recognition of industrial standards and processed farm goods. Switzerland would agree to take on EU single market rules in these areas.
The Swiss government said on Wednesday it was resuming talks over the treaty, which was negotiated over four years but has languished while Bern tries to forge domestic consensus on how to proceed.
The government has given no details on its stance, but said in the past it wants clarifications on state aid, EU citizens' access to Swiss welfare benefits and unilateral Swiss rules designed to protect high wages from competition by cross-border workers on temporary assignments. 
Critics say it infringes so much on Swiss sovereignty that it would never win a referendum under the Swiss system of direct democracy.
A Commission spokesman told a news briefing that von der Leyen awaited more information from the Swiss side.

""It's only once we have those details that we will be able to start looking at what the next possible steps will be. I think what's quite clear, as the president's tweet said, we need to see swift progress and the signing of this framework agreement,"" he added.

Born Mohamed Ramadan Aly, the transgender woman is one of the few in the conservative Muslim country able to confront what doctors diagnosed as gender dysphoria.
""I had a life, and I lost it completely. But I made my decision to be the person I wanted to be,"" said Aly, 50.
While the gender reassignment procedure is legal, it is a long and complicated process that is highly stigmatized.
Discrimination against LGBT+ groups is rife in Egypt, with gay and transgender people facing instances of assault and torture, according to Human Rights Watch.
The issue was brought to public attention earlier this year when a prominent Egyptian actor revealed on a TV talk show that his son was transgender, and expressed support for him. 
Aly, however, was abandoned by her family and left jobless after extended medical leave, and has had to move to a new town where only a handful of people know about her past.
""Our society will never accept my situation, or won't accept it easily. Society can accept the opposite of my situation but never my own, I have no idea why. It's just this rule engraved in their minds,"" she said.
The former teacher now tutors children in the neighbourhood to earn a living, but her dream is to one day get married and have a child.
""I had a dream that I had a girl and I raised her, brushed her hair and changed her clothes. I named her Alaa, and until this day I am referred to as Um Alaa (mother of Alaa).

""Nobody in the neighbourhood calls me by my (first) name, they call me Um Alaa,"" she said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The words the Thai king spoke to Thitiwat Tanagaroon have been tattooed on his arm: ""very brave, very good, thank you"".
The 50-year-old restaurant manager never imagined he would win praise from King Maha Vajiralongkorn when he brandished a royal portrait at an anti-government protest last month. Nor had he expected online attacks and calls for him to be fired from his job.
""There are a lot of people who still love the monarchy and worship the monarchy but they don’t come out,"" he told Reuters.
""Whoever comes out gets harassed.""
Just months ago, criticising Thailand's monarchy was taboo and few dared brave harsh royal insult laws.
Now, defending the monarchy can also draw criticism - a monumental shift in a kingdom where the institution has been promoted for decades and must be revered according to the constitution.
The Palace did not respond to a request for comment on changing attitudes since protests began in July.
""The new generation and youth, they're not into it,"" protest leader, Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree, 23, said of the deference generations of Thais have shown for the monarchy.
""They see that they're human, the king is human, not a god.""
Like many Thais his age, Thitiwat grew up watching the nightly royal news on television. He saw people kneel as royal cars passed on streets lined with royal portraits. The monarchy was the one thing he always put faith in, he said.
""It's the same love I have for my dad and mum,"" he said. ""For me, the monarchy is god.""
A decade ago, he himself joined street protests - by royalist ""yellow shirts"" - to bring down an elected populist government.
DRAMATIC CHANGE
He was among thousands who prayed and slept outside the hospital when King Bhumibol Adulyadej fell sick in 2016. And when King Bhumibol died after a seven-decade reign, Thitiwat - like the rest of Thailand - dressed in black for a year.
But Thailand has changed dramatically since protests that began in July against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha - a former army chief. 
Anti-establishment demonstrations have evolved into demands to curb the powers of the monarchy, which critics accuse of abetting military domination, taking excessive authority, lavish spending and allowing a crackdown on critics.
The protesters have emphasised that they seek to reform the monarchy not abolish it, though royalists distrust them.
For Thitiwat, all accusations against the king are lies and the monarchy stands above politics. 
His anger boiled over when chants on the street changed from vulgar expletives thrown at Prayuth to cursing the king and he fumes at the now widespread criticism of royalty on social media. 
""It makes me want to vomit,"" said Thitiwat.
The protests have drawn tens of thousands of people - including to the Pinklao suburb where Thitiwat works: a humdrum tangle of choked roads, flyovers and shopping malls.
""Half the people support the protesters and half are against,"" said Gade, 50, who supports the demonstrations and has a clothes stall 100 metres from Thitiwat's restaurant.
On the day Thitiwat stood nearby with his picture of the late king, there was no confrontation, the royalist said. Protesters just raised their emblem of defiance, the three-finger ""Hunger Games"" salute.
But online, he said was branded ""disgusting"" and much worse. The restaurant's rating was knocked from 4.8 stars to 1 and it was bombarded with calls to fire him, its owner said.
""I was very scared,"" said owner Bo, 33, who did not want to give her full name or have her restaurant identified.
On Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), one user called Mind Pain wrote ""I'm disappointed, time to find a new place to eat."" However, the owner said royalists were now coming in solidarity and takings had risen.
While royalists condemn such attacks, protesters complain of worse.
""Think about what the pro-democracy side endured in recent years. Prosecuted, followed, harassed, put into choke holds,"" Tattep said. ""There has to be dialogue, not harassment.""
SENTIMENT SHIFT
Gauging the shift in the country of 70 million is hard. The biggest protests have been bigger than royalist shows of support, but one recent poll said 60% of people thought the protesters should not attack the monarchy - though without explaining why.
Change is evident. Not everyone stands for the royal anthem in cinemas any more. When a woman slapped a teenager who didn't stand for the national anthem at a railway station, it was she who faced public condemnation.
Thitiwat's emergence as a hero for monarchists came when the king praised him outside the palace on the evening of Oct. 23 as he knelt with thousands of other well-wishers.
Thitiwat said the encounter was not staged, as critics have suggested. He burst into tears of emotion and later couldn't sleep. The video he posted of the meeting went viral.
But many were not sympathetic. They accused the king of stoking division by praising Thitiwat while ignoring protest demands. A week later, the king said protesters were ""loved all the same"", but there has been no royal response to their demands.
Some radical monarchists say they are ready for violence, but Thitiwat saw no place for that.

""The kids are like family,"" he said. ""I'll try to be tougher and endure the hatred.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said on Thursday that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden wanted Britain to reach a Brexit trade deal with the European Union, so Prime Minister Boris Johnson should knuckle down.
Biden's win in the U.S. presidential election has changed the international context of Brexit: U.S. President Donald Trump backed Britain's decision to leave the EU, while Biden served as vice president under Barack Obama, who advised against it.
Biden, who is proud of his Irish heritage, has repeatedly said the U.S.-brokered 1998 ""Good Friday"" peace deal for Northern Ireland must not be undermined. That has been seen as a warning against a bill proposed by Johnson that would negate parts of Britain's EU divorce agreement governing the UK-Ireland border.
Biden repeated his support for the Good Friday agreement in a phone call with Johnson on Tuesday. The president-elect has said that if Britain undermines it, London will not be able to obtain a trade deal with the United States.
""He is very committed to the Good Friday Agreement,"" Martin said of Biden. ""Particularly in relation to Brexit, he would favour obviously a deal between the European Union and Britain.""
""And I think that's where, if I could respectfully say it, that's where the British government should head, in that direction, in my view. It should knuckle down and... get a deal with the European Union,"" Martin told BBC radio.
The United Kingdom left the EU in January. The two sides are trying to clinch a deal that would govern trade once a status quo transition period ends on Dec. 31. Many businesses say an exit without a deal would cause chaos.
BIDEN AND BREXIT
But the clock is ticking: the talks are now likely to go beyond yet another Brexit deadline - this time Nov. 15 - though negotiators are racing to clinch a deal with enough to ratify it before the end of the year.
Martin said Johnson's Internal Market Bill, which London has acknowledged could violate international law by overturning parts of the Brexit divorce agreement on Northern Ireland, had raised concerns about how far the EU could trust him.
Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said Britain would not compromise on its sovereignty but that the government hoped for a deal in the days ahead.

""We hope that in the days ahead, admittedly, time is short, but in the days ahead, both sides will be able to reach agreement and the EU will show some further flexibility in those respects,"" he told the BBC.

Russia has brokered a ceasefire that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, where Azeri troops have been battling ethnic Armenian forces over the past six weeks.
The accord, which also envisages the stationing of Russian peacekeeping troops in Nagorno-Karabakh has triggered protests in Armenia for the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.
Moscow co-chairs an international group overseeing the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute with Washington and Paris, but the latter were not involved in the ceasefire deal, which was signed between Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Turkey, which has backed Azerbaijan over the conflict, signed a protocol with Russia on Wednesday to establish a joint centre to coordinate efforts to monitor the peace deal, agreed after three previous ceasefire attempts quickly broke down.
The details of the monitoring have yet to be worked out and Turkish and Russian officials are due to meet in Ankara on Friday to discuss them.

The arrest of Chin'ono and dozens of activists in the last four months has led to accusations that the government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa is persecuting the opposition, a charge the authorities deny.
Chin'ono, who uses social media posts to criticise the government, was first arrested in July on charges of inciting violent anti-government protests.
After his latest arrest, he was charged with contempt of court but prosecutors dropped those charges. He is now accused of attempting to ""defeat the course of justice"" after he posted comments on Twitter about the National Prosecuting Authority.
Chin'ono has denied the latest charges, saying he is being persecuted for exposing corruption in government.
Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa ruled that Chin'ono should stay in prison custody while awaiting trial because ""the accused person has a propensity to commit offences"".
Doug Coltart, one of Chin'ono's lawyers, said an appeal against the ruling would be made at the High Court.
Chin'ono was first detained for more than a month at a maximum-security prison until his release on bail on Sept. 2. The embassies of the United States and Britain have criticised the arrest of Chin'ono.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Muslima Abdirahman, a Somali mother of nine, escaped death twice in the past two years while shopping for groceries in Mogadishu, where Islamist insurgents regularly carry out suicide bombings on busy streets and markets. 
She shudders at the memories: ""I wiped my tears with my veil and went home on foot without buying anything.""
But earlier this year Abdirahman traded her dangerous errands for online shopping, thanks to the World Food Programme's ""humanitarian e-commerce"" system in Somalia -- part of its global shift from distributing food to handing out cash. 
Conceived as a way to protect women in Somalia from security threats -- be it bombings in the capital city or harassment in a camp -- it is also now helping to prevent large crowds gathering at aid distribution sites during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Abdirahman compares the prices of products such as cooking oil and salt offered by retailers on an app called e-Shop created by WFP, spending the monthly $60 stipend she receives from the agency as she sees fit. This frees up time for working as a cleaner and for childcare, she said. 
Her neighbour Ilhan Adow, who also uses the WFP app, says she uses the hours she saves to breastfeed her children, do chores and rest. 
WFP launched e-Shop in 2018 but only introduced home delivery in April this year, a month after COVID-19 reached Somalia. WFP sped up implementation of this option so that needy families could reduce their potential exposure to the virus, said Cesar Arroyo, head of WFP in the country.
DIGNITY
Years of conflict, and the threat of al Qaeda-linked Islamists battling to overthrow the government, leave many Somalis dependent on aid. 
But e-Shop has changed the dynamic, said Arroyo.
""Years ago, when we were handing out food, people accepted it but you could see in their body language how the dignity wasn’t there,"" he said. ""Now... they are the ones deciding where and what to buy.""
Hundreds of retailers sell on the app. Transactions are recorded to comply with the government tax system. Purchases are verified on delivery using biometrics.
Six million dollars in transactions, and more than 51,000 deliveries, have gone through the system. 
It operates in Mogadishu, including in camps for people forced from their homes by violence, and in all Somalia's main towns. 
WFP has long used electronic vouchers for distributing cash aid for Syrian refugees, but Somalia is the first place where it has used an app and home delivery system.
The U.N. agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize this year, hopes to roll out online shopping elsewhere, said Arroyo. ""If it works in Somalia it can work anywhere else."" 
Nearly 100,000 out of the 500,000 people receiving cash aid monthly from the United Nations in Somalia are using e-Shop. The number of app users has doubled, from 47,000 at the end of March, before home delivery launched, to 94,000 by late October.
Abdirahman said COVID-19 was yet another reason she preferred shopping online. ""We were afraid of catching corona,"" she said. ""We were lucky to get this application.""
One businessman said his sales have increased by 80% since his company began selling food on the app, now that people living in camps on the outskirts of Mogadishu can access his products via the app. 

""They used to come a long way to our shops,"" said Ahmed Nur Abdullahi Siyad. ""Now they don't have to pay bus fare.""

U.S. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to be tougher on Turkey than was Donald Trump, particularly over its foreign and defence policies, and domestic human rights record. 
Biden could back U.S. congressional efforts to sanction Ankara over its purchase of the Russian S-400s missiles.
Ties between NATO allies were badly strained last year when Ankara acquired of the advanced air-defense system, prompting Washington to remove Turkey from its F-35 jet program.
Washington says use of S-400 systems could compromise NATO defenses. Turkey says the S-400s would not be integrated into NATO systems and would not pose a threat. Ankara has repeatedly complained that a U.S. refusal to sell it Patriot missiles led it to seek other sellers.
""We are ready to address the U.S. concerns over the compatibility of the S-400s and F-35s,"" Akar said.
""The safety of the F-35 technology is as important for Turkey as it is for the United States,"" he said, adding the joint working group proposal was still on the table. 

Akar said Ankara continued the preparations and tests of the S-400 systems, which he said ""will be used the same way as the (Russian) S-300 system is used by some other members of the NATO alliance.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Fouad Boulos returned to Beirut in 2007 from the United States having trained there in pathology and laboratory medicine. He was so confident that Lebanon was the right place to be that he gave up his American residence green card.
Fourteen years later he is leaving his homeland with his wife and five children and returning to the United States to try his luck starting from scratch.
In the past year, Lebanon has been through a popular uprising against its political leaders, the bankruptcy of the state and banking system, a COVID-19 pandemic and, in August, a huge explosion at the port that destroyed swathes of Beirut.
Some of those who can leave the country have done so, and an increasing number of them are doctors and surgeons, many at the top of their profession. With them goes Beirut's proud reputation as the medical capital of the Middle East.
""This is a mass exodus,"" said Boulos, Associate Professor of Clinical Pathology and Laboratory (NYSE:LH) Medicine at the American University of Beirut (AUB).
""It will keep on going,"" he told Reuters. ""If I had hope I would have stayed but I have no hope - not in the near nor in the intermediate future - for Lebanon.""
As he spoke at his mountain residence in Beit Mery, a forested area with sweeping views over Beirut, his wife helped pack up their last possessions, ready to return to the United States.
Suitcases lined the hallway, and one of his daughters was online saying final farewells to school friends and her teacher.
""It breaks my heart. It was the hardest decision I ever had to make, leaving everything behind,"" Boulos added.
Many highly qualified physicians, who were in demand across the United States and Europe before they returned to Lebanon after the 1975-90 civil war, are throwing in the towel, having lost hope in its future.
They are not only seeing wages fall, but also face shortages of equipment, staff and even some basic supplies in their hospitals as Lebanon runs out of hard currency to pay for imports.
BLEEDING TALENT
Sharaf Abou Sharaf, head of the doctors' syndicate, said the departure of 400 doctors so far this year creates a major problem, especially for university hospitals where they both practise and teach.
""This bleeding of talent does not bode well, especially if the situation lasts long and there are others who are preparing to leave,"" he said.
Caretaker Health Minister Hamad Hassan agreed.
""Their expertise was built over many years and is very hard to lose overnight. We will need many years to return the medical sector to its former glory,"" he told Reuters.
Protests that erupted last year and brought down the government had raised hopes that politicians, selected by a system in which leaders of Christian and Muslim sects shared the top jobs, could be pushed aside.
Then came the Aug. 4 blast, when large amounts of poorly stored ammonium nitrate exploded, killing 200 people, injuring 6,000, making 300,000 people homeless and destroying large parts of the capital Beirut including several hospitals.
""The explosion was the final nail in the coffin,"" Boulos said.
""It crystallised all the fears, all the pain and all the difficulties that we were living through,"" added the medic, who trained at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.
'CORRUPT TO THE CORE'
Boulos said he had lost faith in the country's leadership, after years of instability caused by political bickering.
""Lebanon is corrupt to the core,"" he said, echoing the chants of thousands of protesters who packed city streets during the last year.
The country has also had to deal with the influx of more than a million Syrians fleeing civil war, an economy that has buckled under the weight of debt, mass unemployment, poverty, and, more recently, the coronavirus pandemic.
On Tuesday, Lebanon ordered a nationwide lockdown for around two weeks to stem the spread of the virus, as intensive care units reached critical capacity.
Hassan, the caretaker health minister, has said an agreement was reached with the central bank to allocate funds for private hospitals to set up COVID-19 wings and that the state would pay hospital dues for the first six months of 2020.
The government had for years owed hospitals arrears and their unpaid bills are mounting.
Ghazi Zaatari, Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs and Chair of the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine at AUB, said he feared the exodus would accelerate.
""For the past 10 years we put a lot of effort into recruiting around 220 faculty members, and now it is very disheartening to see that many of those we hired are leaving again.""
Doctors in Lebanon, although relatively well paid, generally earn less than they did abroad.
Over the past year they have seen real incomes drop due to the 80% devaluation in the currency.
The caretaker health minister said the state was seeking international help to prop up depreciated salaries of doctors to slow the exodus.
But both Boulos and Zaatari said money was not the main problem.
""Money is an issue, but this lack of trust and confidence in the political leadership (for) a safe, secure and successful future is a huge factor,"" Zaatari said.

""I am one of those who came back in the mid-90s believing that there was a promise of a better future and a reconstruction plan, only to find that 20 years later everything is collapsing and the promises were false promises. We were robbed big time.""

HANOI (Reuters) - Southeast Asian leaders kicked off a multilateral summit on Thursday expected to address tensions in the South China Sea and tackle plans for a post-pandemic economic recovery in a region where U.S.-China rivalry has been rising.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has so far not been ""drawn into the maelstroms"" of those rivalries and challenges to the international multilateral system, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in his opening remarks at the 37th ASEAN Summit in Hanoi.
""Three quarters of a century have passed since the end of the Second World War. World peace and security, however, are not yet truly sustainable,"" said Phuc, whose government holds the chairmanship of the 10-member bloc.
""This year, they are particularly under greater threat as a result of compounding risks arising from the unpredictable conduct of states, major power rivalries and frictions,"" Phuc said at the virtual summit, which also includes meetings between ASEAN and China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and the United States.
High on the summit's agenda will be tensions in the South China Sea, where Chinese ships have been embroiled in periodic standoffs with vessels from Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia as Beijing seeks to assert its territorial claims in the disputed waterway.
China claims about 80% of the sea including large swathes of Vietnam's exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, as well as the Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands. It also overlaps the EEZs of ASEAN members Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
Since mid-August, the United States has repeatedly riled China by sending warships to the South China Sea and has blacklisted 24 Chinese entities over their involvement in building and militarising artificial islands.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged Beijing would ""continue to work with ASEAN countries on the path of peaceful development to uphold peace and stability in the region"". 
Describing the coronavirus pandemic as the ""defining challenge of our generation"", Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte urged countries to ""work together to ensure that all nations – rich or poor – will have access to safe vaccines"". 
ASEAN leaders are also expected to sign the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) on Sunday in what could become the world's biggest trade agreement.

The deal, which comes at a time when tensions over the U.S. election result leave questions over Washington's engagement in the region, will likely cement China's position more firmly as an economic partner with Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea, and put it in a better position to shape the region's trade rules.

The report, based on research conducted between September 2019 and November 2020, alleges that security contractors and security employees of Petra's subsidiary Williamson Diamonds Limited (WDL) used excessive force against unarmed Tanzanians.
""We have found evidence indicating that since Petra Diamonds acquired the Williamson Mine in 2009, there have been at least seven killings and 41 assaults of local residents, many leading to life-changing injuries,"" RAID said. 
""The Board of Petra Diamonds finds the allegations of human rights abuses at the Williamson mine in Tanzania to be deeply concerning and is taking the matter extremely seriously,"" said Petra Diamonds, who owns 75% of WDL. Tanzania owns the remaining stake.
An investigation is being carried out by a specialist external adviser, Petra Diamonds said, adding that it has appointed an external consultancy to assess WDL's management of its security.
WDL has suspended the mine chief security officer and the support services manager, an interim measure taken ""whether or not there is any substance in the allegations"", Petra CEO Richard Duffy said in a letter to RAID dated Oct. 13.
Professor Simon Msanjila, a permanent secretary at Tanzania's Ministry of Minerals, said he cannot comment on the report as yet.
Zenith Security Services Ltd, the security contractor named in the report, did not respond to a Reuters request via email for comment. 
The allegations highlight the tensions caused when mining companies co-exist with communities, who rely on subsistence mining to supplement their income, as in other parts of Tanzania and across resource-rich countries in Africa.
Subsistence or ""artisanal"" miners, who typically use rudimentary techniques, number around 40 million worldwide, according to a 2019 estimate by Delve, an artisanal mining database.
Separately, UK-based law firm Leigh Day filed a claim in the High Court of England and Wales on Sept. 9 on behalf of more than 30 Tanzanians, who alleged 'abuse of human rights' at the Williamson mine.
The claims have not yet been served on either Petra or WDL.
The Williamson mine, which has been active since 1940, is located in Shinyanga - one of the poorest regions of Tanzania. A 54.5-carat pink diamond presented to Queen Elizabeth for her wedding in 1947 came from Williamson. 
The mine has been shut since April, when Petra - which also operates diamond mines in South Africa - put it on ""care and maintenance"" after the coronavirus pandemic caused rough diamond prices to plunge.

Fortunately for him, after spells of panic-buying in Britain and the sight of empty supermarket shelves, many consumers are buying several turkeys to make sure they have one for Christmas.
""[This year] started off being business as usual because we aren't used to selling anything until Christmas time anyway,"" said Copas, surrounded by gobbling birds.
""But bringing our seasonal team over to work and process the turkeys has been more challenging because of the uncertainty of travel and travel arrangements being cancelled.""
Copas, whose family has worked the farm west of London since 1901, said 2020 had proved tough as they had had no idea of the looming health crisis when they ordered young birds to rear.
""We have 10 to 12 different breeds of turkey which we have to get to the right weight by Christmas. But we have to order those by February. Before COVID happened we already had the turkeys on the way, if not actually on the ground on the farm. We've had to work with what we've got and based on previous years orders.""
People seem to be ordering Christmas turkeys as they did last year, he said, despite the uncertainty over what kind of celebrations will be allowed and with what restrictions. 
""In fact, people are ordering more or getting additional turkeys like frozen turkeys to make sure they've got one for Christmas,"" he said.
A five-kilo, free-range, whole bronze turkey from Copas Traditional Turkeys costs 88 pounds ($116).
""Although there is more demand for the smaller products people are also quite happy to buy the bigger products.""

BELIZE CITY (Reuters) - Belize is expected to announce the results of its general election on Thursday as longtime Prime Minister Dean Barrow steps down and the small Central American nation seeks to repair an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Barrow ran Belize for more than a dozen years, and his conservative United Democratic Party (UDP) is now in the hands of Patrick Faber.
Seeking a fourth consecutive term for the party, Faber faces a tough contest against challenger Johnny Briceno, a former deputy prime minister of the center-left People's United Party (PUP), a longtime rival.
The election comes amid widespread discontent over an economy that was in the doldrums long before measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus decimated tourism, the main driver of prosperity. 
""The issues that drive me to vote are the economy, the integrity of our government institutions, and a long-term plan for the country's development,"" said Jose Alpuche, 40, an attorney. 
The polls closed at 6 p.m. local time Wednesday and results will roll in overnight, with an announcement of the winner expected on Thursday. Reliable polls are few and far between in the former British colony, making the outcome of the vote hard to predict.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Gates Foundation added another $70 million of funding on Thursday to global efforts to develop and distribute vaccines and treatments against the COVID-19 pandemic, saying it hoped other international donors would now also pledge more.
An extra $50 million will go to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) led by the GAVI vaccine alliance, the foundation said, and another $20 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) which is co-funding development of several COVID-19 vaccine candidates.
""We have to ensure that everyone gets equal access to tests, drugs, and vaccines when they are available - no matter where you live in the world,"" the foundation's co-chair Melinda Gates said in a statement. ""Our pledge today... means we are getting closer to having the resources needed to help the world fight this virus."" 
Along with the World Health Organization, CEPI and GAVI are co-leading a global scheme known as the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator which aims to speed up development, production and fair access to COVID-19 drugs, tests and vaccines.
GAVI has said the COVAX facility, which is part of the scheme, aims to have secured 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021. It says doses will be made available to people in all COVAX participating countries, with almost a billion doses available to the 92 poorest countries through the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC).
Preliminary positive data this week from trials of two potential COVID-19 shots - one from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNtech and one developed in Russia - are encouraging signs that the first vaccines against the pandemic disease may be ready to be deployed before the end of 2020.
Mark Suzman, the Gates Foundation's chief executive officer, told reporters in an online briefing that this was ""an auspicious week"" to be adding to global funding efforts.
The vaccine news ""makes us hopeful about a number of the other vaccine products in the pipeline,"" he said. ""But there's still a long way to go between that and getting vaccines approved (by regulators), and then into people who need them at the scale and with the kind of equitable global distribution we really need to bring the virus under control.""
The Gates Foundation began pledging funds for the vaccines AMC in June, and the extra $50 million brings its total pledges to $156 million. The new funds will also unlock an extra 12.5 million pounds ($16.5 mln) from Britain, which had promised to part-match other contributions.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday ordered government agencies to rush aid to people affected by Typhoon Vamco, after the storm killed at least two people and brought the worst flooding in the capital Manila in years.
Tens of thousands of homes in low-lying suburbs were submerged by the floods, prompting residents to scramble onto rooftops awaiting rescue.
Vamco, the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, battered a nation still reeling from Goni, the world's most powerful typhoon this year that killed 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes early in November.
""Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind,"" Duterte said in a national address, pledging shelter, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counselling.
The latest typhoon, which has also left four missing, comes as the Philippines is still grappling with a wave of COVID-19 infections and a battered economy.
In some suburbs east of Manila residents took refuge on their flooded homes.
""Just a few steps remaining on our third floor and we have yet to see any rescuer,"" Carla Mhaye Suico, a resident in Pasig City, told DZBB radio, while sheltering with 15 family members and neighbours.
Roughly 40,000 homes had been either fully or partially submerged in Marikina City, its mayor, Marcelino Teodoro, told DZMM radio station, calling the situation ""overwhelming"" and the worst since a typhoon flooded large swathes of Manila in 2009.
""The local government cannot handle this,"" Teodoro said, requesting motorised boats and airlifts.
Nearly three million households in and around Manila were without power as people waded through waist-high floods, carrying valuables and pets.
Coast guards had to swim in flood waters as high as electricity poles, while rescue workers used rubber boats and makeshift floats to carry children and the elderly to safety.
Big waves and strong winds in Manila Bay budged a tanker, damaging a bridge.
Flights and mass transit in Manila were suspended while the coast guard stopped port operations. Government work was suspended and financial markets were shut.
Vamco has now weakened, with sustained winds of 130 kilometres (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), after exiting Luzon island, home to half of the Philippines' 108 million people.
The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, experiences around 20 tropical storms a year that often continue on their track to hit Vietnam, China and Taiwan.

Vamco is forecast to head towards Vietnam. Floods and mudslides over the past month have killed at least 160 people in central Vietnam, left dozens missing and damaged 390,000 houses.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's opposition staged a final show of defiance in the legislature on Thursday before resigning to protest against the dismissal of four of their colleagues in what they see as another bid by Beijing to suppress democracy in the city.
The withdrawal of the opposition from the city legislature will mean an end for what has been one of the few forums for dissent after Beijing's imposition of national security legislation in June and coronavirus restrictions ended pro-democracy protests that began last year.
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed government expelled four opposition members from the legislature on Wednesday for endangering national security after China's parliament gave city authorities new powers to curb dissent.
The remaining 15 opposition members of the 70-seat Legislative Council, known as Legco, then said they would quit in a solidarity with their colleagues.
""I suppose this is my last protest in Legco,"" opposition member Lam Cheuk-ting said after unfurling a protest banner vilifying the city's leader, Carrie Lam.
The opposition politician had briefly displayed the banner from the building's second floor, with the message: ""Carrie Lam is corrupting Hong Kong and hurting its people; She will stink for 10,000 years.""
The city's chief executive was not in the assembly at the time.
On Wednesday, Carrie Lam defended the expulsion of the four opposition members as being in accordance with the law and she dismissed suggestions the legislature would become a rubber stamp.
Opposition members have tried to make a stand against what many people in the former British colony see as Beijing's whittling away of freedoms, despite a promise of a high degree of autonomy under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, agreed when it returned to China in 1997.
China denies curbing rights and freedoms in the global financial hub but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved decisively to stifle dissent after anti-government protests flared last year and plunged the city into crisis.
'CHAOS AGAIN'
While the legislators campaigned for democracy in the assembly, a younger generation of democracy supporters took their demands to the streets in months of sometimes violent protests.
""I never thought highly of the democrats,"" student Jasmine Yuen, 21, said of the opposition politicians, as she walked to classes. ""But now that they've resigned we don't even have anyone on our side with voting rights in Legco.""
China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office condemned the resignations as ""a blatant challenge to the central government's authority"".
""We would like to warn these opposition members that if they want to use this to encourage radical resistance and beg for intervention from outside forces to drag Hong Kong into chaos again, that is a wrong calculation,"" the office said in a statement.
The disqualifications and opposition walk-out are likely to add to concern in the West about Hong Kong's autonomy as Joe Biden prepares to take over from Donald Trump as U.S. president, promising to promote democracy around the world.
U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the disqualifications showed the Chinese Communist Party had ""flagrantly violated its international commitments"" and was ""expanding one party dictatorship in Hong Kong"".
Britain's foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said the expulsions constituted an assault on Hong Kong's freedoms.
Germany, holder of the European Union's rotating presidency, and Australia also condemned the oustings.
The Chinese parliament cleared the way for the disqualifications with the passing of a resolution allowing Hong Kong to expel legislators deemed a threat to security or not holding allegiance to Hong Kong.
Chinese state media hailed its parliament's resolution as a ""long overdue"" step towards ""the return of peace and prosperity"" in Hong Kong. It also stressed the need for the city to be ""governed by patriots"".
The fate of Hong Kong's political opposition has been in doubt since the government, citing coronavirus risks, postponed September's legislative elections by a year. Critics saw that as a bid to kill the pro-democracy camp's momentum.

""The city is dying. It has been dying for some time. Now we’re even more like China,"" said student Calvin Fan.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - After his 92-year-old grandmother started coughing and her blood oxygen levels plummeted, Varunn Kaushik took her to two top private hospitals in New Delhi on Monday. Neither took her in, even after one of them found her positive for COVID-19.
Kaushik said several other hospitals told him and his family on the phone that they did have free beds, but not in the intensive care units (ICU) his grandmother needed. He finally admitted her to a non-ICU COVID bed in a government hospital, 10 hours after leaving home.
Her condition was stable as of Thursday, according to Kaushik.
The family's ordeal is a warning sign for a city where infections are surging even though they are dropping elsewhere in the country.
Delhi's 20 million residents celebrate their biggest festival, Deepavali or Diwali, this weekend. Despite a ban, thousands of fireworks are likely to be set off, increasing already bad air pollution and raising the risk posed by COVID-19.
The capital reported 8,593 new COVID-19 infections on Wednesday, its highest daily tally yet. The average pollution reading was 299 on Thursday on a scale of 500, where any number above 300 is classified as very poor and can cause respiratory illnesses. 
(For graphic on COVID-19 cases in major Indian cities : https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/INDIA/azgpojwjxvd/chart.png)
ICU facilities in the city are in such short supply that some hospitals are squeezing more beds into existing wards ahead of the weekend.
""We are firefighting because Diwali is looking like a super spreader event in front of us and the public just doesn't see the threat,"" said a senior health department official in Delhi, declining to be named.
New Delhi's sprawling bazaars have been swarming with shoppers ahead of Diwali and the wedding season after the government relaxed regulations in a bid to breathe life into the lockdown-hit economy. Mask-wearing is common but social distancing is not, and infections may spike in coming days.
The city was one of the first in the country to restart economic activity after the lockdown that started in March, letting restaurants, malls and other businesses restart to avoid spiralling joblessness.
MORE BEDS
India has so far reported around 8.6 million coronavirus infections - the world's second highest after the United States - and 127,571 deaths. But overall, it has been adding fewer cases daily since a mid-September peak, and its fatality figure of 92 per million people is well below the world's tally of 160 and the United States' 711.
Still, the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research says the recent fall in cases nationally could be undone if there is a resurgence in infections around Diwali.
Federal authorities have asked the local government in the capital to prepare resources to handle as many as 15,000 cases a day and test more aggressively.
Over half of the city's 16,511 COVID hospital beds were occupied as of Wednesday, government data showed, with more than 24,000 other patients isolating at home. There is no separate data for ICU beds.
Delhi's government said hundreds of more beds have been reserved for COVID-19 patients in nearly two dozen private and government hospitals. More than 100 ICU beds are also being added in government setups.
""Most of the cases are coming from working class people, those aged between 20 and 50, those who are very active,"" Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told Reuters partner ANI, indicating these victims may not need critical care.
He did not respond to e-mailed questions from Reuters.
All ICU beds at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, one of the top private hospitals in the city, are now occupied, said Dhiren Gupta, a senior pulmonologist.
In government-run Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, doctors have packed beds into ICU wards to the closest permissible limit.
""We have increased the number of beds but there are limitations of distancing and ventilation,"" said Desh Deepak, a senior pulmonologist. ""We're operating at almost full capacity in ICUs.""
The experience of Kaushik's grandmother has left him worried about himself and the rest of his family, as they wait to get tested for the coronavirus themselves.

""God forbid, if anyone else needs hospitalisation ... what would happen two days down the line?"" he said. ""That is even more scary.""

SEOUL/TOKYO/WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - In their first calls with Joe Biden since the U.S. election, the leaders of Japan, South Korea and Australia on Thursday reaffirmed plans to form close ties with the president-elect to tackle issues including climate change and regional security. 
The three key Asian allies - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison - join other global leaders in recognizing the Democratic challenger's Nov. 3 victory over incumbent Donald Trump, who has so far refused to concede.
Biden's projected win comes against a backdrop of China's growing military and economic assertiveness in the region, and after years of sometimes tumultuous relations between Asian allies and the United States under Trump over issues including trade, defence and the environment. 
All sides expressed their determination to strengthen bilateral ties as well as tackle global issues such as the coronavirus pandemic and climate change, Biden's office said.
Japan's Suga said he spoke with Biden by telephone and confirmed the importance of bilateral ties.
""President-elect Biden said that he looks forward to strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance and working together on achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Suga said to reporters, in separate comments made at the Prime Minister's Office.
Biden had earlier spoken to the leaders of Germany, the UK, Canada and France, but China and Russia have so far held off passing on their congratulations and speaking with the President-elect. 
SECURITY AND PROSPERITY
Biden on Wednesday named Ron Klain as his White House chief of staff, his first major appointment as he builds his administration. Anthony Blinken, a diplomat and longtime confidant of Biden is seen as a likely pick for Secretary of State or National Security Adviser, both key roles for Asian allies.
Speaking to South Korea's Moon, Biden reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to defend South Korea, highlighting the Asian ally as a ""lynchpin of the security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region,"" Moon's spokesman Kang Min-seok said.
""President Moon asked for close cooperation for the forward-looking development of the bilateral alliance, and the denuclearisation and peace on the Korean peninsula,"" Kang told a briefing. ""President-elect Biden said he would closely cooperate to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.""
Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to work towards denuclearisation at their unprecedented summit in 2018, but little progress has been made since their second summit and working-level talks collapsed last year.
While Biden has said he would not meet with Kim without preconditions, he has also said he would embrace ""principled diplomacy"" with North Korea.
South Korean officials are also hopeful that Biden will quickly resolve a drawn-out, multi-billion dollar dispute with Washington over the cost of thousands of U.S. troops on the peninsula.
Tackling the global coronavirus pandemic and climate change were key themes in Biden's calls with all three leaders, readouts from Biden's office showed.
Australia's Morrison said he spoke with Biden about emission reduction technology, though a target for zero net emissions by 2050 was not discussed. 
""I raised with the president-elect the similarity between the president-elect's comments and policies regarding emissions reduction technologies that we needed to achieve that, and we look forward to working on those issues,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. 
Both Moon and Suga said they agreed to arrange summits with the new president shortly after his inauguration in January.

Biden will also face the challenge of managing unresolved political and economic disputes between South Korea and Japan, which have threatened a military intelligence-sharing arrangement and complicated U.S. efforts to counter China.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will appoint a special investigator to determine whether to prosecute members of the country's military for alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday. 
Australia in 2016 launched an inquiry into the conduct of its special forces personnel between 2005 and 2016 amid allegations by local media about the killing of unarmed men and children. 
While Morrison did not reveal details of the report, which is set to be released next week, he said it will contain ""difficult and hard news for Australians"".
""Given the likely allegations of serious and possibly criminal misconduct, the matters raised in the inquiry must be assessed, investigated and, where allegations are substantiated, prosecuted in court,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
Morrison said the special investigator was needed as the probe into the actions of some of Australia's military in Afghanistan was so complex that it would overwhelm and distract the country's normal criminal prosecutor.
The special prosecutor will be assisted by experienced investigators, legal counsel and other support personnel, Morrison said.
Australia is a staunch U.S. ally and has had troops in Afghanistan since 2002.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",Long-term ally of UK PM Johnson resigns in sign of tension,"By Elizabeth Piper and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson's director of communications resigned on Wednesday, a move that suggested tension at the heart of government as Britain prepares to complete its Brexit journey out of the European Union.
Lee Cain has been a loyal ally of the prime minister, working for him since he was foreign minister until 2018 and staying by his side, sometimes without pay, when Johnson resigned over predecessor Theresa May's Brexit plans.
Cain is also close to Johnson's senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, after working with him in the Vote Leave campaign to quit the EU, a partnership that was reborn in Downing Street when the Conservatives won a big election victory last year. 
But sources have suggested there has been tension in Johnson's No. 10 Downing Street office since the government's communications strategy was criticised by Conservative lawmakers for being slow and confusing during the coronavirus crisis.
With Britain's official COVID-19 death toll now more than 50,000, the main opposition Labour Party said the public deserved better than the government ""fighting like rats in a sack over who gets what job"".
A Labour spokeswoman said it was ""precisely this lack of focus and rank incompetence that has held Britain back."".
Cain said in a statement that ""after careful consideration I have this evening resigned as No10 director of communications and will leave the post at the end of the year"".
""It has been a privilege to work as an adviser for Mr Johnson for the last three years - being part of a team that helped him win the Tory leadership contest, secure the largest Conservative majority for three decades - and it was an honour to be asked to serve as the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff.""
Johnson described Cain ""as a true ally and friend"", thanking him in a statement for his ""extraordinary service"".
The BBC said the prime minister's official spokesman, James Slack, would take over as Johnson's director of communications at the end of the year.
BREXIT AGENDA 
Some commentators said Cain had been forced out of Downing Street after a restructuring that saw journalist-turned-government adviser Allegra Stratton appointed last month to front the prime minister’s new daily televised media briefings.
They suggested Cummings, seen as the driving force behind Johnson's agenda on anything from Brexit and his domestic policy agenda to reforming government bureaucracy, could also resign in protest. BBC reported, however, that Cummings was likely to stay on for now.
Cain, alongside Cummings, was one of a few in Downing Street who helped drive the prime minister's Brexit agenda, a cheerleader for Johnson's hardline stance to ""get Brexit done"" and ""take back control"" to restore sovereignty to Britain.

But his sometimes pugnacious style could alienate others. Some lawmakers in the governing party accuse him and Cummings of running Downing Street like a campaign bunker, wilfully ignoring the parliamentary party when making decisions.

The Crown prosecutor surprised the court by dropping charges against the digital editors of the Australian publications, the Geelong Advertiser online, the Weekly Times and The Advertiser on Thursday. 
Prosecutor Lisa De Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) gave no reason for the sudden move, more than 18 months after the charges were first laid. 
Testimony from News Corp counsel Marlia Saunders on Wednesday showed that online editors had no control over stories that were automatically uploaded to their online services by a centralised News Corp publishing system.
Charges remain against 10 journalists and several media companies. The companies have denied the charges and some of the defendants have refused to admit they knew about the gag order.
The trial is scheduled to go on until at least Nov. 20.
Pell was convicted in December 2018 of abusing two choirboys but reporting on the trial and conviction was gagged by the County Court of Victoria to ensure the cardinal received a fair trial on further charges he was due to face.
Overseas publications, including the Washington Post, reported the news shortly after the verdict, but not all of them blocked access to Australia.
After that, some Australian media published articles saying they were unable to report major news regarding an unnamed high profile figure involved in a serious crime, but some flagged that the news was accessible online.

Pell was acquitted by Australia's High Court in April after serving more than a year in jail.

The 94-year-old, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, will add another milestone when she marks her Platinum Jubilee in February 2022.
The government unveiled plans for four days of celebrations later that year to ""reflect on Her Majesty’s reign, and her impact on the UK and the world since 1952"". 
""Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee will be a truly historic moment - and one that deserves a celebration to remember,"" culture minister Oliver Dowden said.
""We can all look forward to a special, four-day Jubilee weekend, when we will put on a spectacular, once-in-a-generation show that mixes the best of British ceremonial splendour with cutting edge art and technology. 
""It will bring the entire nation and the Commonwealth together in a fitting tribute to Her Majesty’s reign.""
Elizabeth, who is also the world's current oldest and longest-reigning monarch, became queen on Feb. 6, 1952 on the death of her father George VI.
In September 2015 she overtook the length of time her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria had spent on the throne, remarking that the historical moment was ""not one to which I have ever aspired"".
""Inevitably a long life can pass by many milestones - my own is no exception,"" she said at the time.
The government said the events to mark her Platinum Jubilee would mix traditional British pageantry with cutting edge technological displays, as well as other nationwide fanfare.
A public holiday at the end of May would be moved, with an additional day off added, to allow four days of celebrations from June 2-5.
The plans are similar to those which marked the queen's 60th anniversary in 2012 when Britain held four days of events in her honour, including a huge flotilla on the River Thames and capped off with a star-studded concert at Buckingham Palace.

It will also be her second platinum anniversary; she celebrated 70 years of marriage with husband Prince Philip, 99, in November last year.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 07:07PM ET</span>",Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers to resign as Beijing moves to quash opposition,"By Jessie Pang and Sharon Tam
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's pro-democracy opposition lawmakers said on Wednesday they would resign in protest against the dismissal of four of their colleagues from the city assembly after Beijing gave local authorities new powers to further curb dissent.
The Chinese parliament earlier adopted a resolution allowing the city's executive to expel lawmakers deemed to be advocating Hong Kong independence, colluding with foreign forces or threatening national security, without having to go through the courts.
Shortly afterwards, the local government announced the disqualification of four assembly members who had previously been barred from running for re-election as authorities deemed their pledge of allegiance to Hong Kong was not sincere.
The moves will raise further concern in the West about the level of Hong Kong's autonomy, promised under a ""one country, two systems"" formula when Britain ended its colonial rule and handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.
Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab said the expulsion of the four lawmakers constituted an assault on Hong Kong's freedoms as set out in the UK-China Joint Declaration.
""This campaign to harass, stifle and disqualify democratic opposition tarnishes China's international reputation and undermines Hong Kong's long-term stability,"" Raab said in a statement.
The U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said the move showed the Chinese Communist Party had ""flagrantly violated its international commitments"" and the United States would ""continue to identify and sanction those responsible for extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom.""
On Monday, Washington imposed sanctions on four more officials in Hong Kong's governing and security establishment over their alleged role in crushing dissent.
In August, it put sanctions on Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, the territory's current and former police chiefs, and other top officials.
At a news conference in Hong Kong which started with all opposition lawmakers holding hands, Democratic Party chairman Wuu Chi-Wai said: ""We can no longer tell the world that we still have 'one country, two systems, this declares its official death.""
""CORE VALUES""
Opposition members of the city assembly, all part of the moderate old guard of democrats, say they have tried to make a stand against what many people in Hong Kong see as Beijing's whittling away of freedoms and institutional checks and balances, despite a promise of a high degree of autonomy.
""My mission as a legislator to fight for democracy and freedom cannot continue but I would certainly go along if Hong Kong people continue to fight for the core values of Hong Kong,"" one of the disqualified lawmakers, Kwok Ka-Ki, told reporters. 
China denies curbing rights and freedoms in the global financial hub, but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved swiftly to stifle dissent after anti-government protests flared in June last year and plunged the city into crisis.
The city government said in a statement the four legislators - Kwok, Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok and Kenneth Leung - were expelled from the assembly for endangering national security. 
Carrie Lam later told a briefing she welcomed diverse opinion in the 70-seat legislature but the law had to be applied.
""We could not allow members of a Legislative Council who have been judged in accordance with the law that they could not fulfil the requirement and the prerequisite for serving on the Legislative Council to continue to operate,"" she said.
Shortly after the disqualifications, China's representative office in the city said Hong Kong had to be ruled by loyalists.
""The political rule that Hong Kong must be governed by patriots shall be firmly guarded,"" the Liaison Office said.
DAMNED EITHER WAY
Analysts say mass resignations remove democracy activists' access to a forum where they could question policymakers and make them more accountable to public opinion.
But staying could have been perceived by their supporters as legitimising Beijing's move and led to discord.
""Both staying and leaving have their own difficulties,"" said Ma Ngok, associate professor of government and public administration at Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Concern about Hong Kong's promised high autonomy, which underpins its role as an international financial centre, has grown since June 30, when Beijing imposed national security legislation on the city.
The law punishes anything China considers subversion, secessionism, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Since then, authorities have removed some pro-democracy books from libraries, banned certain songs and other activities in schools, declared some slogans illegal and raided the newsroom of an anti-government tabloid.
This month, eight other opposition politicians were arrested in connection with a legislative meeting in May that descended into chaos.

Government supporters say the authorities are trying to restore stability in China's freest city after a year of unrest.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz urged the world on Thursday to take ""a decisive stance"" to address efforts by Iran to develop nuclear and ballistic missile programs, in an annual address to the top government advisory body.
""The kingdom stresses the dangers of Iran's regional project, its interference in other countries, its fostering of terrorism, its fanning the flames of sectarianism and calls for a decisive stance from the international community against Iran that guarantees a drastic handling of its efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction and develop its ballistic missiles programme,"" the king said.
They were the 84-year-old ruler's first public remarks since he addressed the United Nations General Assembly in September via videolink, where he also took aim at Iran. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran are locked in a decades-long struggle for influence across the region, supporting opposing sides in conflicts from Syria to Yemen.
There was no immediate reaction from Iran to the king's remarks. Tehran has previously described Saudi statements against it as ""baseless allegations"" and denies arming groups in the Middle East.
State news agency SPA published a full transcript of the king's speech after midnight. State TV carried photos of what appeared to be the king virtually addressing council members from his palace in Neom.
King Salman was hospitalized for several days over the summer, suffering from inflammation of the gall bladder for which he had surgery.
Tensions have risen in the region since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a landmark nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 and reimposed stringent economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed's relationship with Trump had provided a buffer against international criticism over Riyadh's rights record sparked by the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Riyadh's role in Yemen's war and the detention of women activists.
Those areas may now become points of friction with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who pledged in his campaign to reassess ties with the kingdom, a major oil exporter and buyer of U.S. arms. 
Saudi Arabia was an enthusiastic backer of Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran. But Biden has said he would return to a 2015 nuclear pact between world powers and Tehran, a deal negotiated when Biden was vice president in Barack Obama's administration.
In Yemen, where Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition battling the Iran-aligned Houthis in a nearly six year war that has killed tens of thousands, King Salman said the kingdom continues to support U.N.-led efforts to reach a political settlement. 
He also condemned the Iran-aligned Houthi movement's ""deliberate and methodological"" targeting of civilians inside Saudi Arabia via drones and ballistic missiles. 
Riyadh was working to guarantee the stability of global oil supplies to serve both producers and consumers, despite Covid-19's impact on oil markets, the king said.
He repeated his long-standing support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, but did not refer to the U.S.-brokered agreements signed between the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan to normalise ties with Israel, part of a strategic realignment against Iran.
Riyadh has quietly acquiesced to the UAE and Bahrain deals, though it has stopped short of endorsing them, and has signaled it is not ready to take action itself.
The king spoke days before the Group of 20 summit, which Saudi Arabia is hosting virtually this year. 

Prince Mohammed had denied ordering Khashoggi's killing but in 2019 he acknowledged some personal accountability by saying that it happened on his watch. Riyadh has jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years in the case.

There were no reports of any injuries.
The Metropolitan Police said the incident took place just before 7 p.m. at Edmonton Police station which was then evacuated. The police said an investigation was being led by a local team with the support of counter-terrorism officers.
The Guardian said the initial view was that the incident was not terrorism-related. There were no further details from police about the nature of the incident. 
Ambulances and fire engines were sent to the scene and a police cordon was put in place. 
Unverified footage on social media showed a car at the front of the station and a man appearing to start a fire on the street outside before being grappled onto the ground by officers.
""The cordon has been reduced and officers have returned to the station,"" police said in a statement. 
Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, said on Twitter: ""I’m grateful to the police officers and other emergency services who brought the situation under control and continue to investigate the incident.""

Earlier this month, the terrorism threat level in Britain was raised to ""severe"", meaning an attack was seen as highly likely, after incidents in France and Austria, although the government said there was no specific threat.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's new president, Luis Arce, has moved swiftly to restore ties with Iran and Venezuela, receiving the credentials of ambassadors from the two countries on Wednesday, just three days after his socialist party retook the reins of power. 
Bolivia's government said in a statement it wanted to ""reestablish diplomatic relations damaged by the previous de-facto government"" led by conservative interim president Jeanine Anez.
Writing on Twitter, Arce said he was restoring bilateral relations with Venezuela ""to strengthen strategic ties for the good of our peoples."" 
He said the same was being done with Iran and that ""they are always welcome in Bolivia. We will continue to strengthen common projects.""
Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif attended Arce's swearing-in ceremony in La Paz on Sunday as part of a tour of leftist Latin American nations that included Venezuela and Cuba.
Venezuela and Iran were key allies for former Bolivian president and Arce ally Evo Morales, who swept to office as the country's first indigenous president in 2006 and resigned under pressure over disputed elections last year. 
Morales had planned to make Iran a partner in the exploitation of its bountiful lithium reserves, while he and longtime ally President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela frequently sympathized publicly over what they called U.S. ""meddling"" in the region. 
But days after Anez took power last November, Venezuelan diplomats and Cuban doctors were expelled amid accusations by the interim government that they had fomented unrest following Morales' departure.
Now, with the return to power of Morales' socialist MAS party - with Arce at the helm following elections in October - Bolivia is resetting its foreign policy once more. 
On Monday, Morales returned to Bolivia from exile in Argentina and on Wednesday he was feted in a ceremony in Chimore, a town in his native Chapare province, a central coca-growing region. 
In a speech, Morales urged Latin American nations to maintain their sovereignty over natural resources. 
""The West, that is the industrialized countries, only want us Latin Americans so that we can guarantee them raw material,"" he said in a broadcast speech.

Arce did not attend the event and has not yet referred publicly to the return of Morales, whom he has said will play no role in his government.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Millions of men, women and children in war-torn Yemen are facing famine - again, top United Nations officials warned on Wednesday as they appealed for more money to prevent it - again. 
""We are on a countdown right now to a catastrophe,"" U.N. food chief David Beasley told the U.N. Security Council. ""We have been here before ... We did almost the same dog-and-pony show. We sounded the alarm then.""
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the people in need of help. 
""If we choose to look away, there's no doubt in my mind Yemen will be plunged into a devastating famine within a few short months,"" Beasley told the 15-member council.
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country's suffering is also worsened by an economic and currency collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In late 2017, U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock warned that Yemen was then facing ""the largest famine the world has seen for many decades with millions of victims"".
""We prevented famine two years ago,"" Lowcock told the Security Council on Wednesday. ""More money for the aid operation is the quickest and most efficient way to support famine prevention efforts right now.""
He said the world body had received less than half of what it needed - about $1.5 billion - this year for its humanitarian operations in Yemen. Last year it received $3 billion. 

""When I think about what famine would mean, I am really at a loss to understand why more is not being done to prevent it,"" Lowcock said. ""It is a terrible, agonizing and humiliating death ... Yemenis are not 'going hungry'. They are being starved.""

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, in a televised speech, described Trump's administration as ""among the worst, if not the worst"" in the United States, but said the new president would not alter Washington's pro-Israel policy in the Middle East.
Describing the U.S. elections as a travesty of democracy, he accused Trump of having no restraints and said his administration's ""arrogance and aggressiveness"" had heightened the possibility of war. 
The Iran-backed Hezbollah leader said he derived personal pleasure at the outcome of the U.S. elections also because Trump had ordered the killing of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani.
""With a person like Trump anything is possible during the remainder of his term ... the axis of resistance should be in a state of high readiness to respond twice as hard in case of any American or Israeli folly,"" Nasrallah said, referring to Hezbollah and Iran's allies in the region.
The Trump administration has widened sanctions against Hezbollah, which Washington deems a terrorist group, and its Lebanese allies as part of a maximum pressure campaign against Iran that heightened regional tensions.

Nasrallah said U.S. sanctions imposed last week on Gebran Bassil, the son-in-law of Lebanon's president, over charges of corruption and ties to Hezbollah were part of Washington's efforts to pressure the armed movement's political allies.

(Reuters) - Tropical Storm Eta spun toward Florida's west coast on Wednesday, nearing its fourth landfall in a matter of days, while threatening squall winds and storm surges, and prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency in 13 counties. 
Eta, which had weakened slightly from its hurricane strength earlier on Wednesday to become a tropical storm, is the 28th named storm of the busiest Atlantic hurricane season on record, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. It was projected to make its fourth landfall early on Thursday, this time north of Tampa Bay, after it already slammed Central America, Cuba and the upper Florida Keys.
It had dropped nearly 18 inches of rain over parts of South Florida by Monday, moved southwest and then stalled over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday before making a northward turn. It is was last moving on a north-northeast trajectory at 10 miles per hour (16 kph). 
The storm was about 115 miles (180 km) south-southwest of Tampa, with maximum sustained winds of 70 miles per hour (110 kph)on Wednesday, the NHC said.
The west coast of Florida faces ""the multiple threats of a landfalling hurricane or tropical storm,"" said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, listing the heavy rainfall, storm surge and possible tornadoes in the forecast.
""One is of course the wind, which could be at the very least gusting to hurricane force, and sustained tropical storm force winds. That's enough to do some damage,"" Feltgen said.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 13 counties in Eta's path on Wednesday and requested that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declare a pre-landfall state of emergency for those counties as well, to mobilize resources.
The storm surge from Eta was expected to affect southern and western Florida and the Florida Keys on Wednesday and Thursday. The state's west coast was under a storm surge watch on Wednesday from the Suwanee River to Bonita Beach, including Tampa Bay, where the water could rise up to 5 feet. 
""These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" the NHC said in an advisory. 
Tampa International Airport said on Twitter it would suspend operations at 3 p.m. on Wednesday due to the impending storm. 

Parts of Broward County, on Florida's east coast, were still severely flooded on Wednesday, with lakes having overflowed and residential streets submerged. Rainfall totals from Eta could add up to 20 inches in some parts of South Florida, the NHC said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Georgia will re-count all paper ballots cast in the Nov. 3 presidential election by hand, the state's top election official said on Wednesday, a mammoth task that must be completed by Nov. 20.
Democrat Joe Biden secured more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to gain the presidency on Saturday by winning Pennsylvania after four tense days of counting, delayed by a surge in mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic. Adding Georgia would only add to Biden's margin of victory.
Republican President Donald Trump has refused to concede defeat and has said - without citing evidence - that the voting was marred by fraud. 
The vote count in Georgia showed Biden ahead of Trump by just 14,101 votes out of some 5 million across the state. With the margin so small, a recount is needed, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a news conference. 
""You actually have to do a full hand-by-hand recount of all because the margin is so close,"" Raffensperger said. ""We want to start this before the week is up.""
""People will be working lots of overtime over the next coming weeks,"" he said.
Officials will work in pairs, sorting stacks of ballots into piles and counting them under the watch of observers from both political parties, Raffensperger said. The piles will include ballots cast in person and by mail, he said.
""That's how it's going to be all the way through, and you're going to tally it all up. It's a big process,"" he said.
The scale of the endeavour is such that if counting takes place round-the-clock, officials will have to count more than 23,000 ballots an hour in the nine days before the deadline for the results to be certified.
A study by the non-partisan group Fair Vote found that out of 31 statewide recounts between 2000 and 2019, the outcome changed in only three of them. More often, the winner won by a tiny bit more. On average, they shifted the outcome by 0.024%, Fair Vote found - a much smaller margin than Trump would need. Biden currently leads Trump in Georgia by 49.5% to 49.2%.

Georgia's two U.S. senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans, on Monday called on Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, to resign over his management of the election. They presented no evidence of fraud, however.

Ouattara met former president and opposition candidate Henri Konan Bedie in the commercial capital Abidjan in a bid to calm tensions over the vote, which handed Ouattara a third term that his opponents say is illegal.
In comments to journalists, both said the meeting had been an important first step towards a peaceful resolution of the crisis, but did not indicate that either side had made or was prepared to make any concessions.
""We met and decided to make peace in Ivory Coast,"" Ouattara said, describing the encounter as an ice-breaker.
Bedie said: ""In the days and weeks ahead, we will call each other and meet so that the country becomes what it was before.""
Earlier the government updated the death toll from recent fighting between rival political supporters to 85 - including 34 killed before the vote, 20 on election day and 31 since then.
While the violence has not been as widespread as some feared, many Ivorians worry about a repeat of the civil war that followed the 2010 election. About 3,000 people died in the war, which was fought largely along ethnic lines.
Bedie's party and political allies have said that progress to end the current dispute will only be possible if the authorities meet certain demands, including dropping criminal charges against other opposition leaders for forming a rival government.

The disagreement stems from Ouattara's decision to seek a third term, which opposition groups say violates a constitutional two-term limit. The president maintains the approval of a new constitution in 2016 allowed him to restart his mandate.

Lopez Obrador, who accused rivals of electoral fraud in his presidential defeats in 2006 and 2012, says he has no side in the U.S. election, and will wait until legal challenges launched by the Trump administration over the vote have played out.
""We can't make any kind of recognition of a government that is not yet legally and legitimately constituted,"" he told a news conference. ""It's not up to us, that's interventionism.""
Lopez Obrador showed no such hesitation in congratulating the victors of Bolivia's divisive 2019 presidential election, which was later annulled over irregularities. Critics charge his position on Biden does not look neutral.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to hurt Mexico economically if it does not curb illegal immigration, has refused to accept defeat and launched lawsuits to press claims of election fraud. State officials have said they are not aware of any significant irregularities.
Biden, a Democrat, cleared the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency on Saturday.
While in opposition, Lopez Obrador likened Trump to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and pledged to put him ""in his place"" if elected. Since taking office nearly two years ago, he has been at pains to avoid conflict with the American president.
His attitude on the vote has upset some Democrats but Lopez Obrador insisted there would be no repercussions for Mexico.
""Because we're adhering to our policy of principles,"" he said. ""Also, we're not a colony. We're a free, independent, sovereign country. The Mexican government is not a puppet of any foreign government.""

Left-leaning Lopez Obrador is part a shrinking group of world leaders yet to congratulate Biden, along with Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Far-right sympathisers clashed with police on Wednesday near Poland's National Stadium, recently converted into a COVID-19 field hospital, at the end of an Independence Day march that took place in defiance of pandemic restrictions.
Planned as a drive through the capital's main roads to circumvent a ban from city hall, the annual event took a different form as thousands of people marched on foot through central Warsaw in addition to those driving.
Police in riot gear used pepper spray to break up sporadic scuffles along the route.
""Where there is brutal action on the part of people, where there is damage to property ... when policemen are hospitalised, they need medical assistance, no there is nothing called a peaceful gathering,"" said Warsaw police spokesman Sylwester Marczak.
Marczak said police had been attacked with rocks and flares, resulting in several injuries to officers.
The annual event has become a point of friction between far-right groups and supporters of the nationalist government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on one side, and their liberal opponents on the other.
Robert Bakiewicz, the head of the association that organises the march, blamed the violence on the police, saying they had provoked marchers near the National Stadium.
Marczak said police had blocked the protesters in the vicinity to protect a route used to transport ventilators for the handful of COVID-19 patients being treated there.
The country has seen soaring numbers of coronavirus infections, with the total number of cases more than quadrupling in a month.
MASS PROTESTS
In recent weeks Poland has seen mass street protests sparked by a ruling by the Constitutional Court that introduced a near-total ban on abortion in the predominantly Catholic nation.
The Independence Day march organisers sought to paint the decision as part of a fight against attempts to challenge traditional values.
""What will remain of today's independence march ... is a desire to show that we are a state or a society ... which relates to these traditional, conservative, Christian, Catholic values,"" Bakiewicz told state-run broadcaster TVP Info.
""We do not want this neo-Bolshevik revolution on our streets.""
Marchers carried red-and-white Polish flags amidst clouds of smoke from red flares and held up banners that read ""Our civilisation, our rules"".
Others carried religious symbols or banners showing the Communist hammer and sickle emblem crossed out.
A truck with a banner ""No to Jewish demands"" also appeared, in an apparent reference to far-right groups' opposition to any return of property taken from Jews during the Holocaust.
Another truck bore the slogan ""Normal family - strong Poland"", a phrase used by right-wing parties in Poland to express their resistance to LGBT rights.
Footage posted on social media showed flames coming from the window of a flat near the demonstrations. A Warsaw fire brigade spokesman said the blaze was probably caused by a flare or firecracker, and that nobody had been hurt in the incident.
Authorities in Warsaw, which is governed by a centrist mayor, accused the state-run police force of facilitating the march.
""The law is being broken here,"" said Karolina Galecka, a city hall spokeswoman. ""Police have spent 12 hours preparing to secure the march, we were not informed about this ... and at this point you could say the police are co-organising it.""
Marczak said the police were simply preparing for all eventualities.

""The Polish police are professional and responsible, so we are not preparing for one variant of an event.""

More than 15,400 people this year have braved the perilous Atlantic crossing from Africa to the Canaries, which lie around 100 km (60 miles) off Morocco's west coast, 10 times more than in 2019.
Nearly 1,800 African migrants were stranded in a dockside camp on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria on Wednesday after a wave of arrivals overwhelmed local authorities' capacity to house them, officials said. Others are being hosted in hotels on the archipelago.
""We have shown a lot of solidarity and we have preferred to help in a human way to avoid a (migration) drama like the ones we have seen in other European territories, but now we have to find other solutions,"" said Tom Smulders, spokesman and vice-president of the Canaries' FEHT hotel federation.
Smulders said that up to 10 tourism complexes in Gran Canaria hosting migrants could continue doing so for a couple more months but that the government and EU must find other solutions, such as using military facilities.

""We cannot allocate more tourism complexes (to this),"" he told Reuters, adding that the archipelago cannot ""become the reception centre for the whole of Europe.""

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Stockholm scrambled on Wednesday to curb COVID-19 infections at its nursing homes, reimposing a ban on visits and piloting rapid-result coronavirus testing of staff.
Sweden's nursing homes, particularly in the capital, were ravaged by the initial wave of the pandemic, prompting Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's sombre admission in May that the country failed to protect its elderly.
After slowing to a trickle in summer, infections at Stockholm's nursing homes have shot up in recent weeks. Of the region's 313 facilities, 48 now have cases, data showed, an increase of more than 20 from last week. 
""It's really, really frightening,"" said Johan Styrud, chairman of the Swedish Medical Association in Stockholm and doctor at Danderyd Hospital.
""We must do everything we can to keep the infection from getting back into nursing homes again.""
More than 1,000 residents with COVID-19 have died at Stockholm's nursing homes during the pandemic and with new cases climbing, local authorities on Wednesday to reimposed a ban on visitors which was dropped nationally last month.
""We are seeing a huge increase of confirmed cases and the past week has been dramatic,"" Maria Rotzen Ostlund, acting chief epidemiologist in region of Stockholm, said.
""We've had fantastic increase in testing capacity (since spring outbreak) but right now it's not enough."" 
Surging demand has forced regions such as Stockholm to tighten requirements for standard laboratory PCR tests. Now a pilot project is being rolled out at city homes using rapid antigen tests to show within 15 minutes if a member of staff is infected.
Sweden's Health Agency has estimated around 90% of confirmed cases at nursing homes were infected by staff amid a lack of safety equipment and testing during the early stages of the pandemic.
""This can be a gamechanger because now we can identify carriers of the virus before they spread it to elderly people,"" said Stefan Amer, CEO of Familjelakarna, which provides medical services at roughly half the region's nursing homes.
Antigen tests quickly detect proteins on the surface of the virus but are considered less accurate than laboratory PCR tests which detect genetic material in the virus.

If successful - antigen test results will be compared with PCR test also being carried out - the system could be rolled out broadly and used whenever a staffer, or visitor when such are allowed, enters the building, Amer said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea on Wednesday dubbed the global atomic watchdog ""a marionette dancing to the tune of the hostile forces"" as the International Atomic Energy Agency chief warned that Pyongyang's nuclear activities remain ""a cause for serious concern.""
The Vienna-based IAEA has not had access to North Korea since the isolated Asian state expelled IAEA inspectors in 2009. Since then Pyongyang has pressed ahead with its nuclear weapons program, conducting its last nuclear test in September 2017.
The United Nations specialized agency has been monitoring North Korea from afar, including with satellite imagery. 
""The DPRK's nuclear activities remain a cause for serious concern. The continuation of the country's nuclear program is a clear violation of relevant Security Council resolutions and is deeply regrettable,"" IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday.
North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Kim Song rejected an annual IAEA report submitted to the General Assembly as ""it is completely pervaded with guesswork and fabrication.""
""The IAEA is no more than a political tool of the western countries,"" Kim said. ""The DPRK will never have any business to deal with the IAEA so long as it runs short of impartiality and objectivity ... and remains a marionette dancing to the tune of the hostile forces against the DPRK.""
North Korea has been subjected to U.N. Security Council sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The 15-member council has steadily strengthened sanctions in a bid to cut off funding for those programs.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea's demands for an end to sanctions.

Khairi Saadallah, 26, was accused of murdering the men and stabbing three others with a five-inch knife during the attack in a park in the town on the evening of June 20.
The BBC said Saadallah, who a security source told Reuters at the time of the incident was a Libyan national, had admitted murder and attempted murder at a hearing at London's Old Bailey Central Criminal Court.
However, while the prosecution said the attack was a pre-meditated terrorism attack, his defence team did not accept that and said his mental health needed to be taken into account, the BBC reported. 
Saadallah had targeted a group of seven friends, stabbing three fatally - James Furlong, 36, and David Wails, 49, from Britain and U.S. national Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39.
Another of the group required 28 stitches to a head wound. Two other men who were sitting with friends nearby were also stabbed, one in the back while the other suffered a cut to his cheek.
An off-duty police officer who was at the scene followed the attacker from the park and he was arrested nearby.

Earlier this month, the terrorism threat level in Britain was raised to ""severe"", meaning an attack is seen as highly likely, after recent incidents in France and Austria, although the government said there was no specific threat.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in his first public comment after the release of an explosive report on the Vatican's mishandling of the case of ex-U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, on Wednesday again vowed to put an end to sexual abuse in the Church.
""Yesterday, the report about the painful case of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was published. I renew my closeness to the victims of every abuse and the commitment of the Church to uproot this evil,"" Francis said at his weekly general audience. 
He then closed his eyes and prayed silently.
The 450-page report said the late Pope John Paul II promoted McCarrick in 2000 despite rumours of his sexual misconduct, one of a series of failings by popes and officials who let him rise through the ranks regardless of repeated allegations against him.
The report also said that in 2008 former Pope Benedict overruled proposals from top aides that McCarrick undergo a Church investigation ""to determine the truth and, if warranted, impose an 'exemplary measure'"". He was instead given a verbal warning and told to keep a low profile.
Francis' words also followed an independent inquiry in London on Tuesday that said the Roman Catholic Church in Britain betrayed its moral purpose over decades by protecting those who sexually abused children rather than caring for their victims.

Last week in Poland, the Vatican disciplined an elderly cardinal who was accused of sexually abusing a minor, the latest of several clerics to be caught up in a widening scandal in the homeland of the late Pope John Paul II.

Kabuga, 85, appeared frail and did not respond to questions from judges. He was arrested in France in May after decades on the run and transferred to a United Nations detention centre in The Hague on Oct. 26.
""We have talked about this with Mr Kabuga before the hearing and he does not wish to answer in these conditions. I would appreciate it if you would consider his non-response as a plea of not guilty,"" lawyer Emmanuel Altit told the court, after the presiding judge asked Kabuga to enter a plea.
Judge Iain Bonomy entered the not guilty plea and ordered an assessment of Kabuga's health. 
Prosecutors have charged Kabuga with five counts of genocide, accusing him of operating a hate speech radio station which fanned the flames of ethnic hatred against people identified as Tutsis during the 1994 killings in Rwanda. 
They say the former tea and coffee tycoon also financed ethnic Hutu militias who killed hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda during a 100-day period in 1994.
Kabuga dismissed the accusations against him as ""lies"" during French extradition hearings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska won re-election, Edison Research and television networks projected on Wednesday, leaving control of the Senate to be determined in January by two runoff elections in Georgia.
Sullivan, 55, defeated Al Gross, an independent who ran as a Democrat in an election that some political analysts had seen as a potential opportunity for Democrats to capture a Republican Senate seat. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Democrats clinched their hold on the U.S. House of Representatives, but with a slimmer majority.
The race was called with Sullivan leading Gross by 20 percentage points, 57.5% to 37.5%.
A former U.S. Marine, Sullivan ran on his conservative record in the Senate while branding Gross as a candidate in league with national Democrats, including Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer.
Gross, a 58-year-old orthopedic surgeon, had raised more than twice as much campaign money as Sullivan. But his financial edge was not enough for victory. 
In the campaign, Gross emphasized his knowledge of the healthcare system and sought to portray Sullivan as a rubber stamp for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump, who was also projected to be winner of the presidential race in Alaska.
Coming a day after Republican Senator Thom Tillis won re-election in North Carolina, Sullivan's victory confirms that Democratic hopes of winning a majority of seats, and with it the power to support Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's agenda, will come down to two Georgia elections scheduled for Jan. 5. 
With Biden's White House victory, Democrats need to pick up three Republican Senate seats to hold 50 Senate seats, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris wielding the tie-breaking vote.
Biden has surpassed the 270 Electoral College votes needed to defeat Trump.
Democrats won Republican seats in Arizona and Colorado in last week's election. But they lost a seat in Alabama, reducing their net gain to a single seat. 

In Georgia, Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler face challenges from Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - The fate of Armenia's prime minister hung in the balance on Wednesday after parliament agreed to discuss protesters' demands for his resignation over a ceasefire that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh.
The ceasefire, announced on Tuesday, ended six weeks of fighting - the worst in the mountain enclave for decades - and has been celebrated as a victory in Azerbaijan.
Thousands of Armenians protested in the capital Yerevan, demanding Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan step down, and several hundred marched on parliament. Some chanted ""Nikol is a traitor"". Others shouted: ""Nikol, leave.""
Pashinyan has said he had no choice but to sign the agreement to prevent further territorial losses.
But, after protesters set a midnight deadline for Pashinyan to quit, parliament announced it would hold a special session on Wednesday evening to discuss the calls for his resignation.
The ceasefire halted military action in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians. Under the agreement, 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are being deployed to the region.
Since the early 1990s, ethnic Armenians had held military control over all of Nagorno-Karabakh and substantial swaths of Azeri territory surrounding it. They have now lost much of the enclave itself as well as the surrounding territory.
Pashinyan said he concluded the peace deal under pressure from his army. Nagorno-Karabakh's leader said there had been a risk of Azerbaijan taking control of the whole enclave following the fall of its second biggest city, Shushi, known by Azeris as Shusha. 
""This is a big failure and disaster,"" Pashinyan said on Tuesday. He said he was taking personal responsibility for the setbacks, but he rejected calls to step down.
OPPOSITION LEADER ARRESTED
Seventeen political parties called Wednesday's protest to step up demands for Pashinyan to quit.
A number of protesters were arrested, including Gagik Tsarukyan, leader of the opposition Prosperous Armenia party, according to a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post by Hripsime Arakelian, a member of his party. Prosperous Armenia is the second biggest faction in parliament.
Russian peacekeepers - who are due to stay in the region for five years - started leaving Russia on Tuesday and are now controlling the Lachin corridor, a mountain pass linking Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, the Russian army said.
For Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia and a military base there, securing the ceasefire deal sent a signal that it is still the main arbiter in the energy-producing South Caucasus, which it sees as its own backyard.
Turkey also flexed its muscles during the conflict, providing diplomatic support and arms supplies for Azerbaijan. It was not involved in mediating the ceasefire deal and has not contributed any peacekeepers.
But Turkey and Russia signed an agreement establishing a joint centre to monitor the ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh on Wednesday and will work together there, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said.

Though Azerbaijan has hailed the ceasefire agreement as a victory, some Azeris are frustrated that Azeri forces stopped fighting before regaining control of all of Nagorno-Karabakh. Other Azeris are wary about the arrival of peacekeepers from Russia, which dominated the region in Soviet times.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain's Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al Khalifa, the world's longest serving prime minister who repeatedly put down opposition unrest during his near half century in power, has died, authorities said on Wednesday.
Sheikh Khalifa, a dominant figure in the Gulf Arab kingdom's politics, passed away on Wednesday morning at Mayo Clinic hospital in the United States, Bahrain's state news agency said. 
Khalifa, 84, the uncle of King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, had served as prime minister since the Sunni Muslim-led island declared independence from Britain in 1971. The al-Khalifa family has ruled since 1783.
His stern response to pro-democracy protests in Bahrain in 2011 -- and criticism of similar unrest across the Arab world -- underlined what for many was the defining characteristic of his career, namely a stalwart defence of dynastic rule.
""The death of the world's longest serving prime Minister will be welcomed by many of Bahrain's political opposition, as he is regarded as one of the chief architects of an increasingly repressive state,"" said Marc Owen Jones, Assistant Professor of Middle East Studies at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Qatar. 
Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, a prominent Bahraini rights campaigner exiled in Britain, said Sheikh Khalifa had masterminded ""brutal repression"" of the opposition during the 1990s and oversaw the crackdown on the 2011 uprising.
Leaders from neighbouring countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, offered condolences to King Hamad and paid tribute to Sheikh Khalifa.
""The late Prince Sheikh Khalifa... was a man of historic stature whose name was associated with the modern transformation of Bahrain and the Arabian Gulf,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter. He added: ""He was a man of solid positions and principles.""
Human rights groups have criticised Bahrain's Western allies, notably the United States and Britain, for often remaining silent about allegations of human rights abuses against the Shi'ite majority.
The two countries have a particularly high level of influence in Bahrain, where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based and where Britain's Royal Navy has a major facility.
There was no immediate word about Sheikh Khalifa's successor as prime minister, a role which the constitution says is appointed by the king.
""While his succession is unclear it paves the way for the growing unencumbered influence of the crown prince, who will have more of a say in social and perhaps economic affairs,"" own Jones said. 
Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, since his appointment as Crown Prince in 1999, has become known as the ruling family's leading proponent of reform, although most meaningful changes were consistently blocked by family hardliners such as Sheikh Khalifa. 
In August, Sheikh Kahlifa left the kingdom for what official media called at the time ""a private visit abroad"". 
Earlier this year he spent time in Germany for unspecified medical treatment, returning to Bahrain in March.
The burial ceremony will take place upon the repatriation of his body and the funeral will be limited to a specific number of relatives, Bahrain's state news agency said. 

Official mourning has been declared for a week and government ministries and departments will close for three days starting Thursday.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al Assad on Wednesday blamed U.S. sanctions and pressure on Syria's neighbours for the reticence of more than 5 million refugees who fled the conflict there to return.
Of Syria’s 17 million people, 5.5 million are living as refugees in the region, mostly in Turkey, and a further 6 million are uprooted within their own country.
Western countries and all of Syria's neighbours with the exception of Lebanon say conditions are not safe for the voluntary return of refugees, many of whom fled from Russian and Syrian government bombing of their towns during the course of the decade-old conflict.
""There are many hurdles,"" Assad said, at the opening of a conference in Damascus, co-hosted by Moscow, that has been boycotted by Washington, the European Union and most of Syria's neighbours that host the bulk the refugees.
He said millions of refugees were being forced to stay in host countries by ""pressure or intimidation"" and that host states were enticing them financially while benefiting from international aid for them.
Assad said U.S.-led sanctions were hampering flow of much needed funds for reconstruction that would create jobs that would entice more refugees to return.
EU policy chief Josep Borrell said on Tuesday the body had turned down an invitation to attend the conference as ""the priority at present is real action to create conditions for safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons to their areas of origin"".
He cited obstacles to a safe return that included indiscriminate detention, torture and inadequate basic services.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov criticised Washington and its allies for declining to attend the conference and blamed Assad's opponents who backed insurgents for the exodus of millions of Syrians.
""We consider this approach of our opponents yet another evidence of double standards concerning Syria,"" Lavrov said in a speech delivered by President Vladimir Putin's envoy for Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev.

Putin last week praised Assad for his efforts to try to get more than 850,000 Syrians back home, saying it was crucial for the country's ""post-conflict recovery"".

According to a complaint filed in a federal court in western Michigan, many people have submitted affidavits describing alleged misconduct in the voting, with the focus on the Democratic stronghold of Wayne County, which includes Detroit.
The allegations are similar to those raised by the Trump campaign and some Republicans in lawsuits in several states. Legal experts have said the litigation is unlikely to result in Trump getting a second term in the White House.
Trump's campaign has alleged that misconduct in Michigan included harassment of Republican poll challengers and a requirement that they adhere to six-foot distancing rules unlike Democratic poll challengers, and that ""illegal and ineligible ballots were counted.""
The complaint said election results should not be certified without confirming that all ballots were counted properly, and a special election might be needed in problematic precincts.
Jake Rollow, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of State, in a statement said the Trump campaign was promoting false claims to erode public confidence in Michigan's elections.
""It does not change the truth: Michigan's elections were conducted fairly, securely, transparently, and the results are an accurate reflection of the will of the people,"" Rollow said.
Trump has refused to concede to Biden, and has claimed without evidence that widespread fraud cost him a victory.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday proposed rules which would give the EU the power to declare a health emergency and stress test national plans to tackle pandemics, in a potential blow to the World Health Organization.
The move follows an often uncoordinated reaction by the 27 EU governments to the COVID-19 pandemic, which at the beginning of the crisis led to competition on vital medical gear and export bans on medicines.
It also comes after the WHO was criticised for having declared the pandemic, which first emerged in China at the end of last year, too late. The U.N. agency has repeatedly denied the accusation. 
Under the proposals, the EU would be able to declare an EU-level public health emergency, which would in turn trigger more coordination among EU states.
Currently, the EU relies on the WHO to declare such an emergency.
""The new rules will enable the activation of EU emergency response mechanisms (..) without making it contingent upon the WHO's own declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,"" an EU document says, adding that such a move would be coordinated with the WHO.
If adopted, the overhaul would partly take away a major power from the WHO, as EU states call for reform of the organisation to address shortfalls in emergencies.
""We relied too much on the WHO for the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Peter Liese, a top EU lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, said. 
""Under pressure from China, the WHO declared the health emergency too late. It is therefore very important to have the possibility to act at European level in future similar situations.""
The WHO, which the Trump administration has labelled a puppet of China, was not immediately available to comment.
COORDINATION ON VACCINES
Under the commission's proposals, the EU would help governments prepare pandemic plans and would audit and stress test them, an EU document says.
EU states have traditionally been reluctant to give more powers to Brussels on the matter.
During the pandemic, they have applied different national measures on a series of issues, including testing policies for COVID-19 cases, quarantine rules and travel restrictions. 
But they have shown good coordination on procuring vaccines.
If approved by EU governments and EU lawmakers, the commission said the proposals would be immediately applicable and could strengthen EU powers to tackle the current pandemic, in which most European countries are seeing a surge in cases.
Brussels wants to strengthen the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, whose non-binding advice, such as on the length of quarantine after contact with an infected person, has often been ignored.
It also wants more power for the EU Medicines Agency to prevent risks of shortages of medicines and medical devices.

Brussels also said it would unveil by the end of next year plans for a new health authority modelled after the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which has played a vital role in procuring experimental dugs and vaccines.

The court said a lower court had been wrong to deny bail to Arnab Goswami and ordered his release on bail of 50,000 rupees ($670).
Police said the decorator had left behind a suicide note saying Goswami's Republic TV had not paid him for design work on its Mumbai-based television studio, leaving him in deep debt. 
The channel, which has a reputation for shouting down guests at its nightly debates, said the 2018 case was fabricated and that the local government, run by parties opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was punishing it for its news coverage.
Goswami's arrest drew contrasting reactions and exposed divisions within Indian politics. Several members of Modi's government condemned the detention as an attack on the press. 
But others said the BJP had itself been hostile to journalists in states that it governed. 
Himanta Biswa Sarma, a minister from Modi's BJP in the northeastern state of Assam, said he was ""extremely pleased"" with the court's decision. 

""Justice prevails!,"" he said on Twitter. ""With this, I sincerely hope the wicked witch hunt against @republic Editor in Chief, and the channel, comes to an end.""

The move follows a shooting rampage in Vienna last week in which a convicted jihadist who had been released early from prison killed four people and was shot dead by police. 
The 20-year-old gunman had been sentenced to 22 months for trying to join Islamic State in Syria. Austria has admitted to an intelligence failure in the run-up to the attack.
""If a mentally abnormal criminal can be locked up for life because he is a threat, then a terrorist who poses a threat can be locked up for life,"" conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told a news conference on a package of planned anti-terrorism measures.
Kurz said that could become an option for courts when sentencing those convicted of jihadist crimes. For those who have already served their sentence, Austria would plan more systematic monitoring through electronic tagging.
Last week's attack was the first such deadly militant assault in a generation in the small, neutral country.
Proportionally, Austria has a relatively large number of people who have joined Islamic State in Syria or Iraq or sought to. Kurz put the number of ""foreign terrorist fighters"" in Austria at more than 150, some of whom are in prison. 
In addition, more than 100 have yet to return to Austria, he added.
It was not clear how such indefinite custody would be made compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. When asked if similar measures exist elsewhere, Kurz said some countries had reinforced their measures but did not name any.

Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler, who leads the junior coalition party, the Greens, said the new measures would apply to ""all forms of terror"", including ""terror by neo-Nazis"".

The explosion was the second security incident to take place in the Red Sea port city in the last couple of weeks, and the first attack with explosives in years to attempt to hit foreigners in the conservative kingdom.
France's Foreign Ministry said the attack had taken place at a ceremony in Jeddah involving foreign embassies. A Greek official told Reuters four people had been wounded.
""There was some sort of a blast at the non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah. There are four slightly injured, among them one Greek,"" the Greek official told Reuters, declining to named. 
The Mecca governorate said the attack caused two injuries - a Greek consulate employee and a Saudi guard.
""The embassies that were involved in the commemoration ceremony condemn this cowardly attack, which is completely unjustified,"" a French Foreign Ministry statement said. 
""They call on the Saudi authorities to shed as much light as they can on this attack, and to identify and hunt down the perpetrators.""
A source with knowledge of the matter said the attack happened early on Wednesday when several diplomatic delegations from the European Union and other countries were present at a Remembrance Day event organised by the French Embassy. 
The French consulate in Jeddah, in a statement seen by Reuters, urged its nationals in Saudi Arabia to use ""maximum vigilance"" following the attack. The French embassy in the UAE also called on residents there to stay vigilant.
""In particular, exercise discretion, stay away from all gatherings and be cautious when moving around,"" said the statement, which was emailed to French residents in Jeddah. The statement said only two people had been injured. 
The embassies of France, Greece, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States said they had assured Saudi authorities they would support an investigation into the attack and its perpetrators.
Al Ekhbariya state TV said authorities secured the cemetery following the incident, and showed footage of the surrounding streets, adding that traffic was normal in the area and that the situation was stable.
On Oct. 29 a Saudi man was arrested after attacking and wounding a security guard at the French consulate there.
It followed the beheading earlier in October near Paris of a French school teacher by a man of Chechen origin who had said he wanted to punish the teacher for showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics lesson.
French officials have since reasserted the right to display the cartoons as a matter of free expression, stirring anger in parts of the Muslim world. Saudi Arabia condemned cartoons offending the Prophet Mohammad, but held back from echoing calls by other Muslim states for action against images of the Prophet being shown in France.

The case has caused a diplomatic chill between Canada and China, which soon after Meng's arrest detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on espionage charges.

The move comes on time for what is traditionally the Caribbean island nation's high tourist season from November to March although the pandemic is expected to reduce the flow of visitors.
The tourism sector is one of the top hard currency income earners in cash-strapped Cuba which already opened most of the country last month to travelers.
Plunged into crisis and scarcity by tough U.S. sanctions and the COVID-19 outbreak, the import-dependent country is struggling towards a ""new normal"".
The Cuban government said it was holding off on opening up the capital until its coronavirus outbreak was sufficiently contained.
Authorities will test all international travelers for coronavirus on arrival, state-run media said, and will levy a sanitary tariff in order to cover the extra costs of new hygiene protocols.

Cuba does not require travelers to take a coronavirus test prior to traveling but on Tuesday told tourism agencies to insist to visitors they monitor their own health before traveling after 11 of the 900 Russian tourists that arrived at a northern beach resort last week tested positive upon arrival.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 06:12AM ET</span>","Bahrain's Sheikh Khalifa quelled opposition unrest, defended dynastic rule","DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain's veteran prime minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa quashed repeated opposition unrest in almost half a century in office and was a fierce critic of the Arab Spring, saying it had brought Arabs only ""death, chaos and destruction"".
The world's longest-serving prime minister, Sheikh Khalifa died on Wednesday in Mayo Clinic hospital in the United States, Bahrain's state news agency said.
Running Bahrain day-to-day since 1971, Sheikh Khalifa was seen for decades as the dominant personality in the government, a foe of Iran, friend of Saudi Arabia and defender of the state's Al Khalifa dynasty.
Reviled by the mainly Shi'ite Muslim opposition as a leading barrier to reform in the Sunni-ruled kingdom, Sheikh Khalifa advocated a tough response to public protest that saw thousands of opposition activists jailed. Critics say many were tortured or mistreated in detention, a charge Bahrain strongly denies.
Prime Minister since Bahrain's independence from Britain, Sheikh Khalifa, 84, the uncle of King Hamad, routinely dismissed the opposition's description of him as the man most responsible for recurrent deadlock in political reform efforts.
He told Germany's Der Spiegel in 2012: ""Believe me, if my position alone were the reason for the unrest, then I would have already stepped down from my office last year. But this is just a further excuse from the opposition.""
In response to a remark that he had served an unusually long time, he told the magazine: ""So what? Democratic systems are very different ... Why can't we also be different?""
Bahrain, an ally of fellow Sunni monarchy Saudi Arabia and home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet, has seen periodic unrest since mostly Shi'ite demonstrators took to the streets in February 2011 to call for greater democracy. Many also called for Sheikh Khalifa's resignation. 
STERN RESPONSE TO UNREST 
Authorities quelled the 2011 protests and accused Shi'ite Gulf power Iran of stirring up the unrest -- a charge Tehran and the opposition deny. Sheikh Khalifa said those who called for violence in Bahrain were terrorists backed by Iran and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah, charges they denied.
The Bahrain opposition complains of discrimination against Shi'ites in areas such as work and public services, and demands a constitutional monarchy with a government chosen from within a democratically-elected parliament. 
The government denies discrimination.
Sheikh Khalifa's supporters say he did more than anyone to turn Bahrain from virtual dependence on oil as a major source of income into a banking and financial centre and one of the Middle East's biggest aluminium producers.
But his stern response to pro-democracy protests in Bahrain in 2011 -- and criticism of similar unrest across the Arab world -- underlined what for many was the defining characteristic of his career, namely a stalwart defence of dynastic rule.
""Do you think I am happy to see what has happened in all these countries?"" he told Der Spiegel. ""This is not an 'Arab spring'. Spring is connected with flowers, happy people and love -- not death, chaos and destruction.""
An international inquiry said in November 2011 that 35 people died in Bahrain's revolt. The dead were mainly protesters but included five security personnel and seven foreigners.
Following the uprising, mass trials became commonplace and scores of people were imprisoned including leading opposition figures and human rights activists. Many others fled abroad.
'SYSTEMATIC' ABUSE
Critics said the prime minister bore some responsibility for security force abuses in 2011 alleged by rights groups, because these appeared to be systematic behaviour by the state.
Reconciliation talks between the authorities and the opposition failed to defuse tensions, and mistrust between the opposition and the Al Khalifa remains high. 
In 2016 a court dissolved the main Shi'ite opposition group al-Wefaq, accusing it of helping to foster violence and terrorism, in an escalation of a crackdown on dissent.
A turning point in Sheikh Khalifa's career came with Iran's 1979 revolution, led by Shi'ite clerics seen by Bahrain and other Gulf states as expansionist firebrands out to weaken rival Sunni powers, in particular Bahrain with its Shi'ite majority.
But in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, Bahrain maintained good ties with both countries despite the discovery of what Bahrain said a pro-Iranian coup attempt in 1981, and another in 1986.
As prime minister, Sheikh Khalifa ran daily affairs of state under the late Emir Sheikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, who died in 1999, and under his successor King Hamad.
He stood firm against a four-year bout of unrest by Shi'ites in 1994, sending thousands of activists to jails. The protests, demanding political and economic reforms, abated in 1998.
He also cultivated good ties with Arab states. But in June 2017 Bahrain, along with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar, accusing it of backing terrorism. Qatar denies the charge and accuses its neighbours of seeking to curtail its sovereignty.
In May 2019, Sheikh Khalifa telephoned Qatar's emir to mark the first day of Ramadan in a rare interaction between the feuding group of nations, although the government in Manama signalled no change in political stance.
Sheikh Khalifa suffered a serious heart attack in 1985. After a second heart attack in July 1988, he underwent a triple by-pass operation in the Saudi capital Riyadh.

He received medical treatment in Germany several times in 2020.

The protesters briefly chanted ""Nikol is a traitor!"" before they were detained in the capital Yerevan, but others started gathering to protest after their arrest, witnesses said.
Street rallies are banned under martial law, imposed by Armenia because of the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and until recently fully controlled by ethnic Armenians. 
Seventeen political parties scheduled the rally after calling on Pashinyan to quit on Tuesday over the terms of the ceasefire deal, which froze territorial gains made by Azeri forces in fighting that broke out on Sept. 27.
Among those arrested were Gagik Tsarukyan, leader of the opposition Prosperous Armenia Party, according to a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post by Hripsime Arakelian, a member of his party.
The agreement was celebrated as a victory in Azerbaijan, which had been trying to regain land lost during a war in the 1990s. In Armenia, it triggered unrest from crowds who stormed government buildings on Monday and branded the deal a betrayal.

961,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Thousands of refugees flee to Sudan from Ethiopia conflict,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Thousands of Ethiopian refugees were fleeing into neighbouring Sudan on Wednesday as federal troops continued to battle local forces in the closed-off northern Tigray region. 
With outsiders barred and communications down, the status of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's week-long offensive against regional rulers the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was unclear.
Half a dozen journalists have been arrested, according to the country's human rights commission, raising fears of an erosion of recent democratic advances in Ethiopia.
Security sources and state media have spoken of hundreds of deaths in the mountainous state of more than 5 million people, where federal warplanes have been bombing arms depots as soldiers fight on the ground. 
Given deep antipathy between the Tigrayans and Abiy, who comes from the largest Oromo ethnic group, and ethnic frictions elsewhere around Ethiopia, there are fears of civil war and knock-ons around the Horn of Africa region.
Ethiopia reached a peace agreement with neighbouring Eritrea two years ago, for which Abiy won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, but both governments have long-held grudges against the TPLF.
Abiy's government also has troops deployed in Somalia helping to combat an Islamist insurgency.
United Nations sources told Reuters the Tigray conflict had already sent 6,000-7,000 people fleeing across the border into Sudan, with Khartoum fearing that number could balloon. 
""The number is increasing around the clock,"" said Alsir Khaled, an official from the Sudanese refugee commission.
Abiy, who at 44 is Africa's youngest leader, launched operations in Tigray last week after accusing the local government there of attacking a military base.
INTERNATIONAL ANXIETY
The United Nations, African Union and others are calling for a ceasefire, but diplomats and security officials say Abiy is intent on crushing the Tigrayan leaders and not ready to mediate.
""We won't rest till this junta is brought to justice,"" he tweeted late on Tuesday. 
A former soldier who once fought alongside Tigrayans against Eritrea, Abiy took office in 2018 after a Tigrayan-led government had dominated politics since rebels from their region toppled Marxist military rule in 1991.
But his efforts to open up a repressive political climate also led to an explosion of ethnic problems, with hundreds killed and hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes in clashes over the last two years.
The government of Oromiya, the largest of Ethiopia's nine ethnic-based regions with around 35 million people, called for protests against the TPLF and against an armed group from Oromiya.
In Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, an explosion under a bridge blew off a man's leg, but there was no indication it was related to the Tigray fighting. 
The state-appointed human rights commission said that six Ethiopian journalists had been arrested. 
""We reiterate our call for the respect of due and fair process,"" commission head Daniel Bekele tweeted. 
The Committee to Protect Journalists, a global watchdog, warned of ""a dangerous reversal"" of the Abiy government's past steps to improve press freedom. 
Spokesmen for the federal police and Attorney General's office, where the prime minister's spokeswoman referred Reuters for comments, did not respond to calls and messages.
Quelling Tigray may be tough for Abiy, experts say. 
The TPLF are a battle-hardened movement, having been at the forefront of the 1998-2000 war with Eritrea and the defeat of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. Their forces and militia are well-armed and number up to 250,000 men. 

Though there was little detail from the ground, the fighting will be worsening the humanitarian situation in Tigray, where there were already 100,000 internally displaced people and 600,000 dependent on food aid.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (Reuters) - On the roof of an apartment block in one of Gaza's most crowded cities, two lion cubs prowl among the water tanks and dine on slaughtered chickens as children take selfies.
It is a bizarre sight even in a war-scarred Gaza Strip that has become accustomed to the unaccustomed.
The 75-day-old male and female cubs, Fathy and Filisteen (Palestine), have become playthings for bored neighbours of their owner, bakery owner Naseem Abu Jamea, though animal experts expressed concern on hearing of the situation.
""It is my hobby, I was attached to them and I love to have them,"" Abu Jamea, 27, told Reuters. ""I hope one day I can have my own zoo."" 
Abu Jamea said he got the cubs from a local zoo but declined to give further details.
As his nephews, brothers and neighbours' children played with the animals, he dismissed the risks.
""When you raise them as babies, a harmony will grow between both of you and (they) will not hurt you,"" he said.
However, Amir Khalil, a veterinarian who has led several trips to Gaza by the animal welfare organisation Four Paws to rescue mistreated zoo animals, said he was alarmed to hear about the cubs.
""I advise the Gaza authorities to take away those lions,"" Khalil told Reuters by phone from Pakistan.
""At the age of six months a lion becomes more dangerous as his size gets bigger and his muscles become stronger."" 
ANIMAL WELFARE
Khalil also feared for the cubs' own welfare.
""Raising lions at home may deprive them of health, sufficient food and medical care and may result in acute health problems. Especially to the muscles, joints and bones,"" he said.
Gaza's zoos complain of a fall in visitor numbers, which harms their ability to feed and look after the animals properly.
Even before the coronavirus pandemic, they had to contend with an Israeli-led land, sea and air blockade, which controls the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, a 360 sq. km coastal strip run by the Islamist militant group Hamas. 
Israel says the closures are to protect it from militant attacks. Palestinians say they amount to collective punishment. 
Asked about the lion cubs, Hassan Azzam, director of veterinary services at Gaza's agriculture ministry, said they had received no complaints, but that the ministry intended to investigate.
""Palestinian law does not permit raising wild animals in people's homes,"" he told Reuters. ""Wild animals must be kept in proper zoo houses.""
The lion cubs' neighbours seemed untroubled.

""I am not afraid. On the contrary, we are proud that we have lions in our area,"" said Wissam Al-Qarra.

LONDON (Reuters) - A newly unveiled nude female statue in London meant to honor feminist pioneer Mary Wollstonecraft has been targeted by unknown critics who stuck black tape on its breasts and pubic area, draped it in COVID masks and dressed it in a T-shirt.
The sculpture by British artist Maggi Hambling, unveiled on Tuesday, angered feminists and other critics who said the naked figure drew attention to the female body instead of honouring the 18th century intellectual's achievements and influence.
A key theme in the backlash was that men commemorated with monuments are usually depicted clothed. Hambling responded by saying that she wanted to move away from the tradition of ""male heroic statuary"" to create something timeless, not historical.
Having received ample media attention all day, the statue was visited in the evening by unknown people who taped up its private parts and placed two face masks, of the kind worn to curb the spread of COVID-19, on its shoulders, like a cloak.
An image of the statue with the tape and masks circulated on social media late on Tuesday. By Wednesday morning, the items had been removed, but a Reuters photographer saw two women drape the figure in a T-shirt and place a placard next to the plinth.
The placard displayed a quote from Wollstonecraft's groudbreaking work of 1792, ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"", reading: ""Strengthen the female mind by enlarging it, and there will be an end to blind obedience.""
Cast in silvered bronze, the sculpture depicts a small naked female figure with a conventionally beautiful physique rising out of a much taller abstract figure resembling a vertical swirl.
""DISRESPECTFUL""
Shortly after the two women covered it in a T-shirt, with some difficulty due to the height of the swirl, a third woman removed the garment using a stick. Groups of onlookers argued about the merits of the statue and of its critics.
The commotion reflected the strong opinions voiced by critics of the statue since it was revealed.
Feminist writer Caroline Criado Perez, who successfully campaigned for a statue of 19th century suffragist Millicent Fawcett to be erected in Parliament Square, called the new sculpture ""disrespectful to Wollstonecraft"".
Caitlin Moran, author of the bestseller ""How To Be a Woman"", raged against the statue on Twitter, arguing that ""being hot and naked so regularly defines women that to deliberately play into it does nothing but reinforce tired old tropes"".
Simon Schama, author of numerous bestsellers on history, wrote: ""Always wanted a fine monument to Wollstonecraft. This isn't it.""
The statue also had its defenders.
Cultural historian Fern Riddell said it reminded her of ""how women are created in images that never match their thoughts"", and said people could interpret it however they wanted.

Kang Kyung-wha met a number of Biden allies in Washington, including Democratic Senators Chris Coons and Chris Murphy and John Allen, chief of the Brookings Institution think tank, after arriving there for talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. 
Kang said she conveyed the South Korean government's commitment to advance the alliance and work together on North Korea issues, while hearing about Biden's views on foreign policy issues during the meetings.

The office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said separately on Wednesday it was arranging a phone call between Moon and Biden for Thursday. 
Kang said she was looking forward to having early formal discussions after Biden is sworn in, building on past experiences working with Democratic administrations. 
Kang also met incumbent White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien. They discussed bilateral, regional and global issues including the election for chief of the World Trade Organisation and agreed to maintain close cooperation until the new administration comes in, she said.

The longtime foes held three rounds of talks last month hosted by the United Nations at a peacekeeper base in southern Lebanon which the U.N. and the United States had described as ""productive"".
But sources had said that gaps between the sides remain large after they each presented contrasting maps outlining proposed borders that actually increased the size of the disputed area.
Israel already pumps gas from huge offshore fields but Lebanon, which has yet to find commercial gas reserves in its own waters, is desperate for cash from foreign donors as it faces the worst economic crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war.
The meetings are the culmination of three years of diplomacy by Washington, and follow a series of deals under which three Arab nations - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan - agreed to establish full relations with Israel.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's biggest opposition party on Wednesday said it would not recognise this week's general election and urged authorities to hold another vote, with the help of the powerful military. 
The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) urged a re-run of Sunday's vote as soon as possible, with the military's cooperation, ""in order to have an election that is free, fair, unbiased and free from unfair campaigning"".
The USDP call came as Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party looked on course for its second successive election sweep, after partial results on Wednesday indicated a commanding lead and wins in more than 80% of the parliamentary seats that have been declared. 
The NLD has claimed a resounding based on its own unofficial tally. 
Nearly a third of the contests have been formally announced and the latest official results take the NLD's seats in the bicameral legislature to 130 of the 158 declared, compared with 15 for the USDP.
The NLD won by a similar margin in the last election in 2015, which was the first vote since the end of nearly 50 years of strict military rule and quasi-military rule.
The NLD needs 322 seats to be sure of forming the next government.
The USDP alleged irregularities like poor-quality ballot boxes and envelopes, problems with advanced voting and government cash handouts it said amounted to NLD bribes.
It also complained about celebratory gatherings by NLD supporters it said breached novel coronavirus restrictions.
'EVIDENCE'
The NLD said such complaints were to be expected but it demanded proof of any wrongdoing.
""There will always be some people who say it is not fair,"" said NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt. ""They must present evidence for their accusations."" 
The election commission was not immediately available but it was scheduled to hold a news conference later on Wednesday. 
The election was seen as a referendum on Suu Kyi's fledgling democratic government, which is hugely popular at home but its reputation abroad has collapsed due to accusations of genocide against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, which it denies. 
Despite the emergence of new parties, experts saw the election as a straight choice between the NLD and the USDP, the political juggernaut created by the military junta before it started the transition towards a civilian-led democratic system.
International and local observers have said the election went smoothly without major irregularities. The U.S-based Carter Center said on Tuesday that voting was conducted positively in 94% of stations visited. 
The election commission, which is appointed by the president, was criticized before the vote over alleged errors in voter lists, censorship of broadcasts by opposition parties, and the cancellation of voting in areas affected by insurgencies.
Among the critics was the military's commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who said there were ""unacceptable mistakes"" ahead of the polls, underlining tension between the civilian government and the military, which has a quota of house seats and control of several ministries.

China urges the United States to ""stop any kind of official exchanges or contacts with Taiwan and stop elevating substantive relations"", he added.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry hailed the talks.
""This dialogue is a major milestone in Taiwan-U.S. economic relations. It demonstrates that Taiwan and the United States will develop closer and broader cooperation under their global economic strategic partnership,"" it said in a statement.
Krach was the most senior State Department official to visit Taiwan in four decades after being named to head a new bilateral economic dialogue with the island.
Taiwan has long sought a free trade agreement with the United States.
While U.S. President Donald Trump is a popular figure in Taiwan due to his administration's support for the island, Taipei's government has moved to assure people that President-elect Joe Biden will continue that backing.
""There may be changes in the U.S. government and personnel, but we are confident in the continued development of Taiwan-U.S. relations,"" Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday, according to her Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party.

As many as 50 people have died in recent days in attacks by fighters linked to Islamic State, local media including Mediafax and The Pinnacle News have reported.
Violence had surged this year in Cabo Delgado - a province that borders Tanzania and is the site of a multi-billion dollar natural gas project - alarming governments across southern Africa.
U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called for an investigation in a statement late on Tuesday.
""The Secretary-General is shocked over recent reports of massacres by non-State armed groups in several villages ... including the reported beheading and kidnapping of women and children,"" his spokesman said.
There was no immediate response from the government.
Militants seeking to carve out an Islamist state started attacks in Cabo Delgado in 2017. They have seized key towns for brief periods and hit military targets this year.
In September, Amnesty International accused Mozambican soldiers of committing atrocities during a crackdown on the violence, but the defence ministry dismissed the reports, saying militants regularly impersonated soldiers.

Russia is already testing two vaccines against the virus and is on the cusp of registering a third. It is rolling out its Sputnik V vaccine for domestic use despite the fact that late-stage trials have not yet finished.
""The head of the Turkish health ministry expressed interest in organising production of the Sputnik V vaccine at Turkish pharmaceutical manufacturers' facilities, after toxicology studies have been carried out, as stipulated by local legislation,"" the health ministry said in a statement. 
Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko assured his Turkish colleague of the readiness to organise such tests, the statement said. 
The Turkish health ministry declined to corroborate that claim, but Health Minister Fahrettin Koca confirmed that the two men had held a phone call in a tweet posted late on Tuesday.
""We exchanged views on issues in the health sector on which we are cooperating, namely the COVID-19 vaccine efforts, and international operations that we are part of,"" Koca said.

Turkey has reported nearly 400,000 confirmed COVID-19 patients with more than 11,000 deaths since March. In July, the government changed its daily tallies to only report the number of symptomatic patients, in a move critics said was hiding the true scale of the outbreak in the country.

Japan uses kanji characters from China along with phonetic Japanese script, especially for names, and the characters can sometimes be read in different ways. In Umeda's case, his first name, Yutaka, can also be pronounced ""Jo,"" while his surname becomes ""Baiden.""
Over the last few days, Umeda has become a media and internet sensation.
""I'm really surprised,"" Umeda told Reuters. ""I was told I was in the news in Japan but I was in Tokyo yesterday, and I heard from people that I made news in the U.S. too.""
People have suggested Umeda fly to Washington to meet Biden or invite him to Yamato, but for now, Umeda said he will content himself with a congratulatory letter.
""To me, the president of the U.S. was someone far away,"" said Umeda. ""But coincidentally, because our names are phonetically the same, I feel much closer to him when I watch his speeches and videos.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Poppies illuminated the sails of the Sydney Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) House at dawn on Wednesday as Australia marked the 102nd anniversary of Remembrance Day.
As the sun rose, a lone bugler played the Last Post to mark the end of World War I and to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the line of duty.
The guns fell silent at 11 a.m. on November 11, 1918 after more than four years of warfare. Once the conflict was over, the poppy was one of the few plants to grow on the barren battlefields, and the flower has become a symbol for remembering those who died.
Services were also held across Australia although COVID-19 restrictions limited crowds.
In Canberra, Prime Minister Scott Morrison laid a wreath at a Remembrance Day service in Canberra.

More than 60,000 Australians lost their lives and more than 150,000 were wounded, taken prisoner or gassed during WW1, says the Australian War Memorial.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - On the 16th anniversary of the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, preparations were underway on Wednesday for the funeral of his former confidant and spokesman Saeb Erekat, who died after contracting COVID-19.
Erekat, 65, served Arafat and his successor President Mahmoud Abbas as chief negotiator. As Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization, he was one of the most impassioned defenders of the Palestinian quest for statehood over decades of conflict with Israel. 
On Wednesday, Abbas will lay a wreath at a memorial ceremony in the West Bank city of Ramallah - the seat of the Palestinian government. Abbas has declared three days of national mourning for the veteran Fatah loyalist he called ""brother"" and ""friend."" 
A long-time resident of Jericho, the largest Palestinian city in the Jordan Valley, Erekat died on Tuesday after announcing on Oct. 8 that he had contracted the coronavirus. 
A lung transplant three years ago left his immune system compromised, and his condition deteriorated. He was taken to an Israeli hospital in Jerusalem three weeks ago and was pronounced dead on Tuesday after multiple organ failure.
After the Ramallah memorial, a funeral convoy is due to drive from Ramallah to Jericho where his body will be carried in procession to a town mosque for prayers, as is typical in Muslim funerals. 
A military ceremony is then expected to lead the procession to a nearby cemetery.
The sombre events take place as Palestinians mark the death of Arafat, who died in Paris on Nov. 11, 2004 and was flown back to Ramallah for burial, with a huge crowd in attendance as his body arrived by helicopter. 
The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said that a rally would be held in Arafat's memory, and that participants would have to abide by coronavirus precautions.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia should change the lyrics of its national anthem to honour its indigenous people, the leader of the country's most populous state said on Wednesday, becoming one of the most prominent lawmakers to endorse such an alteration. 
Australia's national anthem includes the line ""we are young and free"". But New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said this should be changed to ""we are one and free"" as it fails to recognise that indigenous Australians are the oldest continued civilization in the world.
""I think it's about time we recognise the tens of thousands of years of the first nations people of this continent,"" Berejiklian told the Australian Broadcasting Corp television. ""We're tens of thousands of years old when it comes to human inhabitants. It's just a small gesture."" 
Each year Australians have a national holiday on Jan. 26, marking the date the ""First Fleet"" sailed into Sydney Harbour in 1788, carrying mainly convicts and troops from Britain. Some indigenous people refer to Australia Day as ""Invasion Day"".
Australia has struggled for decades to reconcile with Aborigines, who arrived on the continent some 50,000 years before British colonists, but the country has seen a renewed focus on Indigenous empowerment amid the Black Lives Matter movement. 
Indigenous Australians, about 700,000 people in a population of nearly 26 million, have tracked near the bottom in almost every economic and social indicator. 
""Whether we can become 'one' will depend on whether symbolic changes to the anthem are accompanied by practical change at the national level,"" said Anne Dennis, chairwoman of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's spy chief has proposed a summit of the leaders of the United States, Japan and the two Koreas during the Tokyo Olympics next year, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported on Wednesday.
Park Jie-won made the proposal in Japan, where he arrived on Sunday for his first trip as head of the National Intelligence Service (NIS) aimed at improving relations strained by a feud over compensation for Koreans forced to work for Japanese firms during its 1910-45 colonial rule.
Park suggested the summit during a Tuesday meeting with new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, saying it could take up the issues of North Korea's denuclearisation and the abduction of Japanese citizens by North Korean agents, the newspaper said.
Japan's relations with both North and South Korea have long been difficult, largely because of its colonisation of the Korean peninsula.
Park conveyed South Korean President Moon Jae-in's willingness to normalise ties with Japan, for which he said there needed to be some Japanese apology or expression of regret for the wartime forced labour, the newspaper said. 
""The Olympics could provide a chance to resolve the bilateral issue of forced labour and regional issues including North Korea's nuclear programmes and Japanese abductees,"" the newspaper cited Park as saying.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Park had suggested that Moon and Suga announce a new declaration to build on a 1998 joint pledge of a ""future-oriented relationship"". 
""Both leaders are strongly willing to resolve current issues,"" the news agency quoted Park as saying.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's attendance at such a summit would be a landmark.
The NIS declined to comment on the reports.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato did not elaborate on the summit suggestion in a briefing but said Suga told Park that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the United States was essential in dealing with North Korea.

Kato cited Suga as demanding that South Korea ""create an opportunity to restore healthy relations between Japan and South Korea, which have been in a very severe situation"".

Ambassador Martha Barcena published a series of talking points on Twitter titled ""Position of the Government of Mexico"" containing the new language. It was not immediately clear if the choice of words signalled a shift in Mexico's official stance.
The Democrat former vice president secured the presidency by winning Pennsylvania on Saturday, but Republican President Donald Trump has so far refused to concede, and is pursuing lawsuits in several states in a bid to hold on to power citing ""illegal"" ballots. State officials have said there were no significant irregularities in the Nov. 3 election. 
The Mexican foreign ministry did not offer specific comments on the ambassador's statement, with a ministry official saying it had been issued by the embassy.
In response to questions from Twitter users, Barcena later gave several synonyms for the word ""prospective.""
""Prospective can be translated in several ways, presumed is one of them, virtual would be another, probable, eventual, future,"" she said in a Tweet. 
So far, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has held back from congratulating Biden for winning the election even as government leaders in many countries sent their best wishes.
""This principled position underlines the respect for the U.S. political system and institutions and for both the Democratic and Republican parties as well as for President Donald Trump and prospective President-elect Joseph Biden,"" Barcena said in the document.
""Mexico is ready to engage in a constructive spirit with the future U.S. administration, based on the enduring ties of friendship and neighborliness that bind our two nations.""

Lopez Obrador has reiterated he would not recognize the election winner until legal disputes were resolved, but said he had ""no problem"" with Biden.

(Reuters) - Nicaragua's parliament voted on Tuesday to amend the Central American country's constitution to allow life sentences for hate crimes despite criticism from human rights organizations who contend it will be used to target political opponents.
Legislators loyal to President Daniel Ortega pushed through the amendment with 70 votes in favor and 16 against. The maximum sentence has been 30 years for hate crimes. 
The change still needs to be approved in a second legislative period, with the next starting on Jan. 10.
""It's a reform with political interests to persecute opponents,"" said Gonzalo Carrion, a lawyer for the Nicaraguan human rights collective Never+. 
Wilfredo Navarro, a lawmaker with Ortega's ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front, said the revision would allow life imprisonment for those who commit ""serious crimes when they occur in hateful, cruel, degrading, humiliating and inhuman circumstances"" and prompt a national outrage.
Rosario Murillo, Nicaraguan vice president and wife of Ortega, announced weeks ago that the government planned to propose an amendment to Article 37 after a series of rapes and femicides caused a national outcry. 
Later, she said the article would also cover crimes motivated by hate against the government. 
Opposition protests against Ortega erupted in 2018, leading to the deaths of more than 300 people, most at the hands of the police and armed civilians loyal to the government, human rights organizations said.
Over the past three weeks, Nicaragua's parliament also passed two separate laws intended to prevent external funding for political organizations as well as to regulate publications in the media and on social networks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York City man has been criminally charged with sending death threats on social media, in part because he was unhappy with Democrat Joe Biden being declared the winner of the presidential election, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday.
Members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force arrested Brian Maiorana, 54, at his Staten Island home on Tuesday after he posted threats directed towards protesters, politicians and law enforcement.
At a late afternoon hearing, a federal judge in Brooklyn ordered Maiorana detained while his lawyer works on a bail proposal, which the government plans to oppose.
The lawyer, federal public defender James Darrow, declined to comment after the hearing.
Prosecutors said Maiorana's online threats began before the election, including when he said on Oct. 19 it had ""come to the point where pipe bombs need to be thrown into these mobs of potentially non violent violent protesters.""
The complaint said Maiorana posted on Nov. 5 that people claiming to be Democrats should be exterminated, and appeared to respond on Nov. 8 to celebrations of Biden's victory by posting: ""All right thinking people need to hit the streets while these scumbags are celebrating and start blowing them away.""
Maiorana also appeared to refer that day to New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, by posting: ""As the Jew Senator from Jew York said nothing is off the table ... We blow up the FBI building for real. All the alphabet agencies assassination will become the new normal.""
At the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Artie McConnell said Maiorana's alleged threats were ""not simply idle chatter,"" citing weapons found at his home through a search warrant.
""This defendant greatly exceeded what can be characterized as political hyperbole,"" McConnell said.
He also said Maiorana, a registered sex offender in New York, was a flight risk and presented an ""irremediable threat"" of danger to the community.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A Canadian man charged with killing 10 people and the attempted murder of 16 in a 2018 van attack in Toronto told a court he should not be held ""criminally responsible"" as the five-week trial kicked off on Tuesday.
Alek Minassian, 28, rented a van and drove it onto the sidewalk along Yonge Street in North York, a suburb just north of Toronto, striking passersby. He later told police detectives he was motivated by a desire to punish society for his perceived status as an ""incel"" - short for involuntary celibate - because he believed women would not have sex with him.
Minassian has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder. He has not denied his role but told the court via Zoom that he was entering a plea of ""not criminally responsible"" on all counts.
""On a warm spring afternoon... numerous pedestrians were out along Yonge Street enjoying the sun when their worlds were shattered by the actions of Mr. Minassian,"" prosecutor Joe Callaghan told the court. ""Mr. Minassian will be admitting that he intended to kill the 10 people who died, the murders were planned and deliberate, and that he in fact did cause the death of those people.""
Callaghan added that psychological and psychiatric experts will be called to present evidence.
The trial began with a reading of the agreed statement of facts - a chronological timeline of the events, including Minassian's conversations with police detectives after he admitted his guilt.
The hearings are scheduled to finish on Dec. 18. The trial is being livestreamed in the Metro Toronto Convention Centre for the public to attend, with social distancing and mask requirements in place.

The National Security and Investment Bill will give ministers new powers to scrutinise and intervene in ""malicious"" foreign investment, addressing long-standing concerns that some deals could compromise security or vital infrastructure.
""Hostile actors should be in no doubt – there is no back door into the UK,"" said business minister Alok Sharma.  
""This bill will mean that we can continue to welcome job-creating investment to our shores, while shutting out those who could threaten the safety of the British people.""
Earlier this year, ministers blocked Chinese communications firm Huawei from parts of its communications network over concerns about spying. In 2016 Britain delayed a nuclear power project in England over concerns about Chinese state funding.
Both episodes drew criticism from Beijing but highlighted an increased wariness over threats to national security, and doubts about existing legislation which provides only limited scope for government intervention. 
The United States and Australia have recently upgraded oversight powers.
The new bill will ask companies to seek approval for any potential deal - from takeovers to asset and intellectual property sales - involving a range of sectors, such as defence energy and transport or artificial intelligence and encryption.
The government said the vast majority of these transactions would be approved without intervention, and sought to offset concerns about the creation of barriers to investment by promising decisions within 30 days.
The laws would explicitly state that national security is the only ground for intervention.

Firms which fail to comply could be fined, and executives could be jailed. Any transaction where notification is deemed mandatory would be declared legally void if procedures are not followed.

The program, slated to begin in February, will be composed of new mental health teams from the Fire Department's Emergency Medical Services unit and will target two ""high-need"" neighborhoods, which were not identified. 
""For the first time in our city's history, health responders will be the default responders for a person in crisis, making sure those struggling with mental illness receive the help they need,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.
The move comes as New York and other large cities seek to reform their police departments after the May death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis and other incidents sparked nationwide protests.
The national debate over how to improve policing has in part centered on how to prevent mental health calls from escalating into violent confrontations with police.
Currently, New York police officers and emergency medical technicians respond to nearly all 911 calls involving a mental health issue, regardless of whether there is a risk of violence.
De Blasio and the city's first lady, Chirlane McCray, said in the statement that the responders would have the expertise to deal with a range of situations, including suicide attempts, drug abuse and physical problems which can mask mental health issues.
The mental health responders will be accompanied by a police officer if there is a weapon involved or ""imminent risk of harm,"" the statement said.

The city is modeling the trial after programs in other cities, including one in Eugene, Oregon, in which unarmed mental health professionals respond to mental health calls instead of the police.

(Reuters) - A convicted murderer who is scheduled to be executed by the U.S. government next month appealed to President Donald Trump for clemency on Tuesday, citing regrets by five jurors from his trial who now say he should instead serve life in prison.
At trial in 2000, a jury found Brandon Bernard and an accomplice, Christopher Vialva, guilty of carjacking and murdering Todd and Stacie Bagley, married Christian youth ministers from Iowa, on the Fort Hood army base in Texas the previous year.
Five of the nine surviving jurors submitted sworn affidavits or statements to be included in Bernard's clemency petition in which they said that Bernard's lawyers did a poor job defending a client who was 18 at the time of the crime.
""To me, it seemed like his attorneys were going through the motions and nothing more,"" Calvin Kruger, the jury foreman, wrote in his affidavit.
Bernard's lawyers say information showing that Bernard held a lowly position in the gang that killed the Bagleys was not presented to the jury, and that he was not present when the Bagleys were abducted by Vialva and forced into the trunk of their car. Later, after Vialva, who was 19 at the time, shot the couple in the trunk, Bernard followed Vialva's orders to set the car on fire, according to trial records.
While all five jurors still agree that both Bernard and Vialva were guilty, they said that Bernard did not seem to have intended to kill the Bagleys. His execution is set for Dec. 10.
Vialva was executed with lethal injections in September, the first Black man to face the punishment since the Trump administration resumed carrying out the death penalty in the federal justice system after a 17-year hiatus. During that time, some states have continued to carry out executions of people convicted of capital crimes in state courts.
One of the five jurors, Gary McClung, said in a telephone interview that he regretted his vote for the death penalty for Bernard, whom he thought got swept along in a crime he did not set out to commit.
""I had misgivings from the beginning,"" he said. ""I just didn't stand for my convictions as I should have initially during the trial, and it's something that has weighed on my conscience for a good while.""
He said the two defendants had strikingly different demeanors during the trial: Vialva was ""pretty harsh, sometimes a little indifferent to what was going on;"" Bernard, he said, ""seemed pretty broken"" and ""overwhelmed by the whole situation.""
The U.S. Department of Justice, which fields clemency petitions on the president's behalf, did not respond to a request for comment.
The family of the Bagleys could not be reached for comment, but the mother of Todd Bagley, Georgia Bailey, said in a statement after Vialva's execution that Trump's resumption of executions had brought her family closure and justice. 

The U.S. government has executed seven men this year, more than twice as many as all of Trump's predecessors combined going back to 1963. Three more executions are scheduled in November and December, including that of Bernard.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United Nations and rights groups have urged a probe into the use of firearms by Mexican police this week to disperse a feminist protest in Cancun over the recent death of a young woman.
Footage apparently taken by a protester of Monday night's protest in the tourist hotspot was widely shared on social media. The video shows a group of demonstrators trying to tear down plywood at the entrance of an office building before volleys of semi-automatic gunfire send them running for cover.
Reuters spoke to a journalist present at the protest who described scenes similar to those shown in the video. 
At least two journalists were injured during the protests, said Mexico's Human Rights Commission. It did not say if the injuries were related to the gunshots. 
The commission called for a ""prompt"" investigation and urged the government not to allow the use of live rounds by police at protests.
It was not immediately clear if the gunshots during the protest were live fire, rubber bullets or blanks.
Cancun police chief Eduardo Santamaria was fired on Tuesday, the city's mayor said on Twitter. Quintana Roo state police chief Alberto Capella said his officers were not involved in what he described as a ""shameful"" use of force that would be investigated. 
The Mexico office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned what it termed ""excessive use of force"" at the protests and urged an independent investigation. 
Mexico's interior ministry has also called for an investigation into the ""repression and armed aggression.""
The protest was sparked by the death of Bianca 'Alexis' Lorenzana, 20, whose body was found mutilated over the weekend in Cancun ""with clear traces of violence,"" according to local media. 
A protest movement in Mexico demanding more action against the murder of women has been gaining momentum in recent months, with demonstrators taking over buildings and sometimes clashing with police.
Selene Hidrogo, a journalist covering Monday's protest for outlet Sipse TVCUN, said the police appeared to target reporters.
""They hit me on the right hand and broke my cellphone,"" Hidrogo told Reuters. ""The aggression was directly against us, against journalists who were broadcasting the demonstration live.""

Cancun police did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Hidrogo's allegation.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala has ended rescue operations at the site of a huge landslide believed to have killed scores of people in Queja village during tropical storm Eta last week, the country's national disaster agency CONRED said on Tuesday.
Storm Eta’s torrential downpours toppled trees, engorged swift-moving rivers, and ripped down parts of a mountainside above the village of Queja in the central Guatemalan region of Alta Verapaz, burying people in their homes.
President Alejandro Giammattei on Friday indicated up to 150 people could have been buried in the Queja landslide but CONRED's own figures show eight confirmed deaths in Queja, while another 88 people are missing in the village.
""Today in the morning the decision was made to suspend the search due to soil saturation,"" CONRED spokesman David de Leon told Reuters, referring to the dangerous soil conditions for excavation teams on the ground.
Alberto Ical, a community leader in Queja, said the villagers want to continue with the search as the local custom is to observe the bodies of the dead family members before burying them.
""I don't want the bodies to stay there,"" said Ical, who told the surviving Queja residents that CONRED will not permit the search to go on.
""What we want is to continue searching and be able to locate everyone, although we know that it will not be possible,"" he added.
Nationally, the confirmed death toll from Eta stood at 44 and there were 99 missing people across Guatemala, according to CONRED figures.
The devastating weather front caused by Eta was one of the worst storms to hit Central America in years, spreading destruction from Panama to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Mexico.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>",Hungary government proposes constitutional amendment mandating Christian gender roles,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's government proposed a constitutional amendment on Tuesday requiring children to be raised with a Christian interpretation of gender roles, as Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling nationalists turn to anti-LGBT rhetoric to shore up support.
The draft amendment submitted to parliament by Justice Minister Judit Varga declares that children must be guaranteed an ""upbringing based on values stemming from Hungary's ... Christian culture.""
""The basis for family relations is marriage,"" it says. ""The mother is a woman, the father is a man.""
It also says Hungary ""protects children's right to the gender identity they were born with,"" using language consistent with a government campaign to outlaw transgender identities.
Orban's nationalist Fidesz party and his political allies, the small Christian democratic party KDNP, face elections in early 2022 with their grip on power potentially weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact.
In past years, Orban's government has mostly focused on condemnation of immigration in Europe. But it has increasingly turned to anti-LGBT rhetoric as the pandemic hit the economy, following the example of the ruling nationalist PiS party in nearby Poland which made homophobia the centrepiece of its campaign in an election this year.
In May, Hungary banned gender changes in personal documents. It has also taken issue with children's books that portray diversity positively.
In part of Tuesday's bill explaining the justification for the new constitutional amendment, the government said it was needed to protect children ""from new, modern ideological trends in the Western world ... that pose a threat to children's right for healthy development"".
Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjen said last week that Hungary should enshrine in its constitution a ban on ""gender propaganda"" to protect children. He also said gays should not be allowed to adopt children and start families.

The Hungarian LGBT community fears now that it could become the target of concerted political attacks ahead of the 2022 election.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's military-backed opposition said on Tuesday there had been ""many contentious events"" during a parliamentary election two days ago which the ruling party says it won by a landslide, but offered no immediate evidence of violations.
Than Htay, leader of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), said in a video on the party's official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that it was pursuing legal options and urged viewers to send in evidence of ""illegal acts"".
""There were many contentious events during the whole voting process, whether in line with the law or not, and more facts are coming out,"" he said, without specifying. 
""We will continue to work according to the law to receive the result our supporters want.""
Sunday's election was seen as a referendum on the fledgling democratic government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD), which remains very popular at home but has seen its overseas reputation battered by accusations of genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority, which it denies.
The NLD has said it won more than the 322 seats in parliament needed to form a government based on data compiled from reports by party agents at polling stations nationwide.
The election commission is yet to announce a final tally, but the several dozen seats it has announced so far put the NLD comfortably ahead.
The commission, which is appointed by the president, was criticized in the run-up to the vote over alleged errors in voter lists, censorship of broadcasts by opposition parties, and the cancellation of voting in areas affected by insurgencies.
A commission spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. 
The NLD said it was ready to cooperate if any reliable evidence of violations was provided.
""We are also ready to resolve it according to the law,"" party spokesman Myo Nyunt said by phone.
International and local observers have said the election went smoothly without major irregularities.
The U.S-based Carter Center said on Tuesday entry for observers was restricted in three centres where votes were being tabulated but that voting was conducted positively in 94% of stations visited.

Candidates can file objections within 45 days of the results to tribunals appointed by the election commission, but cannot appeal the judgments at an independent court.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 02:56PM ET</span>","Ethiopia's Tigray conflict worsens, refugees flee to Sudan","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Refugees fled to Sudan on Tuesday and the African Union appealed for a ceasefire in a north Ethiopian region where Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is waging a military offensive against local leaders defiant of his authority.
About 2,500 Ethiopians have escaped across the border to Sudan from fighting in the restive Tigray region, with the exodus likely to swell fast, an official said.
Hundreds have died in air strikes and fighting amid fears that Ethiopia could slide into civil war given deep animosity between the Tigrayans and Abiy, who comes from the largest Oromo ethnic group. 
With access blocked to Tigray and communications largely down, it was hard to verify the state of the conflict. 
State media said federal forces had captured Humera airport, near the borders with Sudan and Eritrea, along with a road leading from the town. The Ethiopian Press Agency posted photos that it said showed federal soldiers, backed by forces from the neighbouring Amhara region, at the airport. 
However, Humera residents were going about their lives normally, according to a communications office of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which governs the state of more than 5 million people. 
State affiliated broadcaster FANA said Ethiopia had arrested 17 military officers for disrupting communications systems used by federal forces in Tigray, exposing them to potential harm.
Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, ordered air strikes and sent troops into Tigray last week after accusing the TPLF of attacking a military base. Tigrayans say Abiy's government oppresses and discriminates against them and behaved autocratically in postponing a national election.
ERITREA ALLEGATION
In a potential major escalation, Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael said the Eritrean government of President Isaias Afwerki had sent troops across the border to attack local forces in support of the federal push. 
But he gave no proof and Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed denied it. ""We are not part of the conflict,"" he told Reuters.
Eritrea and Ethiopia signed a peace deal two years ago, but Afwerki's government remains hostile to the Tigrayan leadership after its role in a devastating 1998-2000 war. 
Reuters reporters on Monday travelling in Tigray and Amhara saw trucks packed with militia fighters and pickups with mounted machine-guns rushing to the frontline for the federal government. 
Warplanes have bombed arms depots and other targets, both sides say, while aid workers and security sources have reported heavy fighting on the ground.
Military and security sources in Amhara, on the side of the federal troops, have spoken of 500 deaths on the Tigrayan side and hundreds also from the national military.
The state-affiliated Fana broadcaster said federal troops had killed 550 Tigrayan ""extremists"" while another 29 members of local special forces and militia had surrendered. 
The AU bloc called for peace talks and an end to hostilities. But Ethiopia said mediation was only possible if military hardware in Tigrayan hands was destroyed, federal officials were freed from custody and regional leaders arrested.
WAR FEARS 
The 44-year-old Abiy is Africa's youngest leader and won his Nobel prize for democratic reforms and for making peace with Eritrea. But his militancy against Tigray has alarmed diplomats and a full-scale war could further damage an economy already reeling from the coronavirus crisis. 
A former soldier who once fought alongside Tigrayans against Eritrea, Abiy took over in 2018 after a Tigrayan-led government had dominated politics since rebels from their region toppled Marxist military rule in 1991. 
But his attempts to open up a repressive political climate also led to an explosion of ethnic problems, with hundreds killed and hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes in clashes over the last two years.
Abiy believes he can quell the Tigrayan leadership militarily, diplomats told Reuters, though they are a battle-hardened group from the 1998-2000 war with Eritrea and the defeat of dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991.
TPLF forces and militia allies number up to 250,000 men and possess significant hardware, experts say.
""Operations will cease as soon as the criminal junta is disarmed, legitimate administration in the region restored, and fugitives apprehended & brought to justice — all of them rapidly coming within reach,"" Abiy tweeted on Tuesday.
The TPLF has called him ""merciless"" with air strikes.
Redwan Hussein, spokesman of a newly-established State of Emergency Task Force for the Tigray conflict, said federal soldiers had been forced to retreat over the border to Eritrea before regrouping and returning to fight local forces.

He acknowledged that Tigrayan troops had control of a compound of the Ethiopian military's powerful Northern Command in Mekelle, the capital of Tigray.

996,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 02:56PM ET</span>","Report into disgraced ex U.S. cardinal shows failings by popes, top clerics","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY, (Reuters) - Pope John Paul II promoted ex-U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick in 2000 despite rumours of his sexual misconduct, a Vatican report found, one of a series of failings by popes and officials who let him rise through the ranks regardless of repeated allegations against him.
McCarrick, a highly influential figure in the American Church, was expelled from the Roman Catholic priesthood last year after a Vatican investigation found him guilty of sexual crimes against minors and adults and abuse of power.
With testimony from 90 witnesses and dozens of documents, letters and transcripts from Vatican and U.S. Church archives, the 450-page document offers a remarkable reckoning by an institution known for its secrecy, portraying a man long able to convince superiors of his innocence.
Even the current pope, Francis, was questioned for the report, which the Vatican said he ordered to be published ""for the good of the universal Church"".
The report said that ""credible evidence"" that the former archbishop of Washington, D.C. had abused minors when he was a priest in the 1970s did not surface until 2017.
But it said the U.S. Church hierarchy was aware of consistent rumours that after McCarrick became a bishop in the early 1980s he preyed on adult male seminarians.
""During extended interviews, often emotional, the persons described a range of behaviour, including sexual abuse or assault, unwanted sexual activity, intimate physical contact and the sharing of beds without physical touching,"" the report's introduction says.
McCarrick has said he had no recollection of child abuse and has not commented publicly on allegations of misconduct with adults. Now aged 90, he is living in isolation.
Barry Coburn, McCarrick's lawyer, said in an email that there would be no comment.
DENIAL 'WAS BELIEVED'
The report has gained significance since it was ordered by Pope Francis in 2018 and one of McCarrick's alleged victims has since sued the U.S. Church in a trial expected to home in on what officials knew.
Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the abuse tracking group BishopAccountability.org, called it ""the most significant document on the abuse crisis to come from the Church,"" particularly the revelations about Pope John Paul.
But she said Pope Francis should have done more and the report lets him ""off the hook.""
The report said there was ""no credible information"" suggesting misconduct before McCarrick's appointments in the 1980s, but that in hindsight, the Vatican's investigations of later allegations against McCarrick were of a ""limited nature"".
In 1999, Cardinal John O'Connor advised Pope John Paul II that it would be imprudent to promote McCarrick because of ""rumours"" of sexual misconduct with seminarians in Metuchen and Newark dating back to the 1980s.
An investigation by the Vatican ambassador to the United States, requested by John Paul, ""confirmed that McCarrick had shared a bed with young men"" but said there was no certainty that he had engaged in sexual acts.
On Aug. 6, 2000, McCarrick wrote to Pope John Paul's private secretary to rebut the allegations made by Cardinal O'Connor.
""McCarrick's denial was believed,"" the report said.
In November, 2000, Pope John Paul appointed McCarrick archbishop of Washington, D.C., one of the most prestigious posts in the U.S. Church. There, he hobnobbed with world leaders and shone as a star fundraiser for the Church.
The report said investigations in 2019-2020 determined that three of the four bishops had provided ""inaccurate and incomplete"" information about McCarrick's sexual conduct. The omissions ""impacted the conclusions of John Paul II's advisors and, consequently, of John Paul II himself,"" the report said.
It went on to say the Vatican never received a direct complaint from a victim and it was plausible, given the information it had, to ""characterise the allegations against him as 'gossip or 'rumours'"".
DEFENDING A SAINT
John Paul died in 2005 and was declared a saint in 2014. The report said his willingness to believe McCarrick's denial was likely influenced by his experience in his native Poland when the communist government used ""spurious allegations against bishops to degrade the standing of the Church"".
The Vatican, then under newly-elected Pope Benedict XVI, told McCarrick he should withdraw as bishop after it became aware of more information from a victim identified as ""Priest 1"", the report said.
Benedict accepted McCarrick's resignation in 2006.
In 2008, three top Vatican officials suggested the pope approve a canonical investigation ""to determine the truth and, if warranted, impose an 'exemplary measure'"".
A Vatican official instead asked McCarrick to ""maintain a lower profile and minimise travel for the good of the Church"". But, because there were no ""explicit instructions from the Holy Father"" (Pope Benedict), McCarrick continued public activities.
The report says Benedict likely rejected the idea of an investigation because there were ""no credible allegations of child abuse"", because McCarrick had sworn on his oath as a bishop that he had not sexually abused anyone and ""there was no indication of any recent misconduct"" (with adults).
After he was elected in 2013, Pope Francis became aware of ""allegations and rumours"" concerning McCarrick's past behaviour, the report said.
""Believing the allegations had already been reviewed and rejected by Pope John Paul, and well aware that McCarrick was active during the papacy of Benedict XVI, Pope Francis did not see the need to alter the approach that had been adopted in prior years,"" the report says.
Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, a former Vatican ambassador, has accused Francis of allowing McCarrick to continue his travels and lifting ""sanctions"" he said were imposed by Benedict. The Vatican has said there were no formal sanctions.

The report said no documentation of any abuse by McCarrick was given to Pope Francis before 2017, when McCarrick was accused of abusing a minor in the 1970s, leading to the Vatican investigation that led to his expulsion from the priesthood.

Hanan al-Barassi, a lawyer and outspoken critic of abuses in areas controlled by eastern military leader Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), was shot dead in public, rights groups said. 
""Barassi has been publicly vocal about cases of alleged assault and rape of women in Benghazi in which she implicated members of the armed groups in Benghazi, and she also alleged financial fraud,"" said Hanan Salah, senior Libya researcher for New York-based Human Rights Watch. 
Amnesty International said Barassi and her daughter had received death threats. It noted that her social media page had said on Monday she planned to release video exposing corruption within Haftar's family. 
The LNA said in a statement it had summoned security chiefs in Benghazi and ordered them to investigate the assassination. 
The U.S. embassy in Libya expressed shock over the killing. ""The era of missing and murdered civilians must come to an end now,"" it said in a statement.
Libya has been split since 2014 between the LNA and an internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli in the west. Turkey supports the GNA, while the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt back the LNA. 
In June the GNA repelled a 14-month LNA assault on Tripoli, and front lines have solidified near Sirte on Libya's central Mediterranean coast. 
Last month the United Nations brokered a ceasefire and on Tuesday a joint military commission from both sides met at a new Sirte headquarters to detail ways to implement it. 

The progress in military talks comes as the United Nations presses political talks in neighbouring Tunisia involving 75 representatives, to discuss a path to elections and the formation of a new unified transitional government.

WASHINGTON/WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will push ahead on Tuesday with longshot legal challenges to his election loss, as Republican U.S. lawmakers and state officials defended his right to do so.
Pennsylvania Republican state lawmakers called for an audit of results in the state that on Saturday enabled Democrat Joe Biden to secure the more than 270 votes in the Electoral College he needed to win the presidency.
Biden, the president-elect due to take office on Jan. 20, 2021, also leads Trump in the popular vote by more than 4.6 million votes, according to the latest count of ballots.
Trump has made baseless claims that fraud was marring the results. The count has been delayed by a surge in mail-in ballots prompted by voters' desire to avoid infection from the coronavirus pandemic.
Judges have tossed out lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia, and experts say Trump's legal efforts have little chance of changing the election result.
The leading Republican in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Monday carefully backed Trump, saying that he was ""100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities,"" without citing any evidence.
McConnell's comments represent the thinking of most Senate Republicans for now, said a senior Senate Republican aide. ""The position is tenable until it isn't and might last for a week or two before it becomes untenable,"" the aide said.
The dispute has slowed Biden's preparations for governing. 
A Trump appointee who heads the office charged with recognizing election results has yet to do so, preventing the Biden transition team from moving into federal government office space or accessing funds to hire staff.
The General Services Administrator Emily Murphy, appointed by Trump in 2017, has yet to determine that ""a winner is clear,"" a spokeswoman said. Biden's team is considering legal action. 
BARR MOVE PROMPTS RESIGNATION
U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Monday told federal prosecutors to ""pursue substantial allegations"" of irregularities of voting and the counting of ballots. 
He also told them that ""fanciful or far-fetched claims"" should not be a basis for investigation. His letter did not indicate the Justice Department had uncovered voting irregularities affecting the outcome of the election.
Richard Pilger, who for years has served as director of the Election Crimes Branch in the Justice Department, said in an internal email he was resigning from his post after he read ""the new policy and its ramifications"". 
The previous Justice Department policy, designed to avoid interjecting the federal government into election campaigns, had discouraged overt investigations ""until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded.""
Biden's campaign said Barr was fueling Trump's far-fetched allegations of fraud.
""Those are the very kind of claims that the president and his lawyers are making unsuccessfully every day, as their lawsuits are laughed out of one court after another,"" said Bob Bauer, a senior adviser to Biden.
A bipartisan group of six former U.S. Justice Department officials blasted Barr's move.
""The voters decide the winner in an election, not the President, and not the Attorney General,"" wrote the group, which includes Don Ayer, a deputy attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush. 
""We have seen absolutely no evidence of anything that should get in the way of certification of the results, which is something the states handle, not the federal government.""
REPUBLICANS REMAIN LOYAL 
Although a few Republicans have urged Trump to concede, the president still had the support of prominent party leaders who had yet to congratulate Biden.
Trump's campaign on Monday filed a lawsuit to block Pennsylvania officials from certifying Biden's victory in the battleground state, where the Democrat's lead grew to more than 45,000 votes, or nearly 0.7 percentage points, with 98% of ballots counted on Tuesday morning.
It alleged the state's mail-in voting system violated the U.S. Constitution by creating ""an illegal two-tiered voting system"" where voting in person was subject to more oversight than voting by mail.
""The Trump campaign's latest filing is another attempt to throw out legal votes,"" Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said on Twitter.
Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer led a group of Republican state lawmakers on Tuesday in calling for a bipartisan investigation with subpoena powers to see if the ""election was conducted fairly and lawfully."" 
Asked about any evidence of fraud, Keefer told reporters, ""We've just gotten a lot of allegations,"" adding that ""they're too in the weeds"" for her to know more without investigating.

Biden will give a speech on Tuesday defending the Affordable Care Act, the landmark healthcare law popularly known as Obamacare, as the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on a lawsuit backed by the Trump administration to invalidate it.

GRAN CANARIA, Spain (Reuters) - More than 2,000 African migrants were stranded in a dockside camp on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria on Tuesday after a wave of arrivals overwhelmed local authorities' capacity to house them.
""It's a disaster. There's a huge spike in arrivals and the situation is very complicated,"" said Cristina Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the national government on the islands.
Across the Canary Islands archipelago, more than 2,600 people arrived in 73 boats between Saturday and Monday, she said, adding that the 1,461 who arrived on Saturday marked a new daily record.
Seeking relief from the sun blazing down on the port of Arguineguin in the south of Gran Canaria, some of the migrants fashioned shelters out of Red-Cross blankets propped up by plastic fencing. 
With reception centres across the islands stretched to capacity, some have been stuck on the dock for days.
Seaborne migration to the Canaries, which lie around 100 km (60 miles) off Morocco's west coast, has jumped ten-fold this year, with some 15,404 people braving the perilous Atlantic crossing. 
After 2006, when more than 30,000 people reached the shores of the Canaries, Spain stepped up security and numbers dwindled to a few hundred per year.
But heightened security in the Mediterranean combined with economic strife from the coronavirus pandemic has left more migrants attempting the Atlantic route. 
Underscoring the danger of the crossing, which is usually made in rudimentary wooden fishing boats, some 140 Europe-bound migrants died after their boat caught fire and capsized off the coast of Senegal at the end of October .

In the harbour at Arguineguin, several similar rickety boats wallowed low in the water, struggling to stay afloat after reaching European shores.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin has brokered a Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal that locks in territorial gains for Turkey-backed Azerbaijan. In doing so, he has thwarted a stronger Turkish presence in a region Moscow views as its backyard.
Six weeks of heavy fighting between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces over the enclave have tested Moscow's influence in the South Caucasus, a swath of the former Soviet Union it views as vital to defending its own southern flank. 
Three previous ceasefires, at least one of which was brokered by Moscow, fell apart. Azerbaijan accidentally shot down a Russian military helicopter, killing two. And Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan backed the Azeri offensive militarily and diplomatically and tried to gatecrash mediation efforts.
In the end though, Putin has achieved a more than two decades Russian dream of inserting Russian peacekeepers into Nagorno-Karabakh on a renewable five-year basis and, for now, kept Turkish troops, who will instead help run a ceasefire monitoring centre outside the enclave, out. [nL1N2HW0GT]
That expands Russia's military footprint, putting an apparent end to geopolitical competition between Moscow and Ankara of the kind that continues to play out in Syria and Libya.
With the wider deal, Putin has staved off a full Turkish-backed Azeri takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh however, which ethnic Armenians forces said was just days away from falling, and reaffirmed Russian influence in the region by brokering a deal which excluded Turkey as a signatory.
""Today's deal...in many ways addresses core Russian interests in the conflict, and is perhaps the best outcome (at least in short term) Moscow could get,"" said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank.

Ankara has said the ceasefire deal was a ""sacred success"" for its ally Azerbaijan [nL8N2HW1IO] while Erdogan, who has yet to comment, has described Ankara's support for Azerbaijan as part of Turkey's quest for its ""deserved place in the world order"". [nL1N2GV05O]
Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director of the German Marshall Fund research group in Ankara, said the Russian presence in the area was a negative for Turkey and Azerbaijan but the Azeri position was now far stronger than six weeks ago.
""Azerbaijan has obtained a great success in the field and this is consolidated by this ceasefire,"" he said. 
Ankara did not need permission to send its forces to observe the ceasefire, Unluhisarcikli said, although it was unclear if Moscow had accepted that.
Eurasia Group said Erdogan would probably not be too upset by the way things had turned out. 
""Turkey maintains some role, but it is clearly secondary to Russia’s,"" it said in a research note. ""Erdogan is likely fine with this. His military support for Azerbaijan made a big difference at relatively little cost to Turkey, and it granted Ankara a nationalist win and some leverage with Russia.""
That said, Russia's peacekeepers, armed and backed with armoured vehicles, freeze the conflict, making it impossible for Azerbaijan or Turkish-backed proxy forces to advance further.
There's another potential dividend for Moscow, which has a defence pact with Armenia and maintains a military base there. 
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan swept to power on the back of 2018 street protests which forced the then government to resign.
Moscow has had an uneasy relationship with Pashinyan ever since, seeing him as less pro-Russian than his predecessors on key policy issues and as someone who unseated a generation of Kremlin loyalists.
The Karabakh deal, seen by many Armenians as a sell-out, puts Pashinyan under pressure, with opposition political parties calling for him to resign. 
Angry crowds stormed government buildings overnight, including his official residence which was looted, and Pashinyan was forced to deny allegations he had fled the country. 
Moscow would be unlikely to mourn his downfall if it happened. 
But even as Moscow savoured its diplomatic coup, Mark Galeotti, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said the ceasefire deal flattered to deceive.

""This is managing decline, a Russia that in regional terms is strong in capacities, weak in will, trying to make the best of a situation, and in the process disappointing its allies and doing nothing to deter its challengers,"" he wrote in a Moscow Times opinion piece.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 12:21PM ET</span>","Head of Peru's Congress assumes presidency, vows to respect election timetable","By Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - The head of Peru's Congress, Manuel Merino, was sworn in as the Andean nation's president on Tuesday, and vowed that elections set for April would stand after lawmakers removed Martin Vizcarra on corruption charges.
Merino, a businessman and member of the center-right Popular Action party, will serve as interim president until July, following the already-scheduled April 11 elections. 
In a speech after the swearing-in ceremony, Merino, 59, sought to temper widespread concerns of pending political chaos in the world's No. 2 copper producer, promising an orderly transition and elections.
""There is nothing to celebrate here, this is a difficult moment for the country,"" Merino told Peruvians. ""Our first commitment before the country is to confirm our democratic convictions, and our respect for the election timetable."" 
Merino's ascension to the presidency comes the day after Peru's opposition-led Congress voted overwhelmingly to oust the centrist Vizcarra late on Monday after an impeachment trial over allegations of bribery, the second such trial he has faced in two months.
Vizcarra's abrupt removal means he joins a long list of Peruvian politicians ensnared in allegations of corruption, piling a political crisis atop the economic recession induced by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The former president, an anti-corruption crusader, continued to question Congress' decision to oust him on Tuesday, telling reporters that Merino's government ""raised concerns"" because it lacked legitimacy. 
Several protests involving hundreds of people continued in cities throughout the country in support of Vizcarra. In downtown Lima, the capital, police fired tear gas at protesters who waved banners and signs and demanded Vizcarra's return.
The political shock hit the country's economy as well.
Peru's sol currency plummeted to an 18-year low in early trading on Tuesday, and dollar-denominated government bonds also tumbled on the news of Vizcarra's removal, with market watchers concerned of a further drift toward populism. Most analysts had anticipated Vizcarra would survive the impeachment vote.
The country's Congress, led by Merino, has twice approved the partial withdrawal of private pension funds amid the pandemic that has ravaged the economy, unnerving some analysts and politicians who accuse him of a populist bent.
In his speech, Merino told Peruvians he would focus on taming the coronavirus outbreak in the coming months, as well as righting the country's ailing economy.
Former soccer goalkeeper George Forsyth, the favorite among prospective candidates for the presidency in recent polls, nonetheless urged vigilance during the transition.
""This is a coup in disguise. We need calm, but also a lot of citizen surveillance,"" he said on Twitter.
CONFIEP, a trade group for private business, urged authorities to assure prompt and transparent elections.

""We appeal to calm and resilience so that this episode does not take away from the efforts that all Peruvians have made to overcome the pandemic,"" the union said on Twitter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday imposed Iran-related sanctions on six companies and four people, accusing the network of supplying sensitive goods to an Iranian military firm in the Trump administration's latest move to increase pressure on Tehran.
The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement accused the companies and individuals of facilitating the procurement of sensitive goods, including U.S.-origin electronic components, for Iran Communication Industries, an Iranian military firm blacklisted by Washington and the European Union.
The firm produces military communication systems, avionics and missile launchers, among other items, the Treasury said.
Tuesday's action, taken under an authority that imposes sanctions on weapons of mass destruction proliferators and their supporters, freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.
""The Iranian regime utilizes a global network of companies to advance its destabilizing military capabilities,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.
""The United States will continue to take action against those who help to support the regime’s militarization and proliferation efforts,"" he added.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have soared since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by President Barack Obama and began reimposing U.S. sanctions that had been eased under the accord.
The move blacklisted Iran-based Hoda Trading; Hong Kong-based Proma Industry Co., Ltd.; DES International Co., Ltd.; Brunei-based Soltech Industry Co., Ltd.; China-based Naz Technology Co., Ltd.; and Iran-based Artin San’at Tabaan Company, as well as several individuals.
The Treasury said the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia was also filing charges by criminal complaint against two companies and one individual that were hit with sanctions in Tuesday's move.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The Danish government put forward hastily drawn up legislation on Tuesday to back up its order to cull all the country's farmed mink, admitting it lacked the legal basis for the measure aimed at preventing human contagion of a mutated coronavirus strain.
Authorities last week embarked on a plan to eliminate Denmark's entire population of 17 million mink, one of the world's biggest, saying the new strain could move to humans and evade future COVID-19 vaccines.
However, the minority Social Democratic government has since drawn fierce criticism from the industry and lawmakers who said the order, which followed earlier culls of infected mink, was illegal and questioned the science behind it.
The World Health Organization has said transmission of the virus between mink and humans was ""a concern"" and British Health Minister Matt Hancock suggested on Tuesday the international community should look again at the industry, alluding to a possible global ban.
China, Denmark and Poland, which ordered testing of its mink on Tuesday, are the largest producers https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-denmark-mink-factb/factbox-some-key-facts-about-the-mink-industry-in-europe-idUKKBN27L1KN of mink pelts, animal rights group Humane Society International - United Kingdom, says.
On Tuesday afternoon, the government presented draft emergency legislation to back up the cull order given last week, proposing a ban on all mink breeding in the country until 2022.
The opposition says the cull of healthy mink should not have been initiated before compensation plans were in place for the owners and workers at some 1,100 mink farms.
The draft bill proposes compensation for farmers who have culled their entire herd by Nov. 16 at a suggested level based on the value of their herd along with consequential losses.
Late on Monday, Environment and Food Minister Mogens Jensen said in emailed comments to Reuters that he regretted ""the lack of clarity"" in the initial instruction, which ordered mink farmers with healthy mink to cull their herds.
On Tuesday, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration apologised to mink farmers in a letter, saying it still recommended the culling, even though current legislation could not force them to go ahead with it. 
Tage Pedersen, head of the Danish mink breeders' association, has urged farmers to continue the cull despite the legal uncertainty, saying the industry, which employs around 6,000 people and exports fur pelts worth $800 million annually, was finished.
""We are still culling,"" said Hans Henrik Jeppesen, whose mink farm is located far away those infected. ""I still think the law will be passed at a later stage.""

The WFP, which has coordinated medical logistics during the pandemic, was named winner of the prestigious award last month in what its boss said was a call to action that no one should go hungry in the world today.
The Nordic country currently imposes a 10-day quarantine on almost all arrivals from abroad, but the 15-20 members of the WFP will be allowed to skip the strictly enforced measure if they test negative for COVID-19 upon arrival.
The exemption was granted following an application from the Norwegian Nobel Institute, home to the independent committee that awards the 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.16 million) prize, which also brings significant global attention for the winners.
""The award attracts significant national and international attention. We want to facilitate it so that the winners can be physically present,"" Norway's Health Minister Bent Hoeie said in a statement.
The Rome-based WFP says it helps some 97 million people in about 88 countries each year, and that one in nine people worldwide still do not have enough to eat.
It also runs a logistics service that has dispatched medical cargoes to over 120 countries throughout the pandemic to help governments and health partners fighting COVID-19.
The remaining Nobel awards - for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics - which are traditionally handed out in Stockholm, have been moved online this year due to the pandemic.

The ceremonies are held every year on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.

Three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday the United States is expected to impose the sanctions as early as next week, coinciding with the one-year anniversary of what may have been the bloodiest repression of protesters in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Iran's judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said the 157 ""security detainees"" were among 2,301 people freed under a pardon by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as part of events marking the anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Mohammad, state media reported.
The 157 suspects had been convicted of ""propaganda against the system, (illegal) assembly and collusion, and taking part in riots"" after being arrested in anti-government protests in recent years, the spokesman said.
Rights groups estimate that thousands were arrested in the 2019 protests, which broke out over gasoline price hikes and quickly turned political, with protesters demanding that top officials step down.
The sources said the sanctions had been in the works for months and were the latest in a long series of U.S. penalties imposed on Tehran by U.S. President Donald Trump after he withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in 2018.

Virgilio Maganes, 62, based in the province of Pangasinan, northwest of Manila, was shot six times and died at the scene, they said in a statement. 
The Presidential Task Force on Media Security described the killing as ""an act of cowardice"" and vowed to hunt down those responsible. 
Maganes had survived the previous attempt on his life in November 2016 by playing dead. 
""We demand that the authorities work fast to solve his death, which could be related to the botched attempt on his life,"" the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) said in a statement.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said both his murder and the 2016 attack would be investigated to establish whether they were linked to his work as a journalist.
Despite its reputation for having one of Asia's most liberal media scenes, the Philippines is one of the world's most deadly countries for journalists, with at least 190 killed in the past 35 years. Provincial broadcasters are among those most targeted.

Europe, she said, should take the initiative, with an offer to work with the new U.S. administration, stressing it would not mean a return to the agenda of five years ago.
""Our alliance is based on shared values and history. On a common belief in working together to build a stronger, more peaceful and more prosperous world,"" von der Leyen said in a speech to EU ambassadors around the world.
""These goals will always endure. But in a changing global landscape, I believe it is time for a new transatlantic agenda fit for today's world.""
She congratulated Biden and U.S. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their victory but did not mention outgoing President Donald Trump, who has not conceded to his opponent.
Many European leaders watched with shock as Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate change agreement, slapped tariffs on EU goods and undermined multilateral bodies that America has backed for decades.
Von der Leyen said the EU was looking forward to the United States rejoining the Paris agreement, which Biden has said he will do.
The Commission president said Europe would push for ambitious commitments at next year's international meetings on climate change and biodiversity, adding that the United States was ""well placed to support us"".
It was also time to reverse the trend of weakening multilateral organisations, such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization, with reform where appropriate.
Von der Leyen urged the United States to work with Europe to set global rules for the digital economy, covering illegal hate speech and propaganda, fair competition and data protection.
One thorny area could be taxation of digital services companies. Von der Leyen said she hoped for a global consensus.
G20 finance ministers last month extended until mid-2021 negotiations to update cross-border tax rules after talks ground to a halt amid the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S. reticence.

Mid-2021 had to be an absolute deadline, von der Leyen said, adding that Europe would act if there was no agreement by then.

Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump had made ending the war in Afghanistan a major campaign promise and had said in a Tweet in October that troops could be out of Afghanistan by Christmas, though officials such as his national security advisor have said that they were working to the May 2021 deadline.

Two defendants, a Spaniard and a Moroccan, face charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation, manufacturing and storing explosives, and attempting to cause widespread destruction, according to court documents.
On Aug 17, 2017, a single attacker drove a rented van into crowds on Las Ramblas, causing 14 deaths and injuring over a hundred people. 
The driver of the van also killed another person during his getaway. 
Five militants later drove a car into a crowd in the coastal resort of Cambrils and used knives to attack bystanders, killing a woman and injuring several others, before being shot dead by police. Officers also killed the Barcelona attacker a few days later. 
All charges relate to an accidental explosion on the eve of the attack which occurred in Alcanar, southwest of Barcelona, where explosives and gas canisters had been stored, but not to the Barcelona rampage itself, so the prosecutor does not accuse the suspects of murder.
Others suspected of being linked to the cell, including the imam who reportedly was the mastermind of the attacks, died in the Alcanar blast.

Prosecutors are seeking jail terms of 41 and 36 years for two of the accused and eight years for another Moroccan national who is accused of being an accomplice. They have been in prison pending trial since their arrests in 2017 in connection with the blast.

LONDON (Reuters) - A trove of 240 rare books worth over $3.3 million have been returned to their owners after they were stolen in London by a gang of Romanian men who abseiled down from a warehouse ceiling to avoid setting off alarms.
The men, who were jailed in Britain last month, were dubbed the ""Mission: Impossible"" gang by UK media because of their acrobatic technique, reminiscent of a famous scene in the 1996 movie in which Tom Cruise is lowered into a vault on a rope.
The antique books, considered to be of international cultural significance, include works by English scientist Isaac Newton and Spanish artist Francisco Goya and relating to Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, the Metropolitan Police said.
The burglary took place in January 2017 at a warehouse in Feltham, west London, where the books, which belonged to specialist dealers and had been shipped from Italy and Germany, were being stored on their way to a U.S. book fair.
After cutting holes in the perimeter fence to gain access to the warehouse, the burglars cut holes into skylights in the roof and lowered themselves down onto shelves, thus avoiding activating sensor-based alarms located by the doors.
The burglary was one of 12 carried out by the gang, linked to the Clamparu organised crime group based in the Iasi region in eastern Romania, at various locations around Britain over a two-and-a-half year period.
In meticulously planned operations, gang members would fly into the country to commit burglaries then fly out shortly afterwards. Twelve of them were jailed for terms ranging from three years and eight months to five years and eight months.
London's Metropolitan Police worked on the case for over three years with counterparts in Romania and Italy. 
After the books were discovered hidden underground at a house in Romania, they were transported to the country's National Library in Bucharest, where four of the five owners travelled last month to recover them.

""It was lovely to see the joy of each victim being reunited with these irreplaceable books,"" said Detective Inspector Andy Durham, adding that one of the book dealers, Alessandro Bado, had reacted by declaring with great gusto: ""Tonight we drink like lions.""

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Former Malian president Amadou Toumani Toure, who won acclaim for pursuing democratic reforms before being toppled by a military coup in 2012, has died at the age of 72, an aide said on Tuesday. 
Toure's life, in many ways, symbolised the stop-start nature of democracy in Mali, where his successor Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, was overthrown in another coup this August. 
Widely known by his initials ATT, Toure led an army coup in 1991 against military ruler Moussa Traore after violent anti-government protests. He organised democratic elections the following year and handed over power to a civilian president, earning him the nickname of ""Soldier of Democracy"".
Toure died in Turkey on Monday night, his chief of staff Seydou Cissouma told Reuters, providing no further details.
Jeune Afrique reported the former president was flown to Turkey after undergoing a heart operation in Bamako. 
Senegal President Macky Sall tweeted: ""I am heartbroken to learn of the death of His Excellency Amadou Toumani Toure, former president of Mali. I salute the memory of this renowned figure and present my deepest condolences to his family and the Malian people. May he rest in peace."" 
Toure returned to the presidency in 2002, winning election with 65% of the vote, and was re-elected to a final five-year term in 2007. 
During his presidency, Mali won international praise as a regional model of democracy for its regular elections, relatively free press and institutional reforms. Toure was planning to step down when his second term expired in 2012.
But his authority was weakened by high-level corruption, armed opposition in the desert north and a perception among some Malians that elections were not as free and fair as international observers suggested. 
That ultimately led to the March 2012 coup by mid-ranking officers, followed by the fall of northern Mali to jihadist militants later that year.
Despite French forces' intervention in 2013 to help the government retake the north, militants linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State have since expanded their foothold in Mali and other countries in the region.

Across the country, banners of around 1,700 candidates fluttered from signposts appealing to 4.64 million eligible voters on mostly tribal and family loyalty.
The elections coincide with public discontent as Jordan grapples with its worst economic crisis in many years, with unemployment and poverty aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Politicians appealed to Jordanians to turn out and vote amid widespread apathy and calls for a boycott of what many see as an almost toothless tribal-dominated assembly packed with pro-government loyalists and powerless to make change.
""Our society is tribal but we have to encourage people to vote. I appeal to them to head to ballot boxes to make change,"" Faisal al Fayez, a prominent politician and former premier and royal court chief, told state owned al-Mamlaka television.
Defying liberals and Islamists alike, the government has maintained an election law that under-represents large cities that are Islamist and Palestinian strongholds in favour of sparsely-populated tribal areas which form a bedrock of support for the kingdom's Hashemite monarchy.
Tribalism has been on the rise as a political element in Jordan, blunting the emergence of national parties and curbing the influence of Islamists.
The ballot comes after King Abdullah dissolved parliament in September at the end of its four-year term and ended a debate over holding elections during emergency laws to curb the pandemic that critics said was used to stifle dissent and curb civil liberties. 
Jordan faces the challenge of forging ahead with IMF-guided structural reforms to help recover from the pandemic's impact on its aid-dependent economy. 
The Muslim Brotherhood, the country's main opposition group, say they are participating in the polls even though the electoral law keeps them marginalised to avoid being in the political wilderness and ensure vocal opposition to the pro-Western government.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>","Japan should brace for 'leaderless era' as U.S. turns inward, adviser to PM says","By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - A prominent economic adviser to Japan's prime minister says Tokyo should prepare for a ""leaderless era"" as U.S. global leadership gradually withers, and expand other strategic ties while bolstering its security alliance with Washington.
The prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, wasted little time in congratulating U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on last week's election win over incumbent Donald Trump, despite the latter's refusal to concede, saying he wanted to strengthen the alliance and ensure peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.
But concerns about America's inward turn have simmered in Japan for years, intensifying in the face of China's growing military and economic assertiveness and persisting during the Trump presidency despite comparatively warm ties between the outgoing U.S. leader and Suga's predecessor, Shinzo Abe. 
For Suga adviser Takeshi Niinami, chief executive of drinks giant Suntory Holdings Ltd and a well-known regular on the international business circuit, Biden's promises to restore U.S. ties with international institutions and allies are welcome.
But Niinami expects U.S. influence to keep waning relative to China, as Biden faces deep domestic divisions in America after the election, so Japan must widen its push for multiple partnerships.
""We have to put a footprint in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries and India,"" he told Reuters in an interview, while at the same time ""we must explore further relations with the United States in the security space.""
In a separate statement issued soon after Biden's election victory, Niinami said, ""I believe it is inevitable that U.S. global leadership will wither in the long term.
""Japan must continue deepening the U.S.-Japan alliance but at the same time establish its relationship with the world in order to ready itself for a leaderless era,"" said Niinami.
'LIKE-MINDED NATIONS'
Worries about declining U.S. global influence are not new, but former diplomat Kunihiko Miyake, a foreign policy adviser to Suga, agreed Biden could not ""run away"" from a trend toward U.S. ""neo-isolationism"".
""Orthodoxy is back in Washington and we welcome that, but everything is relative and we need more like-minded nations, not only the United States but also other neighbours in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Miyake said. 
In a clear sign of Japan's aim to expand its network of strategic ties, Suga's first overseas trip after taking office in September was to Vietnam and Indonesia, where he reached agreements to bolster defence ties.
That followed Tokyo's hosting of the Quad grouping of the United States, Australia, Japan and India, which proponents see as a bulwark against Beijing's influence. China has denounced the Quad group as a ""mini-NATO"" aimed at its containment.
Japan must balance its deep economic ties with China with its concerns about Beijing's military assertiveness and worries about such matters as cybersecurity and intellectual property protection that it shares with Washington.
Hawks in Suga's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) want a tougher line on China, but a government source said Suga, a relative novice on foreign policy, was still feeling his way. 
Some conservatives in Japan worry Biden may adopt a softer line toward Beijing than Trump, but others expect little substantive change.

""The way the U.S. describes China (under Biden) might change but the general direction is the same - to make China a responsible partner and competitor,"" said a Japanese government source, speaking on condition of anonymity.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>",Supporters throng airport to welcome back controversial Indonesian cleric,"By Heru Asprihanto
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters gathered at Jakarta's airport on Tuesday to welcome back Rizieq Shihab, a firebrand cleric and Islamist leader, who went into exile in Saudi Arabia after facing charges over sending pornographic messages and insulting state ideology. 
There were chaotic scenes at the airport as his supporters, dressed in white, paralysed the toll road, scrambling to get a glimpse of the cleric and trying to kiss his hand.
Some airlines were forced to reschedule flights. 
""We really miss him because we know he really fights for Islam and the Indonesian nation,"" said Abdul Sobur, 42, who was among the crowd. ""I hope Muslims can unite.""
Rizieq, who was jailed in 2008 on charges of inciting violence and who is head of the hardline Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), became a figurehead for conservative Islam and a politically influential movement that helped bring down Jakarta’s former Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly known as ""Ahok"", who in 2017 was jailed for insulting Islam.
That year, police filed a case against Rizieq over insulting Indonesia's secular state ideology, Pancasila, and breaching pornography laws, after a purported steamy exchange with a supporter that included naked images of a woman was circulated online. 
The cleric left Indonesia in 2017 and police dropped both cases a year later, but he had remained in self-exile in Saudi Arabia until Tuesday. 
Another supporter, Ima Sari Kartika, 39, said she was jubilant the cleric had returned home to the world's largest Muslim-majority nation.

""I have been waiting for his presence among Indonesian Muslims for a long time because Indonesia is the largest Islamic country, so there should be an imam who leads the people here,"" she said.

Yoshihide Suga, who became prime minister in September, announced last month Japan aimed to cut greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 and become a carbon-neutral society in a major shift in the country's position on climate change. 
""I believe the United States will go in the same direction once (the election result) is confirmed,"" Koizumi told reporters.
Biden secured more than 270 votes in the Electoral College to capture the U.S. presidency over the weekend, but incumbent Donald Trump has not conceded the election and is pushing ahead with legal challenges to the results. 
""Japan's cooperation with the United States will be broadened not only in climate change under the Paris Agreement but also in environment as a whole,"" said Koizumi, son of former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi.
The United States formally exited the Paris Agreement last week, fulfilling Trump's years-long promise to withdraw the country from the global pact to fight climate change. 

But Biden has promised to rejoin the pact and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",Remote Canadian town programs radar to spot approaching polar bears,"By Gloria Dickie
Churchill, Canada (Reuters) - Along the frosty coast of Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Bay, hundreds of polar bears have been wandering for weeks, waiting for the wintertime sea ice to form so they can return to hunting ringed seals.
Until then, they represent a danger to the 900 people living in nearby Churchill - a remote, sub-Arctic town in Canada famous for the visiting carnivores.
The town is working on a plan to prevent conflicts between hungry bears and humans, using a new radar system that can watch and warn when a bear approaches and do so in a snowstorm and during the dead of night.
""The radar can see through all of that,"" said Geoff York, senior conservation director at Polar Bears International who has been ""training"" the system's artificial intelligence this year to recognize bears on the tundra near Churchill.
""It's one more way to keep communities or camps safe.""
Next year, the system will be deployed for the first time at a tourist campsite near Longyearbyen, a former coal-mining town on Norway's Svalbard archipelago, where a Dutch man was killed by a polar bear in August.
That bear was shot by authorities to prevent another attack.
As climate change warms the Arctic faster than the rest of the world, the region has been drawing more tourists, at least until the coronavirus pandemic severely restricted travel.
With sea ice breaking up earlier and forming later, ""we're seeing more bears on shore in more places and for longer time periods,"" York said.
""We're setting up this perfect scenario for increased human-bear interaction and increased human-bear conflict. We're trying to get ahead of that.""
Churchill's last bear attack was in 2013, when a wayward animal mauled a young woman walking home from a Halloween party. The woman survived after receiving 28 staples to her scalp. Two bears were killed in response.
LONGER ON LAND
Mounted on the tundra where bears congregate during the migration to the sea ice each year, the bear radar, or ""Beardar"", was adapted from a system designed by a private surveillance firm for military use.
The system's computer algorithm has been learning to distinguish bears from other large objects, including caribou, vehicles and humans.
When the radar detects a bear ambling toward a human settlement, it will alert conservation authorities who then deploy a range of tactics from rubber bullets to helicopters to shoo the bear away.
Otherwise, authorities only know of a bear approaching when a person spots it.
When a two-year-old male bear was seen scrambling over a rocky stretch by the nearby historic Cape Merry battery site in late October, conservation officers deployed a helicopter and for three hours it buzzed in the sky above the bear.
Eventually the animal turned back toward wilder areas.
Churchill's residents are used to living alongside hundreds of bears for part of the year: as a rule, townfolk leave car doors and homes unlocked in case someone needs to take shelter from the animals.
""You're just always aware,"" said longtime resident Joan Brauner. ""I always have a cocker pistol on me whenever I go out.""
A 24-hour hotline receives up to 300 tips on polar bear sightings each year. Rangers patrol the town by truck.
When a bear repeatedly gets too close, it is trapped and transferred to what locals call the ""polar bear jail"" in an old military aircraft hangar until it can be moved to the coast.
""Generally, we handle 30 to 50 bears every season,"" said conservation officer Andrew Szklaruk. As the region continues warming, that number could grow.
POPULATIONS IN DECLINE
Bears rely on sea ice as a hunting platform, waiting by holes in the ice for seals to come up for air.
But as the Arctic has warmed more than twice as fast as the rest of the world over the last three decades, that ice breaks up earlier after each winter and takes longer to form in autumn.
This year's sea ice formation has been particularly slow across the High Arctic due to warmer water temperatures and a record summer heatwave.
In the Hudson Bay area, bears are often staying up to four weeks longer on land than the four months or so they spent there in the 1980s. During that time, they fast and lose about 2 pounds of body fat daily.
""Bears here are not as big as they used to be in their overall frame,"" said Cassandra Debets, an Arctic ecologist at the University of Manitoba.
Because malnourished bears can experience reproductive failure, scientists have projected that polar bears could disappear from the Arctic almost entirely by 2100 as the sea ice continues to diminish with climate change, according to a study published in July in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Four of the 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic and sub-Arctic are already in decline, including the Western Hudson Bay bears, while the status of others remains unknown.
As the Churchill bears wait for the ice this year, one impatient juvenile male checked out the saltwater slush and then returned to the tundra.

Another young male munched on a pile of kelp - a sign of boredom, scientists say. It will be a few more days before the ice is thick enough for him to head out and hunt again.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 01:11AM ET</span>",South Korea sees Biden win as good news for military cost-sharing dispute,"By Hyonhee Shin and Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - With Joe Biden's projected victory in the U.S. presidential election, South Korean officials are expecting a win of their own in a drawn-out, multi-billion dollar dispute with Washington over the cost of thousands of U.S. troops on the peninsula.
Officials and experts in Seoul don't expect Biden to entirely drop the demand that South Korea pay more toward maintaining the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops that are stationed in the country as a legacy of the technically unfinished 1950-1953 Korean War.
But Biden has promised not to use the troop presence to ""extort"" South Korea, and South Korean government sources say they anticipate his administration would agree to a deal close to Seoul's proposal to pay 13% more, or around $1 billion per year. 
Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump demanded much as $5 billion as part of a broader push to get allies to contribute more towards defence.
A Biden campaign spokesman declined to comment, and South Korean officials say it’s unclear how deeply his team has thought about the exact outlines of a new Special Measures Agreement (SMA).
""But the 13% increase discussed in past negotiations could be considered reasonable,"" said one South Korean government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic negotiations.
""We will know more when we actually sit down with their team after the new administration names a new negotiator or reappoints the incumbent, but at least there is more predictability now and a Biden White House wouldn't veto a nearly done deal at the last minute,"" the official added.
In April, Reuters reported Trump had rejected that 13% proposal, which was seen as probably Seoul’s best offer ahead of its parliamentary elections that month.
STRAINED RELATIONS
The impasse has strained the alliance in almost unprecedented ways, experts say. It comes as North Korea pushes ahead with its weapons programmes, including state-of-the-art weapons designed to target South Korea, as well as long-range, nuclear-capable missiles that may now put the entire United States within range.
In early 2019, South Korea and the United States were forced to sign an SMA covering only one year instead of the usual five amid ongoing disagreements. But that short-term deal, under which South Korea agreed to pay 8.2% more, or about 1.0389 trillion won ($920 million) per year, expired earlier this year with no new agreement.
One of the most tangible results of the breakdown in the talks was the roughly 4,000 South Korean workers on U.S. bases furloughed as a result of the failure to reach a deal by an April 1 deadline. 
Eventually those workers were able to return to work under stop-gap agreements, but the ongoing deadlock led U.S. Forces Korea to warn in October those workers could once again be placed on unpaid leave early next year if no agreement is made.
One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S.-South Korea alliance, said the dispute cast a near-constant shadow over many of the two countries' discussions on other issues including North Korea and China.
Trump's view that wealthy South Korea, which has an economy larger than Australia's, is taking advantage of the United States was met in Seoul by a perception that Washington has become a transactional partner with unreasonable demands.
Ahead of the Nov. 3 election, Biden vowed not to use the threat of reducing U.S. troop levels in South Korea as a bargaining chip.
""As President, I'll stand with South Korea, strengthening our alliance to safeguard peace in East Asia and beyond, rather than extorting Seoul with reckless threats to remove our troops,"" Biden wrote in an unprecedented op-ed published on Oct. 30 in South Korea’s Yonhap news agency.
Cho Tae-yong, a former deputy national security advisor who worked with many Biden aides, said issues around U.S. troops and their costs would be ""substantially"" resolved under Biden.

""Biden's victory is a source of relief when it comes to alliance issues,"" he said.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 01:06AM ET</span>",Hong Kong journalist appears in court amid fears over press freedom,"By Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong journalist appeared in court on Tuesday on a charge of making a false statement to obtain data for a documentary on the police's handling of a mob attack, in a case that has stoked concern over press freedom in the Chinese-ruled city.
Bao Choy, 37, a freelance producer with local broadcaster RTHK, was arrested last week in connection with data on vehicle registrations she used for the investigative documentary.
The piece examined the police force's response to the attack in Yuen Long district in July 2019 when more than 100 men in white T-shirts wielding sticks and poles attacked pro-democracy protesters, journalists and bystanders at a train station.
RTHK obtained data on the ownership of some cars that were seen in video footage on the night of the attack in a bid to trace those behind the assault and highlight the police's alleged slow response. According to a chargesheet, Bao made false statements when seeking access to the data.
The police were severely criticised at the time for what pro-democracy activists and human rights groups described as a slack response, with some accusing the authorities of colluding with triad gangsters.
Police have rejected the claims and said their slow response was due in part to protests elsewhere in the city that drained resources that night.
""I understand this incident is no longer a personal matter but a matter related to public interest and press freedom in Hong Kong,"" Bao said outside the court. ""I truly believe I will not walk alone."" 
Supporters hugged Bao as she left the court. Her case was adjourned to Jan. 14. 
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has rejected criticism the arrest represents a crackdown on press freedom in the former British colony. 
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a one country, two systems agreement that promised it wide-ranging freedoms unavailable on the Communist Party-ruled mainland.

The protests last year were fuelled by perceptions that Beijing was tightening its grip on those freedoms, which authorities have denied.

KABUL (Reuters) - The last thing 33-year-old Khatera saw were the three men on a motorcycle who attacked her just after she left her job at a police station in Afghanistan's central Ghazni province, shooting at her and stabbing her with a knife in the eyes. 
Waking up in hospital, everything was dark.
""I asked the doctors, why I can't see anything? They told me that my eyes are still bandaged because of the wounds. But at that moment, I knew my eyes had been taken from me,"" she said. 
She and local authorities blame the attack on Taliban militants - who deny involvement – and say the assailants acted on a tip-off from her father who vehemently opposed her working outside the home.
For Khatera, the attack caused not just the loss of her sight but the loss of a dream she had battled to achieve - to have an independent career. She joined the Ghazni police as an officer in its crime branch a few months ago.
""I wish I had served in police at least a year. If this had happened to me after that, it would have been less painful. It happened too soon ... I only got to work and live my dream for three months,"" she told Reuters. 
The attack on Khatera, who only uses one name, is indicative of a growing trend, human rights activists say, of an intense and often violent backlash against women taking jobs, especially in public roles. In Khatera's case, being a police officer could have also angered the Taliban.
The rights activists believe a mix of Afghanistan's conservative social norms and an emboldened Taliban gaining influence while the United States withdraws its troops from the country is driving the escalation. 
The Taliban are currently negotiating in Doha, Qatar, with the Afghan government to broker a peace deal in which many expect them to formally return to power, but progress is slow and there has been an uptick in fighting and attacks on officials and prominent women around the country.
In recent months, the Taliban have said they will respect women's rights under Sharia law but many educated women say they have doubts. The insurgent group has opposed a reform to add mother's names to identity cards, one of the first concrete stances they have revealed on women's rights as they engage in the peace process.
""Though the situation for Afghan women in public roles has always been perilous, the recent spike in violence across the country has made matters even worse,"" said Samira Hamidi, Amnesty International's Afghanistan campaigner. ""The great strides made on women's rights in Afghanistan over more than a decade must not become a casualty of any peace deal with the Taliban.""
CHILDHOOD DREAM DASHED
Khatera's dream as a child was to work outside the home and after years of trying to convince her father, to no avail, she was able to find support from her husband.
But her father, she said, did not give up on his opposition.
""Many times, as I went to duty, I saw my father following me ... he started contacting the Taliban in the nearby area and asked them to prevent me from going to my job,"" she said.
She said that he provided the Taliban with a copy of her ID card to prove she worked for police and that he had called her throughout the day she was attacked, asking for her location.
Ghazni's police spokesman confirmed they believed the Taliban were behind the attack and that Khatera's father had been taken into custody. Reuters was unable to reach him directly for comment. 
A Taliban spokesman said the group was aware of the case, but that it was a family matter and they were not involved. 
Khatera and her family, including five children, are now hiding out in Kabul, where she is recovering and mourning the career she lost. 
She struggles to sleep, jumps when she hears a motorbike and has had to cut off contact with her extended family, including her mother, who blame her for her father's arrest. She hopes desperately that a doctor overseas might somehow be able to partially restore her sight.

""If it is possible, I get back my eyesight, I will resume my job and serve in the police again,"" she said, adding in part she needed an income to avoid destitution. ""But the main reason is my passion to do a job outside the home.""

Chinese-claimed but democratically run Taiwan says its inability to fully access the WHO, because of China's objections, has created a gap in global pandemic prevention. China and the WHO say that is untrue. 
On Monday, WHO member countries rejected a U.S.-backed appeal on for Taiwan to be permitted at a meeting of its decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA). China had labelled the proposal illegal and invalid.
Speaking to reporters, Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said many countries supported the island's participation in the WHA.
""But China, because of political factors, has obstructed Taiwan, which has prevented the pandemic the best,"" Su said.
""This is not only suppressing Taiwan, it is in fact also damaging to the whole world, creating a rupture in pandemic prevention,"" Su added. ""What China has done will only cause more and more countries and people to stand up and condemn them.""
The WHO says it cooperates with Taiwan on health matters, including on aspects of the pandemic, and that the island has been provided with the help it needs, but that it is up to member states to decide whether to invite it to the meeting.
Taiwan has won praise for its early and effective steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and life there has continued more or less normally.
China says Taiwan can only take part in such international bodies if it accepts that it is part of China, something Taipei's government has refused to do.

Su said that in the face of China's threats, more and more Taiwanese recognise that they are a ""sovereign and independent country and that China is the most unfriendly country towards Taiwan"".

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's Congress ousted President Martín Vizcarra on Monday in an impeachment vote over corruption allegations, prompting immediate tensions in the Andean nation.
Vizcarra said he would accept the Congress vote and would not take any legal action to counter it.
""Today I am leaving the presidential palace. Today I am going home,"" Vizcarra said during a speech late on Monday, surrounded by his cabinet in the courtyard of the presidential residence in downtown Lima.
Head of Congress, Manuel Merino, an agronomist and businessman from the minority Popular Action, is expected to assume the presidency on Tuesday and will remain in office until the end of July 2021, when Vizcarra's term was due to expire.
Merino called for calm after the vote and assured Peruvians that the April 11 presidential election would go on as planned.
""It is already called for,"" he said about the election in an interview with the local station América Televisión. 
In the second effort by lawmakers to remove the centrist Vizcarra in a matter of months, the opposition-dominated Congress put forward 105 votes to oust him over accusations that as a governor he accepted bribes from companies that won public works contracts.
The 105 votes far exceeded the 87-vote threshold out of 130 needed to remove him from office. There were 19 votes against his ouster and four abstentions.
Vizcarra has rejected the corruption allegations as ""baseless"" and ""false."" He warned of ""unpredictable consequences"" earlier on Monday if lawmakers impeached him ahead of the April 11 election, in which he is not eligible to run.

Dozens of people gathered at Plaza San Martín in downtown Lima in support of Vizcarra after the news of his ouster as police officers kept a close eye on the crowd. 
Video circulated on social media showing Congressman Ricardo Burga, who voted in favor of the impeachment motion, being punched in the face by a bystander as he spoke to television reporters. 
Vizcarra, 57, lacked a party in the fragmented Congress, and had a tense relationship with lawmakers, with whom he frequently locked horns over his anti-graft agenda. He dissolved Congress last year after a long-running standoff, a move that prompted criticism by right-wing lawmakers. 
Vizcarra survived a first ouster attempt in September in a separate impeachment trial over alleged links to a case of irregular government contracts with a little-known singer. Only 32 in the chamber voted in favor of his ouster in that vote.
In November, however, lawmakers voted to move forward with a new impeachment trial over accusations that Vizcarra accepted bribes from companies that won public works contracts when he was the governor of the southern region of Moquegua..
Vizcarra's removal could usher in a period of political tensions in the months leading up to elections as Peru is already strained by economic instability and the impact of the pandemic, analysts said. 
""Political turmoil related to the latest impeachment process and corruption allegations add to deep distrust of the political class ahead of upcoming elections,"" international firm Eurasia said in a report earlier on Monday.
'COUP IN DISGUISE'
Vizcarra's government clashed with Merino in recent months over accusations that he tried to invoke the military in his request for Vizcarra's removal. Merino denied any wrongdoing.
Analysts said Merino could push some populist measures in the months leading up to Peru's elections. 
""[Merino] would probably maintain the existing economic policy framework but advance some populist measures as he tries to win public support,"" Eurasia said. 
Lawmakers sympathetic to Vizcarra rejected his ouster and warned that the decision would heighten instability in the Andean country. 
""This is a coup in disguise. We need calm, but also a lot of citizen surveillance,"" George Forsyth, a mayor and one of the early front-runners for the 2021 election, said on Twitter. 
Francisco Sagastegui, a lawmaker with the centrist Partido Morado, called the vote an ""incorrect decision."" 

""We think this is... a decision that adds much more uncertainty, creates problems, and will severely affect our citizens,"" Sagastegui said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on four more Chinese officials in Hong Kong's governing and security establishment over their alleged role in crushing dissent in the former British colony.
The U.S. Treasury and State Department identified the four as Deng Zhonghua, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office; Edwina Lau, deputy commissioner of police in Hong Kong, and Li Jiangzhou and Li Kwai-wah, two officials at the newly established national security office in Hong Kong.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions were for their role in implementing Hong Kong's new national security law. He said they would be barred from traveling to the United States, and any U.S.-related assets would be blocked.
""These actions underscore U.S. resolve to hold accountable key figures that are actively eviscerating the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong and undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy,"" he said in a statement.
None of the four could be reached immediately for comment.
Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said the sanctions were ""absolutely unacceptable, a blatant - and I would use the word 'barbaric' - interference.""
""We are not going to be intimidated,"" Cheung told reporters, speaking at a regular news conference held on Tuesday morning Hong Kong time.
Washington has called China's enactment of a new national security law in Hong Kong this year an unacceptable breach of China's ""one country, two systems"" commitment.
The designations are the first sanctions imposed on China since Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in last week's U.S. election. Biden is due to take office on Jan. 20. Trump so far has refused to concede defeat.
In actions heralding a more authoritarian era for Hong Kong, China opened a new national security office in July, a week after imposing the new national security legislation to punish what it called crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Last month, the U.S. State Department warned international financial institutions doing business with individuals deemed responsible for China's crackdown in Hong Kong that they could soon face tough sanctions.
Washington put sanctions on Carrie Lam, the territory's current and former police chiefs and other top officials in August for what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms in a crackdown on the territory's pro-democracy movement.

Relations between the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, plunged to the lowest point in decades in the run-up to last week's U.S. election. The two sides are at odds on a wide range of issues including China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its treatment of Hong Kong.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - A court in El Salvador has asked the prosecutor's office to investigate whether President Nayib Bukele and his defense minister blocked a judicial inspection of military archives aimed at uncovering evidence of a massacre in 1981.
According to a court document released on Monday, the inspection was connected to a probe of the killing of nearly 1,000 people, around half of them children, in El Mozote during the country's civil war to bring justice for the victims.
El Salvador's government for years denied having perpetrated the slaughter. But in 2012 the government of then-President Mauricio Funes acknowledged the state's role and apologized to the victims' families.
One of the worst tragedies of the war that pitted leftist guerrillas against the U.S.-backed Salvadoran army, soldiers executed unarmed villagers of El Mozote and surrounding hamlets in the eastern part of the country as they searched for guerrillas. 
On June 15, the San Francisco Gotera court in charge of investigating the case ordered a series of legal searches at military headquarters.
But on six different occasions between September and October, soldiers denied Judge Jorge Guzman and a group of experts entry to various facilities.
""Crimes have been incurred by act or omission on the part of the president of the republic and general commander of the armed forces, and the national defense minister, who allegedly gave the order to deny access,"" the court document said. 
The document asked the prosecutor's office to investigate the possible theft, destruction, concealment or displacement of documents.
Bukele said in September military files relating to the massacre had been destroyed and that it was not clear by whom. Bukele promised to ""declassify"" and hand over to the authorities the few documents left.

The president's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is expected to impose sanctions as early as next week on Iranians involved in a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations in Iran a year ago, three sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the sanctions announcement was timed to the one-year anniversary of what may have been the bloodiest repression of protesters in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
One source said next week's designations would be a major action, covering multiple individuals as well as several dozen Iranian entities.
""If true, it will simply be indicative of the desperation of an administration whose hostility towards the people of Iran is well-known,"" said Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York, in an emailed statement. 
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the sanctions likely to be imposed next week.
Citing three Iranian Interior Ministry officials, Reuters previously reported about 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest that started on Nov. 15, 2019. The toll included at least 17 teenagers and about 400 women as well as members of the Iranian security forces and police.
Iran's Interior Ministry has said around 225 people were killed during the protests, which erupted after state media announced that gas prices would rise by as much as 200% and the revenue would be used to help needy families.
The sources, who included one U.S. official and two people familiar with the matter, said the sanctions have been in the works for months and are the latest in a long series of U.S. penalties imposed on Iran by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump two years ago abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and has since restored harsh U.S. economic sanctions designed to force Tehran into a wider negotiation on curbing its nuclear program, development of ballistic missiles and support for regional proxy forces.
One source said Washington would blacklist people involved in the killing of civilians, while a second source said those targeted would include government and security officials.
Several sources played down a media report that the Trump administration planned a flood of sanctions before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. Biden, who was Obama's vice president, defeated Trump in last week's U.S. election.
Biden has said he would return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, under which Tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and other sanctions, if the Iranian government resumes compliance.
""We've been sanctioning Iranian entities nearly every week for the past six months. There's no reason we would put our foot on the brake now, but we're not pushing it down on the gas pedal any further either,"" a Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity.
Two weeks ago, the U.S. Treasury slapped counterterrorism sanctions on key players in Iran's oil sector for supporting the Quds Force, the elite paramilitary arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Analysts said that action, taken ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, was among Trump administration moves seeking to make it harder to lift sanctions if Biden won the White House.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia said they have signed a deal with to end the military conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region after more than a month of bloodshed. 
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan first announced the signing on social media in the early hours of Tuesday and the Kremlin and Azerbaijan's president Ilham Aliyev later confirmed the news. 
""The signed trilateral statement will become a (crucial) point in the settlement of the conflict,"" Aliyev said in a televised online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Putin said Russian peacekeepers would be deployed along the frontline in Nagorno-Karabakh and the corridor between the region and Armenia.
Arayik Harutyunyan, the leader of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that he gave agreement ""to end the war as soon as possible"".
The declaration has followed six weeks of heavy fighting and advancement by the Azerbaijan's forces. Baku said on Monday it had seized dozens more settlements in Nagorno-Karabakh, a day after proclaiming victory in the battle for the enclave's strategically positioned second-largest city.
""The decision is made basing on the deep analyses of the combat situation and in discussion with best experts of the field,"" Prime Minister Pashinyan said.
""This is not a victory but there is not defeat until you consider yourself defeated. We will never consider ourselves defeated and this shall become a new start of an era of our national unity and rebirth."" 
The fighting has raised fears of a wider regional war, with Turkey supporting its ally Azerbaijan, while Russia has a defence pact with Armenia and a military base there.
Azerbaijan says it has since Sept. 27 retaken much of the land in and around Nagorno-Karabakh that it lost in a 1991-94 war which killed an estimated 30,000 people and forced many more from their homes. Armenia has denied the extent of Azerbaijan's territorial gains.
Several thousand people are feared killed in the flare-up of the conflict. Three ceasefires have failed in the past six weeks and Azerbaijan's superior weaponry and battlefield gains have reduced its incentive to seek a lasting peace deal. 
Azerbaijan said on Sunday it had captured Shusha, known by Armenians as Shushi, which sits on a mountaintop overlooking Stepanakert, the city regarded as the enclave's capital by its ethnic Armenian administration.
President Aliyev announced a list of 48 settlements he declared liberated on Monday in several parts of the enclave.
An Azeri defence ministry video posted online showed Azerbaijan's national flag flying over deserted streets in what it said was Shusha.

Armenia disputed that the city had fallen.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A trial began on Monday alleging dozens of journalists, editors and media companies breached an Australia-wide court suppression order in reporting on ex-Vatican treasurer George Pell's child sex abuse conviction in 2018.
Breaches of suppression orders can be punished with up to five years jail and fines of nearly A$100,000 for individuals and nearly A$500,000 for companies.
Pell was convicted in December 2018 of abusing two choirboys but reporting on the trial and the conviction was gagged by the County Court of Victoria to ensure the cardinal received a fair trial on further charges he was due to face.
Overseas publications, including the Washington Post and Daily Beast, reported the news shortly after the verdict. Some of them geoblocked access to Australia, but others did not.
After that, some Australian media published articles saying they were unable to report major news regarding an unnamed high profile figure, flagging that the news was accessible online.
The suppression order was only lifted in February 2019, after the second trial was dropped. Pell's conviction was overturned earlier this year after he served over a year in jail.
Prosecutors in the state of Victoria have charged 10 journalists, five newspaper editors, four online publications and 12 media companies, mainly owned by News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and Nine Entertainment and its Fairfax arm, with breaching the suppression order.
The companies have denied the charges and some of the defendants have refused to admit they knew about the order, prosecutor Lisa De Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) told the court on Monday.
She said, however, emails between reporters and editors showed they were aware of the order.
One editor at The Age said in an email read out in court: ""Regarding the suppressed case, I am totally against publishing this story today, as I have said earlier.""
In reply, one of the defendants in the case, The Age editor Alex Lavelle, said in an email he was sympathetic to her view, but that the stories were everywhere and easily accessible.
""We are not breaching the suppression order, just explaining why we can't report on the story,"" he said in an email.
The trial, being run online due to COVID-19 restrictions, is scheduled to last up to 15 days. None of the defendants were in court on Monday.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate said in a statement published on its website on Monday that nearly 7,000 of the total arrests involved the violation of fishing restrictions. Around 4,000 people were prosecuted for illegal hunting and 3,000 for illegally purchasing, transporting and selling endangered wild animal products.
The procuratorate warned that a large proportion of the illegal wildlife business had shifted online, with traders using e-commerce platforms to sell prohibited wild animals. The ""exotic pet"" trade was also a rising challenge, it added.
China's lucrative and poorly regulated wildlife trade came under the spotlight in January after the first outbreak of COVID-19 in the city of Wuhan was traced to a market selling wildlife products.
Scientists believe the novel coronavirus originated in horseshoe bats and could have infected humans via an intermediary species, with pangolins identified as a potential suspect. 

China's legislature issued a resolution in February that promised to ban the sale and consumption of wild animals, but new legislation is expected to include exemptions for the fur and traditional Chinese medicine trades.

Peers voted on Monday to remove the most controversial parts of the Internal Market Bill, which gives ministers the power to unilaterally rewrite parts of the Withdrawal Agreement Johnson signed with the European Union.
The legislation has prompted the EU to take legal action just as the two sides are locked in negotiations to strike a trade and security deal. But the prime minister has shown no sign of backing down over the plan, which the government has conceded will break international law in a “specific and limited” way.
“How can we reproach other countries -- Russia, China, Iran -- if their behavior becomes reprehensible when we ourselves have such scant regard for the treaties we sign up to?” Michael Howard, who used to lead Johnson’s Conservative Party, asked the Lords. “What sort of a precedent is the government setting?”
Peers voted by 433 to 165 and then by 407 to 148 to remove clauses that would allow ministers to redraw parts of the Withdrawal Agreement.
Johnson has argued the measures are needed to defend the integrity of the U.K.’s internal market, and is likely to overturn the changes to the bill when it returns to the House of Commons. The unelected upper house can only delay the legislation, not block it.
The bill would give ministers the power, if no trade accord is reached, to waive tariffs on goods traveling from the mainland to Northern Ireland, something that would upset the delicate compromise Britain and the EU reached during the negotiations to leave the bloc.
Johnson agreed then to levy tariffs on goods moving into Northern Ireland that were at risk of being moved south and into the EU as the price for avoiding customs checks on the border with the republic.
Cabinet Office Minister Nicholas True said the clauses provide a “safety net” for the government and insisted it is committed to the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the conflict in Northern Ireland, and does not want to see a hard border with Ireland.
“The rule of law is a fundamental element in our constitution, but so is the principle of Parliamentary sovereignty,” True told the House of Lords. “It is permitted for any government in pursuit of the national interest to ask Parliament to legislate to authorize its acting in a manner that would be lawful in domestic law even if unlawful in international law.”

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published images showing a Rigid-Hulled Inflatable Boat maintenance facility at Cambodia's Ream Naval Base still standing on Oct. 1 and the same site without it on Nov. 4.
The news comes after the Pentagon said last month it was concerned about reports that the U.S.-funded Cambodian Navy tactical headquarters facility at Ream just south of the maintenance facility had been demolished.
Last year, the Pentagon asked Cambodia to explain why it turned down an offer to repair the base, saying the decision had raised speculation of possible plans for hosting China's military at a time of growing Sino-U.S. tensions.
Cambodia said last month it had razed the headquarters facility to allow for further expansion and would relocate it, while denying reports of Chinese involvement. It has repeatedly denied reports it has reached a secret deal to let Beijing place forces at the base.
The Cambodian embassy and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the latest report, which illustrates the sort of challenges faced in the region by Democrat Joe Biden, who defeated President Donald Trump in last week's U.S. election.
CSIS said the boat maintenance building was taken down in stages, not just knocked down. 
It said this could support claims that facilities were being relocated, but claims Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's office that buildings were being taken down for renovation were unconvincing given the maintenance facility was only three years old.
Cambodia is one of China's closest allies in Southeast Asia and has received billions of dollars of Chinese aid as well as political backing for Hun Sen in the face of Western criticism.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Major powers, including allies, criticised the United States for its human rights record on Monday during a U.N. review, citing the use of the death penalty, police violence against African Americans and the separation of migrant children from their families.
Activists also said that the Human Rights Council's examination of the United States, the first since May 2015, amounted to an indictment of the Trump administration's policies and called for President-elect Joe Biden to usher in reforms.
Dozens of delegations took the floor at the half-day session to voice concerns and make recommendations.
""What we saw today was unsurprising condemnation by many countries around the world of the United States' human rights record,"" Jamil Dakwar, director of the human rights program at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told a news briefing. 
""We've heard country after country...calling and urging the United States to take serious measures to address structural racism and police violence,"" he said. 
The Trump administration, which quit the Geneva forum in June 2018 accusing it of an anti-Israel bias, defended U.S. policies.
""Our presence in this process demonstrates our nation’s commitment to human rights,"" Robert Destro, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, told the talks. 
The case of George Floyd, an African American who died in May after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignited massive protests across the United States and the world, putting the country's human rights record in the global spotlight once again. 
Alexander Maugeri, U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, said that authorities in Minnesota had filed second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in Floyd's death. 
""A number of member states raised concerns about discrimination and excessive force in policing. Where there is misconduct by police officers or law enforcement agencies, state and federal law provide remedies,"" Maugeri said.
China and Russia called on the United States to root out racism and police violence, while Cuba and Venezuela said it must provide equal access to health care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
France called on U.S. authorities to halt executions at the federal level, close Guantanamo Bay detention facility, and ""guarantee women and girls access to their rights and sexual and reproductive health."" Britain called for ""ensuring access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services.""
Joshua Cooper of the US Human Rights Network, a national network of campaigners, said that more than a dozen countries voiced concern at the U.S. position on family planning.

Austria has acknowledged that ""intolerable mistakes were made"" in the handling of intelligence on the attacker, a convicted jihadist, who killed four people in a shooting rampage in the centre of Vienna last Monday. He was shot dead by police.
First Vienna said it had mishandled information from Slovakia that the gunman had tried to buy ammunition there in July. Then it admitted he had met people from Germany who were under observation there and who travelled to Austria, and that could have led it to see him as a greater threat. 
On Monday it confirmed a report by Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag that he had also met two Islamists arrested in Switzerland in connection with the attack who had travelled to Vienna between July 16 and July 20.
""A meeting took place in Vienna among the people (you) addressed from Germany and Switzerland but there were also people present at the meeting with the later assailant who were arrested in the context of the investigation,"" Director General for Public Security Franz Ruf told a news conference when asked about the reported July meeting.

ANKARA (Reuters) - The abrupt resignation of Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law from one of Turkey's most powerful cabinet positions shocked the government and angered some ruling party members who say the nature of his departure damages the president.
Finance and Treasury Minister Berat Albayrak oversaw economic policy for two tumultuous years during which Turkey endured economic slowdowns, the COVID-19 pandemic and a 45% slide in the lira.
Many people in Turkey, including some officials in Erdogan's AK Party, believed the president was grooming the 42-year-old former businessman as a future party leader and even as possible successor. 
But in a highly unusual resignation statement posted on Instagram on Sunday, Albayrak said he was stepping down, one day after Erdogan sacked the Central Bank governor and, according to officials, ignored Albayrak's preference for a successor.
Albayrak's message, addressed not to Erdogan but ""for the attention of the public"", said he was resigning for health reasons. It was followed by silence as presidency officials said they scrambled, and failed, to track him down for clarification.
It took more than 24 hours for the government to respond, with a brief statement from the presidency saying Erdogan had accepted Albayrak's resignation. There was no immediate decision on a successor.
Earlier, Erdogan made no mention of Albayrak in a speech in Ankara. Television networks, mostly owned by businesses close to the presidency, had studiously ignored the departure of the government's economic policy-maker.
But the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) said Albayrak's resignation via social media was unprecedented and amounted to a ""state crisis"".
Within Erdogan's ruling party, some expressed dismay.
""Resigning like this caused serious damage to both Erdogan and the party,"" an AK Party official said, citing both the content of Albayrak's message and the fact that Erdogan had championed him, at some political cost. 
""Erdogan invested a great deal into Mr Berat. He even upset many ministers and bureaucrats,"" the party official said, pointing to the way Albayrak's role expanded well beyond his remit into areas including national security. 
""In the end, Erdogan was going to bring him to head the party,"" he said. The 66-year-old president, who has ruled Turkey since 2003 and faces his next presidential election in three years time, has not spoken of any plans to step aside.
Modern Turkey's most successful politician, Erdogan has won more than a dozen national and local elections but the weak lira and stuttering economy have eroded his support in recent years. 
TRUTH AND LIES
Three political sources told Reuters that the weekend drama followed economic policy talks at the presidential palace after the latest slump in the lira, which followed a surprise Central Bank decision not to raise its policy interest rate from 10.25% to tackle double digit inflation.
Erdogan, who has long opposed hiking rates to tackle price rises, was also briefed on the extent of Turkey's depleted foreign exchange reserves after authorities used up an estimated $100 billion of reserves this year to curb the lira's slump. 
The officials spoke to Reuters on condition they were not named because they were not authorised to disclose details of the discussions.
They said Erdogan decided that the man he appointed Central Bank governor in July 2019 specifically to bring interest rates down from their then-elevated level of 24% should be replaced.
""That the economy is in shambles and that it was fully caused by the policies of this government became apparent even to the President,"" said Refet Gurkaynak, economics professor at Bilkent University in Ankara.
But Erdogan's choice of former finance minister Naci Agbal to head the bank ran counter to Albayrak's wishes, according to six officials who spoke to Reuters.
""The person that was appointed was not someone Albayrak could work with, not someone who had similar economic views,"" an economic official said.
Albayrak's resignation statement did not spell out any political dispute, but hinted at discord in its description of a ""difficult time like this, where good and bad are mixed, where it is difficult to differentiate between truth and lies"".
His departure could trigger a wider reshuffle of cabinet ministers and presidency staff, a senior Turkish official said.
It will also remain ""politically embarrassing"" for the president, said Wolfango Piccoli of consultancy Teneo.

""Erdogan spent a huge amount of political capital in advancing Berat's path within the party,"" Piccoli said. ""He granted him unparalleled power and influence, and that came at a cost of alienating key figures in the AK Party.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr spoke with Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard last week to try to lower bilateral tension arising from the U.S. arrest of a former Mexican defense minister on drugs charges, two Mexican sources said on Monday.
Mexico says it should have had prior warning about the arrest and investigation of the former minister and retired army officer, Salvador Cienfuegos, who pleaded not guilty to drug charges in a Brooklyn federal court last week.
Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he will announce a review of security cooperation agreements with the United States in light of the case.
Cienfuegos, a top player in Mexico's war on drug gangs until two years ago, is accused of using the power of his office to help a relatively small drug gang, former allies of the Sinaloa Cartel, manufacture and ship drugs including cocaine and heroin to the United States.

The Department of Justice and the New York Eastern District prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The sources did not say whether the call succeeded in reassuring Mexico.

Newspaper El Universal said Lopez Obrador's private secretary Alejandro Esquer had hired shell companies in the 2018 presidential election campaign when Esquer was finance secretary of the ruling National Regeneration Movement party (MORENA).
One of the companies the paper said Esquer had paid for campaign-related services was in September included in a list of firms found by federal tax authorities to lack the means to provide the services advertised in its receipts.
The report was the latest question mark about the probity of people close to Lopez Obrador, who has made fighting corruption the cornerstone of his administration. The president's office did not reply to a request for comment from Esquer.
Responding to questions about the report in a regular news conference, Lopez Obrador said he was unaware of the alleged contracts and that the matter should be ""looked into"".
Calling the report ""part of the campaign to discredit our government"", Lopez Obrador said authorities would make their findings public in due course.
Separately, the head of the finance ministry's financial intelligence unit, Santiago Nieto, told news network Milenio his office had not found anything to incriminate a brother of the president over revelations that surfaced a few months ago.
In August, videos were leaked of the brother, Pio Lopez Obrador, receiving cash in 2015 from a man during a regional election campaign. The man later won a post in the government when Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018.

The president described the cash as contributions to his political movement but ordered federal prosecutors to investigate. They have yet to declare their findings.

Charles Michel's remarks come a day before he will attend a video conference on the ""European response to terrorism"" organised by French President Emmanuel Macron.
Europe has suffered two Islamist militants attacks over the past 10 days, carried out by assailants in the Austrian capital Vienna and the French Riviera city of Nice.
""To fight the ideology of hatred, we need to set up as soon as possible a European institute to train imams in Europe,"" Michel, who heads the European Council comprising the EU's 27 heads of government, said in a Twitter message.
""Online messages glorifying terrorism must be quickly removed. There must be no impunity for terrorists and those praising them on internet,"" he added.

On Friday, EU interior ministers will hold a regular meeting in which they are expected to discuss the recent attacks and new measures to prevent them.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters rallied in the Georgian capital Tbilisi for the second day on Monday, some defying the start of the country's coronavirus curfew, to back opposition calls for a re-run of the Oct. 31 parliamentary election they say was rigged.
There were no immediate reports of disturbances, after more than a dozen protesters were injured on Sunday by volleys of police water cannon outside the Central Election Commission (CEC) headquarters. Protesters were also targeted with tear gas, some witnesses and TV channels reported, but police denied it.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the continent's biggest security and rights watchdog, urged the protesters to refrain from violence and Georgian authorities to respect freedoms of assembly and expression.
The CEC said the ruling Georgian Dream party won 48.23% of the vote on Oct. 31 with the largest opposition party United National Movement (UNM) taking 27.18%.
Eight opposition parties, including the UNM, rejected the official outcome and said they would boycott the parliament.
They accuse the ruling party and its supporters of vote buying, threatening some voters and local election observers and tampering with the vote count. Georgian Dream leaders have denied the accusations.
The opposition is demanding the resignation of CEC chief Tamar Zhvania and the calling of fresh elections.
Monday's protest crowds thinned out after the 10 p.m. (1800 GMT) start of the overnight curfew that is in effect to curb the spread of the coronavirus, but a number of demonstrators remained in the streets, with police standing by.
""We should be very patient as our fight will be difficult,"" Nika Melia, a UNM leader, told protesters, most of them wearing protective masks to ward off coronavirus contagion.

He said that protests would continue in Tbilisi and other cities in the former Soviet republic, with a major rally scheduled for the capital on Saturday.

Josep Borrell said in a blog that it was diplomatic practice to avoid expressions of political preference, but there was no mistaking his delight at the outcome of last week's election.
""It is no secret that the past four years have been complicated in terms of EU-US relations,"" he wrote.
""They were marked by numerous policy disagreements. And we even saw some of the principles that we considered as the bedrock of the transatlantic partnership being eroded, and sometimes even emptied of their substance.""
Borrell welcomed President-elect Biden's stated commitment to restoring unity and respect for democratic norms and institutions, and his assurances that he would work with allies in a spirit of partnership.
""We have a long history of working together based on shared values,"" he said. ""So, we welcome the chance to work once again with a US President who doesn't consider us a 'foe' or believes the EU has been 'set up to take advantage of the U.S.'.""
From his support for Britain's departure from the bloc to a brief downgrade of the EU's status in Washington, Trump's disdain for Brussels and his withdrawal from agreements backed by the EU soured ties between the traditional allies.
Many in Europe hoped the election would bring a new president and, with it, a shift in U.S. policy on issues from climate to trade, NATO and the Iran nuclear deal.
Borrell said Europe should support Washington's ""return to the table"" on the Paris climate agreement, Iran and the World Health Organization, and a constructive stance on bilateral trade and the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement system.
He said Europe hoped the Biden administration would be ""solid in its commitment"" to the NATO defence alliance but acknowledged that Europe needed to ""up its game"" and take more responsibility for its own security.
Borrell said the EU would reach out to the Biden team in the coming weeks, but needed to be aware that its priorities would be to handle the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences and to heal America's ""enormous divisions"".

He said Biden's room for manoeuvre in foreign policy may also be limited by a Republican-controlled Senate.

BEIJING/MOSCOW (Reuters) - China and Russia held off congratulating U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on Monday, with Beijing saying it would follow usual custom in its response and the Kremlin noting incumbent Donald Trump's vow to pursue legal challenges.
Democrat Biden clinched enough states to win the presidency on Saturday and has begun making plans for when he takes office on Jan. 20. Trump has not conceded defeat and plans rallies to build support for legal challenges.
Some of the United States' biggest and closest allies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia quickly congratulated Biden over the weekend despite Trump's refusal to concede, as did some Trump allies, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday called for the European Union and United States to work ""side by side"", holding up Biden as an experienced leader who knows Germany and Europe well and stressing the NATO allies' shared values and interests.
Beijing and Moscow were cautious.
""We noticed that Mr. Biden has declared election victory,"" China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily media briefing. ""We understand that the U.S. presidential election result will be determined following U.S. law and procedures.""
In 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent congratulations to Trump on Nov. 9, a day after the election.
Relations between China and the United States are at their worst in decades over disputes ranging from technology and trade to Hong Kong and the coronavirus, and the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of sanctions against Beijing.
While Biden is expected to maintain a tough stance on China -- he has called Xi a ""thug"" and vowed to lead a campaign to ""pressure, isolate and punish China"" -- he is likely to take a more measured and multilateral approach.
Chinese state media struck an optimistic tone in editorials, saying relations could be restored to a state of greater predictability, starting with trade.
KREMLIN NOTES TRUMP'S LAW SUITS
The Kremlin said it would wait for the official results of the election before commenting, and that it had noted Trump's announcement of legal challenges.
President Vladimir Putin has remained silent since Biden's victory. In the run-up to the vote, Putin had appeared to hedge his bets, frowning on Biden's anti-Russian rhetoric but welcoming his comments on nuclear arms control. Putin had also defended Biden's son, Hunter, against criticism from Trump.
""We think it appropriate to wait for the official vote count,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
Biden cleared the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House on Saturday, four days after the Nov. 3 election. He beat Trump by more than 4 million votes nationwide, making Trump the first president since 1992 to lose re-election.
Asked why, in 2016, Putin had congratulated Trump soon after he had won the Electoral College and beaten Democrat Hillary Clinton, Peskov said there was an obvious difference.
""You can see that there are certain legal procedures that have been announced by the current president. That is why the situations are different and we therefore think it appropriate to wait for an official announcement,"" he said.
Peskov noted that Putin had repeatedly said he was ready to work with any U.S. leader and that Russia hoped it could establish dialogue with a new U.S. administration and find a way to normalise troubled bilateral relations.
Moscow's ties with Washington sank to post-Cold War lows in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Biden was serving as vice president under President Barack Obama at the time.
Relations soured further over U.S. allegations that Moscow had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to try to tilt the vote in Trump's favour, something the Kremlin denied.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The U.S. envoy to Lebanon said on Monday that Lebanese Christian politician Gebran Bassil, who has been sanctioned by the United States, had voiced willingness to sever ties with Hezbollah, challenging his assertion that he rejected the idea outright.
Washington on Friday blacklisted Bassil, son-in-law of Lebanon's president and leader of its biggest Christian bloc, over charges of corruption and ties with the Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah, which Washington deems a terrorist group.
Bassil slammed the sanctions as unjust and politically motivated, saying they were imposed after he refused to submit to a U.S. demand to break ties with Hezbollah as that would risk Lebanon's national unity and peace.
U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea said in a video aired by local broadcasters that Bassil, in exchanges with her, had ""expressed willingness to break with Hezbollah, on certain conditions.
""He actually expressed gratitude that the United States had gotten him to see how the relationship is disadvantageous to the party,"" said Shea, without elaborating on the conditions.
Bassil's office issued a statement saying Shea's comments aimed to ""drive a wedge"" between his Free Patriotic Movement party and Hezbollah, but that the attempt would not work. 
He, along with an array of the political elite, have been the target of protests since October 2019 against widely perceived corruption, waste and mismanagement of state funds.
Bassil denied corruption charges and said he would fight the sanctions in U.S. courts and sue for damages. President Michel Aoun said Lebanon would seek evidence from Washington. 
""We endeavour to make as much information publicly available as possible when announcing designations, but, as is often the case, some of this information is not releasable,"" said Shea, adding Bassil was welcome to legally contest the blacklisting.
Bassil was sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets human rights abuses and corruption. Shea did not rule out further sanctions against him or others in Lebanon.

Washington in September blacklisted two former Lebanese government ministers it accused of directing political and economic favours to Hezbollah.

""I hope we can work to restart sincere and direct channels of decent dialogue between the future government of Joe Biden and the government over which I preside,"" Maduro said in a state television address on Sunday, a day after the former U.S. Vice President defeated Trump's re-election bid. 
Trump, a Republican, has used economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to pressure the socialist Venezuelan leader to resign, accusing him of corruption, human rights violations, and rigging his 2018 re-election win. 
Washington closed its Caracas embassy last year and cut off ties with Maduro after recognizing Juan Guaido, the speaker of the opposition-held National Assembly, as Venezuela's rightful leader. Dozens of other countries have also recognized Guaido, and the United States has also imposed sanctions on the OPEC nation's oil industry. 
Biden advisers have said he would push for humanitarian relief in Venezuela and modify the sanctions framework, without dismantling it entirely. The sanctions have proven popular among opposition supporters in Venezuela, as well as many voters of Venezuelan and Cuban descent in Florida, a battleground state that is closely fought between Democrats and Republicans.
Both Maduro and Guaido congratulated Biden on his victory on Saturday.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Polish president ratifies defence deal with U.S.,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish President Andrzej Duda ratified a defence agreement with the United States on Monday that cements a greater U.S. troop presence in the country and he said Warsaw's relations with Washington should not be affected by the U.S. election.
The deal was agreed between Duda and U.S. President Donald Trump over a year ago and aims to bolster the Western military presence on NATO's eastern flank in reaction to an increased assertiveness by Russia.
Joe Biden's election as the next U.S. president puts Warsaw in a potentially awkward position after it had set great store in its relationship with Trump while straining links with EU allies over democratic values.
During the election campaign, Biden had accused Trump of backing authoritarian leaders around the world, mentioning Poland among others. 
He is expected to review Trump's decision to withdraw thousands of troops from Germany, although U.S. officials have insisted the agreement with Poland was separate from that move.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said he hoped some of the troops will be moved to Poland.
Duda said he believed Warsaw's relations with Washington were ""entirely unrelated to current political events"" in a reference to the U.S. election.
""In carrying out our tasks in the field of Polish politics and Polish-American relations, we act calmly, also by ratifying this agreement, waiting for the newly elected president of the United States to take his oath,"" Duda said.
Under the agreement, a 1,000 U.S. troops would be stationed in Poland on top of several thousand already there as part of a NATO deployment.
Poland's nationalist government allied with Duda shared a host of views with Trump on issues ranging from abortion, migration to climate change and coal mining.
The head of the National Security Bureau said in a statement the timing of Monday's ratification by Duda was not related to the U.S. election.
""This is a normal ratification process. The President could only ratify the agreement after the parliament agreed to it and once the new legislation came into force,"" Pawel Soloch said.

BRASILIA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The presidents of Latin America's two largest countries are holding back, even as other leaders around the globe have been lining up to congratulate Joe Biden on winning the U.S. presidential election.
Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro had boasted he would be the first leader in the world to congratulate his idol Donald Trump on his re-election, but now that Biden has won, not a peep has been heard from the usually very talkative populist leader.
In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday reiterated he would not recognize the election winner until pending legal disputes are resolved, but said he had ""no problem"" with Biden, who many world leaders have already congratulated.
Biden declared victory on Saturday, four days after the Nov. 3 election. 
Trump has launched an array of lawsuits to press claims of election fraud for which he has produced no evidence. State officials say they are not aware of any significant irregularities.
López Obrador and Bolsonaro are part of a shrinking group of world leaders to not congratulate Biden, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping. 
Bolsonaro's silence could point to a bad start for a relationship with Biden who is expected to put Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) deforestation and human rights at the top of his agenda with Brazil.
""I think the president is waiting for this imbroglio over fraudulent votes to be resolved: if there is nothing, he will give his view,"" Brazil's Vice President Hamilton Mourão told reporters on Monday.
Bolsonaro will congratulate Biden ""at the right time"" and will wait to see what happens with the lawsuits Trump plans, Mourão said.
Meanwhile, Lopez Obrador said on Monday he was bound by the constitution from offering his congratulations to the winner until the legal disputes were straightened out, repeating a posture he adopted on the election on Saturday.
""How can a president of Mexico become a judge and say: 'This candidate won'?"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference.
He briefly referred to Biden as the ""possible president-elect,"" before stressing Mexico took no side. ""We have no differences with the Democratic Party candidate, Mr. Biden,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""No problem with him.""
Whereas Bolsonaro may have acted out of continued support for Trump, Lopez Obrador seems keen to avoid friction with the U.S. president who has often used Mexico as a veritable political piñata.
Trump took office in 2017 pledging to build a wall on the U.S. southern border to keep out migrants, and last year threatened to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods if Lopez Obrador did not cut illegal immigration into the United States.
In stark contrast, Brazil's relationship with the United States improved under Trump, with Bolsonaro aligning Latin America's largest nation closely with the United States since taking office, in a shift toward conservative nationalism.
He has followed Trump in distancing Brazil from multilateral agencies such as the World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization, from which he differed in opposing social distancing and lockdowns to fight COVID-19, even as Brazil suffered the most fatal outbreak outside the United States.
For Thiago de Aragão, a senior associate at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, the close economic ties between Brazil and the United States mean the bilateral relationship will be resilient despite the delayed congratulation.

""The environmental issue could create friction, but there is no bad relationship that cannot be resolved with a phone call,"" he said.

Washington, which has announced under outgoing President Donald Trump that it is quitting the WHO in part because of what it describes as pro-China bias, has pressed for the organiztion to allow Taiwan to attend meetings as an observer. Beijing, which says the island is part of China, rejects this.
The WHO's decision-making annual assembly of 194 states is taking place via video conference this week after being adjourned in May amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Assembly President Keva Bain said a committee had recommended not to approve a proposal to include Taiwan as an observer, which had been backed by around 14 states.
China's ambassador Chen Xu said the proposal to include Taiwan ""violates the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and rejects the 'One China' principle"".
Taiwan's foreign ministry late on Sunday blamed ""obstruction"" from China blocking its attendance. Taiwan held observer status at the WHO between 2009-2016. It has complained that its exclusion makes it more difficult to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
""The Foreign Ministry expresses strong regret and dissatisfaction at China's obstruction of Taiwan participating in the WHO and the WHO's continuing to neglect the health and human rights of Taiwan's 23.5 million people,"" it said.
Taiwan is locked out of most global organisations due to the objections of China, which considers the island one of its provinces with no right to the trappings of a sovereign state.

The WHO says it cooperates with Taiwan on health matters including on aspects of the pandemic, and that the island has been provided with the help it needs, but that it is up to member states to decide whether to invite it to the meeting.

LONDON (Reuters) - The head of Britain's BBC said on Monday the corporation would hold an inquiry into how the broadcaster secured a famous 1995 interview with the late Princess Diana, amid accusations from her brother she had been tricked into taking part.
During the interview, which was watched by more than 20 million viewers in Britain, Diana shocked the nation by admitting to an affair and giving details of her failed marriage to heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles.
""The BBC is taking this very seriously and we want to get to the truth,"" Tim Davie, the BBC's director general said in a statement about Spencer's claims. ""We are in the process of commissioning a robust and independent investigation.""
This month, her brother Charles Spencer said the BBC had failed to apologise for what he said were forged documents and ""other deceit"" which led him to introduce journalist Martin Bashir to Diana.
The Daily Mail has also published what it said were notes Spencer took during a meeting with Bashir and Diana in 1995, in which the newspaper says the journalist made a series of allegations in an attempt to obtain the interview.
These included claims Diana was being bugged by the security services, that two senior aides were being paid to provide information about her, and that Bashir had provided faked bank statements to back this up.
Bashir has not commented on the matter. Reuters has been unable to contact him.
The BBC says the journalist, who gained global renown from the Diana interview and is currently the corporation's religious affairs correspondent, was currently on sick leave, recovering from heart surgery and from contracting COVID-19. 
UNHAPPY MARRIAGE
Spencer has demanded an apology from the BBC and an independent inquiry into how Bashir obtained the interview with Diana, saying he had been excluded from a 1996 internal BBC investigation. The BBC says it has apologised for the faked statements.
In his Twitter posts on Sunday, Spencer said he knew Bashir had used fake bank statements and other dishonesty to obtain the Diana interview but said ""what I only found out 2 weeks ago ... is that the BBC also knew. Not only knew about it, but that they covered it up.""
His assertion came after the release of documents from the BBC following requests under the Freedom of Information Act from a journalist who had been researching the interview. 
The Panorama interview was Diana's first public comments about her doomed union with Charles, although author Andrew Morton said she secretly cooperated with his 1992 book which first revealed how she was trapped in an unhappy marriage.
Her comment to Bashir that ""there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded"" - a reference to Charles rekindling his relationship with his now second wife Camilla - was particularly damaging to her husband.
The couple divorced in 1996 and she was killed aged 36 in a car crash in Paris the following year.
Former BBC chairman Michael Grade said the issue was ""a very, very serious matter"" for the publicly-funded broadcaster. 

""For the BBC to be faking documents in the interests of getting a scoop raises very serious questions,"" he told BBC radio. ""The BBC needs to clean this up once and for all.""

CHICUZ, Guatemala (Reuters) - Matilde Ical Chen was toasting tortillas over a wood fire for the midday meal when the landslide ripped through the Guatemalan Mayan indigenous village of Queja, burying her mother, sisters and grandparents in a torrent of liquid earth and rock.
Ical Chen, 49, grabbed her husband and six small children and ran, barely surviving a fall into a ravine, she told Reuters in Chicuz, a hamlet three hours on foot from Queja, where she and hundreds of other survivors are now sheltered in a primary school after Thursday's disaster.
""My mother was buried, along with my sisters, their husbands, the whole family, even the grandparents,"" Ical Chen said though an interpreter, counting approximately 30 family members who did not escape the mud that rescuers say is up to 50 feet (15 meters) deep. 
""We have food here, but I can't eat for the worry,"" she said, clutching a scarf as tears ran down her cheeks. 
A deluge linked to storm Eta killed dozens and caused devastation from Panama to Mexico last week. But perhaps nowhere was harder hit than Guatemala, where poor Mayan villages precariously perched on lush mountainsides are susceptible to landslides. 
Rescuers say they may never know how many people were buried in the mud in Queja, about 200 km (125 miles) from Guatemala City. The government has estimated up to 150 lives lost.
But braving loose ground and new landslides that made rescue work perilous, survivors returned on Sunday desperately looking for relatives and scant belongings - clothes, a little food, their livestock. 
With the first break from days of relentless rain allowing more access, helicopters buzzed in and out of the village and surrounding hamlets, bringing supplies and rescue workers who recovered at least six bodies, even as new landslides endangered more lives. 
At least two people were killed when a light aircraft carrying humanitarian aid for the disaster area crashed in Guatemala City, while another helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing. 
Rolando Cal was among the survivors who made the treacherous trek back to Queja, a Poqomchi' Mayan settlement of about 1,300 people, searching for any of his 23 relatives lost in the mud when the mountainside collapsed after days of rain. 
""This is where my whole family and my home were destroyed,"" Cal said, pointing to a pile of rubble where his house once stood, a vast gash of bare earth stark against the lush landscape and remaining houses beyond. 
""I no longer have a place to live,"" said Cal, who walked into Queja on Sunday from neighboring Santa Elena, where he has found shelter. ""Without food, without money. I'm miserable.""
When a helicopter carrying supplies organized by a retired general, Francisco Mus, arrived in Chicuz, survivors huddled in the schoolyard ran out, desperate for possible news of loved ones left behind. Among some 450 people sheltered at the school, many were saved by Chicuz residents who risked their own lives to clamber into gullies and pull stranded families up with ropes, village official Raul Gualin said. 
Bedraggled, and with only the clothes on her back, Ical Chen said she was grateful to the village for taking her in. She too thinks she, her husband and children will not return to Queja now, or maybe ever. 

""We will try to find refuge in another place, and not go back there,"" she said. ""I lost my whole family.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Beijing restaurant owner congratulated her ""old friend"" and one-time customer Joe Biden on Monday after the U.S. Democratic candidate emerged victorious in a tightly fought U.S. presidential election, and invited him back to try some pork liver. 
The publicity following Biden's visit nine years ago boosted business for quite a while, with many customers coming in and asking for the ""Biden set,"" said owner Yao Yan, 66. 
Biden had dined on noodles and steamed buns for lunch in August 2011 at the Yaoji Chaogan restaurant in the Chinese capital's Drum Tower district, during an official visit to Beijing as U.S. vice president. 
His victory in the 2020 election has given her restaurant another lift, with one of Monday's patrons, 58-year-old lawyer Shi Longmin, admitting he decided to ""tick this place off the list"" after learning of Biden's previous visit. 
Yao, meanwhile, hoped Biden could promote ""friendly"" relations between the United States and China - currently at their lowest point in decades - during his time in office.
But she also wanted the U.S. president-elect to return to her restaurant to sample some of the food he had missed out on first time around, such as its signature dish - stewed pork liver. 

""There are lots of delicious flavours awaiting his arrival,"" Yao said.

VILLAZON, Bolivia (Reuters) - Former longtime Bolivian leader Evo Morales crossed the border back into Bolivia on Monday, ending a year in exile, after a close ally and member of his MAS socialist party was sworn in as president. 
Morales, who led Bolivia for almost 14 years as the first indigenous president, entered the country from Argentina after a farewell ceremony presided over by Argentine President Alberto Fernandez. 
Morales, who left Bolivia under a cloud in November 2019 after international observers cited irregularities in an election that gave him a fourth term in office, said that being able to return filled him ""with happiness."" 
""Today is one of the most important days of my life, to be returning to the country that I love so much fills me with happiness,"" he wrote on Twitter.
New President Luis Arce has said that Morales will play no role in his government. 
Morales crossed the border from Argentina, where he has been living in exile, at 9 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) and is expected to head to his rural stronghold in Chapare.
Around 2,000 supporters, including members of Argentine social and political groups, gathered at the La Quiaca crossing on Monday morning to see him off. They waved the flag of the Argentine indigenous people, and played music on traditional instruments, according to Reuters reporters.
Fernandez told the crowd that the electoral turmoil in Bolivia reminded all Latin Americans about the need for regional solidarity. ""We are part of a large nation,"" he said. ""We don't want countries for some, we want countries for all. It is the duty of all of us to stand up for threatened peoples."" 
On the Bolivian side of the frontier, in Villazón, a far bigger crowd was waiting to welcome its exiled former leader. 
Morales took part in an indigenous blessing ceremony before heading to address the large crowds gathered in Villazon. 
After 11 months of caretaker government, Arce, 57, won elections in October by a landslide and was sworn in as president on Sunday in a ceremony in the highland city of La Paz in front of heads of state from Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia and Spain, as well as senior officials from Chile, Iran and the government of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.

The reserved former economy minister, feted as the architect of Bolivia's rapid growth under Morales, vowed to ""defeat"" the coronavirus pandemic, ""put an end to fear"" after deadly electoral violence last year, and generate growth following the blow dealt by COVID-19 lockdowns.

1069,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Slovakia says COVID double-testing cut number of infections by more than half,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Slovakia's coronavirus testing and quarantine scheme, running over the past two weekends, has helped cut the proportion of infections by more than half, Prime Minister Igor Matovic said on Monday.
The country of 5.5 million tested 3.6 million people, excluding small children and some senior citizens, over the first weekend in November, with those testing positive having to go into quarantine.
It repeated tests for just over 2 million over this past weekend when testing took place only in more affected areas, with the infection rate turning out to be much lower thanks to the earlier quarantine orders. 
The scheme has been watched by other countries struggling with a spike in coronavirus cases.
Taking into account districts that were tested on both weekends, the infection rate dropped from 1.47% on the first weekend to 0.62% of those who took the test on the second weekend, Matovic told a news conference. 
Including some additional tests done among police services, senior homes and companies, the second round returned 13,509 positive results.
""We are going into a tough winter,"" Matovic said. ""We have an extraordinarily effective tool in antigen testing that cuts the share of infected people by 58%.""
The testing was free and voluntary, but the government imposed a lockdown, including a ban on work commutes, on those who refused to take the test.
People have to carry around certificates saying they took the test and tested negative. 
The scheme used antigen swab tests that return results within 15-30 minutes but are less accurate than standard laboratory PCR tests.The government has argued that while it was aware the tests may miss a sizeable proportion of those infected, it was still worth it and repeated testing narrowed that probability of falsely negative results.
Slovakia has not been among hardest-hit European countries, but it saw an acceleration of cases in October and hoped the testing would help it avoid a surge seen in the neighbouring Czech Republic, which has suffered Europe's worst infection and death rates in the past weeks. 

Slovakia has recorded 76,072 cases through standard PCR testing so far and 366 deaths. The antigen testing, including a pilot scheme and the two large-scale rounds, identified 57,462 cases.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees announced on Monday that it has run out of money to pay the salaries of its staff across the Middle East, after two years of funding cuts by the United States and some other donors.
The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said it needs $70 million by the end of the month to pay 28,000 staff in full for November and December.
It also issued an emergency call for donations to avoid the suspension of essential services.
""Despite all of our efforts to raise the resources needed to keep our humanitarian and development programmes running, it was with great regret that I informed our staff today that we don't have sufficient funding at this stage to honor their salaries this month,"" UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement.
""If additional funding is not pledged in the next weeks, UNRWA will be forced to defer partial salaries to all staff.""
The agency was badly hit by President Donald Trump's 2018 decision to cut all U.S. funding to UNRWA, which amounted to more than $300 million a year.
The United States was by far the biggest donor to UNRWA, which provides education, health and relief services to around 5.7 million registered refugees. 
But there have also been cuts from other donors, including in the Gulf, where some states recently signed U.S.-brokered normalisation deals with Israel.
President-elect Joe Biden is expected to resume funding to UNRWA, at least partially. 
But that is likely to take months, say UNRWA officials, too late to meet the hole in the agency's $1.4 billion annual budget, including emergency programs for Gaza, Syria and COVID.
""Now that Biden is elected we are very much looking forward to the U.S. resuming its traditional support for UNRWA and consequently encourage the Gulf countries to also step in or step up their funding,"" said Tamara al-Rifai, an UNRWA spokeswoman.
Amir El-Mishal, chairman of UNRWA's Palestinian employees' union in Gaza, said Lazzarini had informed staff from all the areas where the agency is active, including the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
""It fell upon us like a thunderbolt,"" said Mishal. ""Any impact on the salaries of employees will bring about negative consequences on the services provided to Palestinian refugees amid the continued threat to their jobs."" said Mishal.
Mishal said UNRWA has 13,000 employees in Gaza, a place that has already been devastated by economic hardships and armed conflicts.
The agency has also faced other problems. In 2019 former Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl resigned amid an investigation into misconduct allegations. 
He denied wrongdoing and said his agency was the victim of a political campaign designed to undermine it. UNRWA officials said a U.N. inquiry found there had been no corruption or misuse of funds. 

Last year the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly renewed UNRWA's mandate for another three years, with 169 votes in favour and nine abstentions. The United States and Israel voted against.

Muyesser Yildiz, the Ankara news editor for the OdaTV online news portal, was formally arrested in June. She was initially detained on espionage charges but this was later changed to revealing state secrets.
One article published in December questioned which Turkish commanders met Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the Libyan National Army, which is fighting the internationally recognised Government of National Accord of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, backed by Turkey.
The second article, from January, gave details about a military officer who was sent to Libya to oversee Turkey's involvement there.
The court ordered Yildiz's release on Monday after ruling she may not have committed the crime she was charged with, state-owned news agency Anadolu said. The court ruled to keep an army sergeant held in the same case in custody, it added.
Ismail Dukel, Ankara representative of broadcaster TELE1, was also detained along with Yildiz in June. He was released after his questioning.
OdaTV, an online news outlet, has been critical of President Tayyip Erdogan's government. Turkey ranks among the world's top jailers of journalists.
Critics say Erdogan has used a failed 2016 military coup as a pretext to clamp down on dissent and strengthen his grip on power, a charge Ankara denies. It says the measures are necessary to safeguard national security.

The Internal Market Bill is designed to protect trade between Britain four nations after Brexit. It contains clauses ministers say are needed to protect Northern Ireland, but would also break international law in a ""specific and limited"" way.
The House of Lords will vote around 1900 GMT on whether to strip those clauses from the bill. Johnson's government is widely expected to lose, but is not backing down and may add the clauses back in next month and try to force them into law. 
The publication of the bill in September provoked criticism with some saying it would wreck Britain's international standing. Biden tweeted on Sept. 16 that anything which risked peace in Northern Ireland would threaten Anglo-American trade.
Many saw the bill as a negotiating gambit to win concessions from the EU in wider negotiations on a trade deal. Brussels has launched legal action against Britain over the proposals.
Johnson says the clauses are there to act as a safety net in case ongoing negotiations with the EU fail to work out how goods can flow between Britain, the British province of Northern Ireland, and across the unmanned border with EU member Ireland. 
Monday's vote leaves Johnson with a decision: accept the defeat and let the rest of the bill become law, or fight it by adding the clauses back in when the bill returns to the lower house of parliament next month.
""Our position remains that the clauses are a vital safety net,"" Johnson's spokesman told reporters.

However, the clauses may no longer be needed if talks with the EU on how to make the Irish border work are successful.

LONDON (Reuters) - A 5.0 billion pound ($6.6 billion) English lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP has been blocked, in a blow to a 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group, seeking damages after a devastating dam failure in 2015.
A High Court judge in Manchester, northwestern England, struck out the largest group claim in English legal history because the complex case was an ""abuse of the process of the court"", a judgment published on Monday said.
Tom Goodhead, a partner at law firm PGMBM, which is representing the claimants, called the judgment ""fundamentally flawed"" and pledged to appeal.
BHP, the world's largest miner by market value, clashed with claimants during an eight-day jurisdiction hearing in July in the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.
The judge's decision comes about 18 months after the United Kingdom's Supreme Court ruled that nearly 2,000 Zambian villagers could sue miner Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) in England for alleged pollution in Africa because substantial justice was not obtainable in Zambia. 
The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a torrent of red mud into communities and the Doce river that reached the Altantic Ocean, 650kms away. 

Despite a more deadly dam rupture in 2019, that killed about 270 in nearby Brumadinho, the Fundao dam disaster in Brazil's ""iron quadrangle"" in southeastern Minas Gerais state ranks as the country's worst environmental disaster.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania's new ruling coalition agreed on Monday to commit their incoming government to support ""those fighting for freedom"" in Taiwan, threatening to hurt the small EU member's relations with China, a potential investor in its main port.
European Union member states, and the bloc itself, have no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan due to the objections of Beijing, which considers the island part of China.
The Lithuanian coalition agreement, signed by leaders of the Homeland Union, Liberal Movement and Freedom parties, which together won 74 seats in 141-seat parliament on Oct. 25, binds the new government to carry out a ""values-based foreign policy"".
""We will actively oppose any violation of human rights and democratic freedoms, and will defend those fighting for freedom around the world, from Belarus to Taiwan,"" they said.
The Vilnius embassy of China did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Likely next Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte told a news conference the new government would ""not only note what happens near our borders, but also globally"". 
The outgoing Lithuanian government did not dispute Beijing's ""one China"" policy towards Taiwan. Still, China protested in May as Lithuania said Taiwan should be allowed observers at World Health Organization during the pandemic.
Lithuania's relationship with China took a hit in 2013 as former President Dalia Grybauskaite met in Vilnius with the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. China brands him a dangerous separatist.

Relations have recovered since then, though Lithuania last year lodged a protest after Chinese diplomats were involved in disruptions during a pro-Hong Kong protest in Vilnius.

Albayrak's resignation, citing health reasons, came a day after President Tayyip Erdogan, his father in-law, appointed former finance minister Naci Agbal to replace former bank chief Murat Uysal. No reason was given for the move, but officials said the lira's slump was to blame.
Speaking at a news conference in Ankara, the leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP), Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said that Erdogan was running the country like a ""family company"", adding that the central bank had lost its independence. He also said it was shameful that no major Turkish media outlet had reported the resignation in nearly 24 hours.

Debold Sinas's appointment also caused a stir on social media, where users recalled how as Manila police chief he had celebrated his birthday in May with dozens of senior officers at a party that defied strict coronavirus lockdown rules. 
Sinas is the latest commander to rise to the top post under Duterte having led operations in bloody hotspots of his war on drugs, during which thousands of urban poor have been killed, many in mysterious circumstances.
Rights groups accuse police of executing suspected dealers. Police say those killed in their operations were legitimate targets who resisted arrest. 
""What lies ahead for the Filipino people with Sinas's appointment is a bloody party of human rights violations,"" said Cristina Palabay of rights group, Karapatan.
""This fascist regime is gearing up for an intensified crackdown on dissent and assault on human rights."" 
Sinas could not be reached and the national police did not respond to a request for comment.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte valued his track record and ""big"" contribution to drug war.
Asked about his suitability, Roque said Duterte need not explain his appointments.
A United Nations report in June said tens of thousands of people may have been killed in the drug war amid ""near impunity"" for police and incitement to violence by top officials. The government rejected that as baseless. 
Sinas apologised after photographs online showed him with dozens of police at his party in May, flouting a ban on gatherings.
Carlos Conde, Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch, said drugs killings were rampant in the central region under Sinas and his appointment did not bode well for human rights.
""He seems very loyal to Duterte and it looks like he's going to do what Duterte would ask him to do,"" he said.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",China holds off on sending congratulations to Biden,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China, which has held off on congratulating U.S. presidential election winner Joe Biden even as leaders of other countries have done so, said on Monday it would follow custom in responding to the result.
Democrat Biden clinched enough states to win the presidency but incumbent President Donald Trump has not conceded and is making legal challenges to the outcome of the Nov. 3 election.
""We noticed that Mr. Biden has declared election victory,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily media briefing. ""We understand that the U.S. presidential election result will be determined following U.S. law and procedures.""
In 2016, Xi sent congratulations to Trump on Nov. 9, a day after the election. 
Relations between China and the United States are at their worst in decades over disputes ranging from technology and trade to Hong Kong and the coronavirus, and the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of sanctions against Beijing.
While Biden is expected to maintain a tough stance on China -- he has called President Xi Jinping a ""thug"" and vowed to lead a campaign to ""pressure, isolate and punish China"" -- he is likely to take a more measured and multilateral approach.
""We always believe that China and the United States should enhance communication and dialogue, manage differences on the basis of mutual respect, expand cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and promote sound and stable development of bilateral relations,"" Wang told the briefing. 
Hu Xijin, editor of the Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said in a tweet: ""China hasn't congratulated Biden on his victory as quickly as Western countries did.""
""I think it's because China needs to keep larger distance from the US presidential election to avoid getting entangled in its controversy. This actually shows that China respects the US as a whole,"" he added.
Earlier on Monday, Chinese state media struck an optimistic tone in editorials, saying relations could be restored to a state of greater predictability, starting with trade.
While acknowledging that Washington was unlikely to ease pressure on China over issues such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong, the Global Times said Beijing should work to communicate with Biden's team.
""It's in the common interests of people from both countries and of the international community that China-U.S. relations become eased and controllable,"" it said. 
The China Daily said it was ""obvious"" improving ties with China could start from trade, and reviving trade talks was critical to restoring some understanding and trust. 
Wang Huiyao, head of the Center for China and Globalization and an advisor to the government in Beijing, said he expects more dialogue under a Biden administration.
""Biden's election means an opportunity to re-establish relations with the U.S. as he is more likely to uphold multilateralism. That means China and the U.S. can start discussing issues including climate change, pandemic control and trade,"" Wang told Reuters.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 07:37AM ET</span>",Hong Kong pro-democracy legislators threaten mass resignations,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong pro-democracy legislators threatened mass resignations on Monday amid reports Beijing plans to disqualify four opposition lawmakers who had been accused by the ruling camp of potentially unlawful filibustering in the legislature.
Earlier on Monday, local news site HK01 reported, citing unnamed sources, that Beijing might make the move later this week in the latest squeeze on opposition politicians in the former British colony. 
The four have been accused by pro-Beijing politicians of filibustering to obstruct legislation, which has long been a tactic in Hong Kong. Some pro-Beijing lawmakers say it may be contrary to the oath of office.
The report did not detail a specific incident or incidents of alleged attempts to obstruct legislation, nor say what legal mechanism Beijing would use to disqualify them. The Hong Kong government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""We would like to use the mass resignation on one hand to reflect our unity and on other hand to reflect the tyranny of the central government and the HKSAR,"" said Wu Chi-wai, chairman of the Democratic Party.
The pro-democracy camp currently has 19 seats in the 70-seat legislature.
The speculation comes a week after eight prominent opposition politicians were arrested in connection with a meeting in the Legislative Council in May that descended into chaos. 
The four identified by HK01 as the names being considered for disqualification - Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung - were not among those eight.
The four had been among 12 candidates disqualified from running for an election for the city's legislature, initially scheduled for September, but postponed for a year with authorities citing coronavirus risks. The terms of all lawmakers were extended by a year.
Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved swiftly to crack down on dissent in the global financial hub after anti-government protests that flared in June last year plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades.
Critics of the Beijing-backed Hong Kong government have accused it of stifling freedoms in the city and slammed the postponement of election in September in which the pro-democracy opposition hoped to make significant gains.

The election would have been the first since Beijing imposed a contentious national security law on its freest city on June 30 that authorities said was necessary to bring stability after anti-government protests plunged the city into turmoil.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>","Explainer: Suu Kyi, the army, insurgency - Myanmar's 2020 election explained","YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar’s ruling party led by Aung San Suu Kyi claimed victory on Monday after a general election seen as a referendum on the first democratic government to lead the country since the end of decades of military rule.
The spokesman for her National League for Democracy Party (NLD) said its unofficial count showed it had won the 322 seats needed to form a new government, though results from the election commission had not been released.
While the reputation of the Nobel laureate has collapsed internationally over disputed allegations of genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority, she remains beloved at home and massive crowds queued from dawn on Sunday to vote despite fears the coronavirus would dampen the turnout.
Many spoke of the importance of retaining the NLD’s grip on power to counterbalance the influence of the military in politics after half a century of direct rule ended within reforms in 2011, though critics say the party has achieved little to progress the democratic transition.
Despite the emergence of new parties, many still saw the vote as a straight choice between the NLD and the military-backed opposition, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which performed poorly. Nevertheless, the army will remain a dominant force.
Here’s what the election means for Myanmar's complex political landscape.
THE LADY AND THE GENERALS
Suu Kyi, 75, still known as “Mother Suu”, leads the country as state counselor, a position she will likely retain. She has not indicated a successor.
Critics say she runs her cabinet with an authoritarian streak and has not gone far enough to challenge army abuses.
Despite old tensions over issues including constitutional reform, the ruling party aligned itself with the military on key issues during its first term, including conflict in ethnic areas and the Rohingya crisis.
The ruling party spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters the NLD would continue to work “hand in hand” with the army.
Myanmar’s constitution guarantees the army a quarter of seats in parliament and control of key ministries including Home Affairs. It also grants the military an effective veto on any challenges.
ETHNIC GRIEVANCES
While more than 90 political parties competed in the polls, smaller parties including the People's Pioneer Party, set up by a disillusioned former ally of Suu Kyi, made little impression and said they were hampered by coronavirus restrictions.
The NLD ""becoming a giant party with no good oppositions is what worries me the most"", said activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi on Twitter.
Ethnic-based parties did draw votes away in states including Kayah, Mon and Shan states, according to early results reported by media and candidates.
Many people from ethnic minorities feel sidelined by the central government, which is dominated by the Bamar Buddhist majority and has pursued alienating policies including a statue-building campaign depicting Suu Kyi's father, Aung San.
The first-past-the-post system and internal migration mean ethnic parties receive fewer seats than they would otherwise, risking disillusionment with the democratic process, analysts say.
A key question will be whether the NLD will reach out to ethnic parties for government posts regardless, historian Thant Myint-U said on Twitter.
ROHINGYA AND RAKHINE
One of the country’s gravest challenges is in the western state of Rakhine, where 730,000 ethnic Rohingya Muslims fled in 2017 following a military crackdown the United Nations said was executed with genocidal intent. 
Myanmar is facing charges of genocide at the Hague, which it denies, saying the campaign was legitimately targeting insurgents who attacked police posts.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya are confined to camps and villages where the vast majority are denied citizenship and freedom of movement.
Few were able to vote on Sunday and their plight was not on the agenda of any major party.
The Democracy and Human Rights Party, a Rohingya political party, said the vote illustrated the “normalization” of their exclusion and an “apartheid” system.
Rakhine is also engulfed in a worsening civil conflict between government troops and the Arakan Army, an armed group that recruits mostly from the majority Buddhist Rakhine population.
The majority of residents were unable to vote on Sunday after elections were cancelled with the government citing the fighting. 
A Rakhine nationalist party, the Arakan National Party, was expected to win most seats where polls did go ahead.

It scored a sweeping victory in the region in 2015 that failed to translate into significant political power and a similar result this time is likely to give further fuel to the insurgency.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization chief welcomed efforts on Monday to strengthen the Geneva-based body through reform and said that it was looking forward to working closely with the administration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden.
WHO's funding must become more flexible and predictable to end a ""major misalignment"" between expectations and available resources, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, citing reform efforts by France, Germany and the European Union.
""We still have a lot of work left to do, but we believe that we're on the right track,"" Tedros told health ministers as the annual meeting resumed of the WHO, which groups 194 countries.
U.S. President Donald Trump has frozen U.S. funding to the WHO and begun a process that would see the United States withdraw from the body next July, drawing wide international criticism amid the COVID-19 crisis. He accuses the WHO of being ""China-centric"" in its handling of the pandemic, which Tedros has repeatedly denied. 
Biden, who will convene a national coronavirus task force on Monday, said during campaigning he would rescind Trump's decision to abandon the WHO on his first day in office. 
Tedros urged the international community to recapture a sense of common purpose, adding: ""In that spirit we congratulate President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and we look forward to working with this administration very closely. 
""We need to reimagine leadership, build on mutual trust and mutual accountability to end the pandemic and address the fundamental inequalities that lie at the root of so many of the world's problems,"" he said.
An oversight panel called last week for reforms at the WHO including ""predictable and flexible"" funding and setting up a multi-tiered system to warn countries earlier about disease outbreaks before they escalate.
Tedros, speaking from quarantine after being in contact with an individual with COVID-19 more than a week ago, began with a minute's silence, noting that COVID-19 cases approached 50 million with 1.2 million deaths. 
Speaking shortly before  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, Tedros said vaccines being developed to curb the pandemic should be allocated fairly as ""global public goods, not private commodities"".

Acting U.N. Libya envoy Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) has described it as the best opportunity in six years to end the turmoil and warfare that have plagued the North African oil exporting country since 2011. 
But she warned at Monday's opening ceremony attended by Tunisian President Kais Saied: ""The road will not be paved with roses and it will not be easy.""
The talks, held among 75 participants chosen by the United Nations to represent an array of political viewpoints, regional interests and social groups, come as the main warring sides discuss how to implement a truce they agreed in Geneva. 
Libya has been split since 2014 between rival factions in the west, held by the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), and the east, home to Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). 
However, both sides are made up of sometimes unstable coalitions with their own interests, and contain figures who might seek to sabotage any agreement they regard as a threat. 
They are also backed by foreign powers with their own concerns that have invested heavily to build up military strength on the ground and strike deals with their local partners. 
Turkey supports the GNA, helping it this summer to turn back an LNA assault on Tripoli backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt. 
After frontlines solidified near the central coastal city of Sirte, both sides began U.N. mediated ceasefire talks. Williams said they had made new progress in implementing the nationwide ceasefire they agreed last month and had set up a headquarters in Sirte to hash out details.
She wants the Tunisia political talks to set a roadmap for elections as soon as possible and establish a single, unified authority across the country that can manage the process. 
Those taking part have pledged not to accept any role in a new transitional government, she said. 
Nearly a decade after central authority collapsed, repeated bouts of warfare have sapped state resources, damaged the water and power networks and worsened a financial crisis, making life wretched for millions. 
As Libya sweltered in August and cases of the coronavirus began to rise, protests broke out on both sides of the frontlines over dire living conditions and corruption. 
""It is necessary to set dates for the elections so that the Libyan people will have the ballot box after the sounds of bullets are silenced,"" Saied said.

Launching the #G20SaudiArabia campaign, HRW called for the unconditional release of Saudi human rights activists, including female activists Loujain al-Hathloul, Nassima al-Sadah and Nouf Abdulaziz as well as blogger Raif Badawi, journalist Salah Haidar and rights lawyer Walid Abu al-Khair.
Rights group say some of the women, including Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement for months and subjected to abuse including electric shocks, flogging and sexual assault.
Saudi authorities have not responded to requests for comment on calls by rights groups for G20 member states to pressure the kingdom on its human rights record. Officials have in the past denied torture allegations and said the arrests were made on suspicion of harming Saudi interests. Few charges have been made public.HRW also demanded Riyadh allow United Nations experts access to assess attacks on civilians in Yemen, and an independent, international body to investigate Khashoggi's murder and review Saudi court documents.

Riyadh has jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years in the case. Prince Mohammed had denied ordering Khashoggi's killing but in 2019 acknowledged some personal accountability by saying it happened on his watch.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 05:49AM ET</span>",Spain to start trial of suspects linked to deadly 2017 van attack,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's High Court will on Tuesday open the trial of three suspected Islamist militants linked to a 2017 attack in Barcelona which killed 14 people - Spain's deadliest in over a decade.
A single attacker drove a rented van into crowds on Barcelona's central La Rambla boulevard, causing 14 deaths and injuring over a hundred people. Another man was killed during the attacker's getaway. 
On the eve of the attack, an accidental explosion destroyed a house in Alcanar, southwest of Barcelona, where explosives and gas canisters had been stored. The blast killed the group's suspected leader, an imam.
Two of the accused, a Spaniard and a Moroccan, face charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation, manufacturing and storing explosives, and attempting to cause widespread destruction, which are all related to the Alcanar blast but not directly to the Barcelona attack, according to court documents. 
Prosecutors are seeking jail terms of 41 and 36 years for the two and eight years for another Moroccan national who is accused of being an accomplice. They have been in prison pending trial since their arrests in 2017 in connection with the blast.
Eulogio Paz, head of one of the victims' associations acting as a civil party in the trial, said on Friday his group was ""going to fight for a murder charge and sentence for the accused ... regardless of whether they were closer or further away from the van"" used in Barcelona.
They demand perpetual sentences for the two main suspects.
The day after the attack on Aug. 17, five militants drove a car into a crowd in the coastal resort of Cambrils and used knives to attack bystanders, killing a woman and injuring several others, before being shot dead by police. Officers also killed the Barcelona attacker a few days later.
The trial, which is expected to run through Dec. 16, comes as various European countries step up security following recent Islamist attacks in France and Austria.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",Ethiopia downplays war fears while seeking to quell Tigray,"By Giulia Paravicini
GONDAR, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Ethiopia's Nobel-winning leader said on Monday his nation was not descending into ""chaos"" despite a military offensive against the restive Tigray region where air strikes and fighting have killed at least half a dozen people in recent days.
The flare-up in the northern region bordering Eritrea and Sudan has brought fears of civil war in Africa's second most populous nation where ethnic conflict has killed hundreds since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took over in 2018. 
""Ethiopia is grateful for friends expressing their concern. Our rule of law operation is aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability once and for all by bringing perpetrators of instability to justice,"" he tweeted on Monday. 
""Concerns that Ethiopia will descend into chaos are unfounded and a result of not understanding our context deeply.""
The 44-year-old, who is the continent's youngest leader, won the Nobel Peace Price last year for democratic reforms following years of repressive government and for making peace with Eritrea after a border war that had killed tens of thousands. 
But the conflict in Tigray threatens national stability. 
Last week Abiy, who comes from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group the Oromo, launched a military campaign saying forces loyal to Tigrayan leaders had attacked a military base and attempted to steal equipment. 
The Tigrayans account for just 5% of Ethiopians but had, before Abiy's rule, dominated politics since rebels from their ethnic group toppled Marxist military rule in 1991. 
Federal government fighter jets have in recent days been bombing targets including arms depots in Tigray. Aid workers on Sunday reported heavy fighting between troops loyal to each side, with at least six dead and dozens wounded.
A military official in Amhara told Reuters that clashes with Tigrayan forces in Kirakir, near the border between the regions of Tigray and Amhara, on Thursday had killed dozens on both sides. Reuters was unable to verify that. 
BATTLE-HARDENED
Forces of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which governs the region, are battle-hardened - from the 1998-2000 war with neighbouring Eritrea and from the guerrilla struggle to topple Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991.
They and militia allies number up to 250,000 men and possess significant stocks of military hardware, according to the International Crisis Group thinktank.
Tigrayans say Abiy's government has unfairly targeted them as part of a crackdown on past rights abuses and corruption.
""These fascist have demonstrated they will show no mercy in destroying Tigrayans by launching more than 10 air strike attempts in Tigrayan cities,"" the TPLF said via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""The people and government of Tigray are standing together,"" it added in the post on Monday.
Abiy, a former soldier who fought alongside Tigrayans against Eritrea, has so far defied calls from the United Nations and others to negotiate. 
One risk is that Ethiopia's army could split along ethnic lines, with Tigrayans defecting to the regional force. 
There are also fears of reprisals against Tigrayans elsewhere. Addis Ababa police said on Sunday the government had arrested 162 people in possession of firearms and ammunition, on suspicion of supporting the Tigrayan forces.
Furthermore, as Abiy's government mobilises troops to Tigray, other areas already roiled by ethnic violence could face a security vacuum, analysts say.
Thousands have had to flee their homes in the last two years in the nation of 110 million people.
Analysts do not believe the clashes will reawaken the Eritrea conflict given that President Isaias Afwerki and Abiy both see the Tigrayan leadership as enemies. ​

All-out war would damage Ethiopia's economy after years of steady growth. Abiy has pledged sweeping reforms to open lucrative sectors such as telecoms to foreign investment.

The Nov. 11 march, which often brings tens of thousands of people onto the streets, is seen as a flash point between nationalists and liberals, and has been marred by violence in recent years.
""Due to all the circumstances, we thought about the formula for a long time. So that everyone can come and celebrate with us this year, we decided to use the car formula,"" Witold Tumanowicz, vice-president of the association that organises the march, told reporters.
Participants are invited to gather in cars and on motorbikes at Rondo Dmowskiego in central Warsaw on Independence Day.
But a spokeswoman for Warsaw city hall said there was not enough time for the association to apply for permission to stage such an event as the process took up to 30 days.
The spokeswoman said all other official events to mark Independence Day - other than the laying of flowers - had also been cancelled due to the pandemic.
Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, a liberal, refused last Friday to authorise the march due to the health risks, and on Saturday a court dismissed an appeal against the ban. The organisers have appealed against that ruling.
Poland has seen spiralling infection numbers, prompting government warnings that a full nationwide lockdown may be necessary. Current restrictions ban gatherings of more than five people.

Despite such restrictions, Polish cities have seen mass street protests in recent weeks against a court ruling that imposes a near-total ban on abortion in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.

The serviceman shot at officers who had come for a morning inspection at the base in the Voronezh region, around 500 km south of Moscow (310 miles), and then fled the scene, news agencies cited the defense ministry as saying.
There were contradictory reports of what happened next. 
Rosgvardia, Russia's national guard, told news agencies that it was searching for the shooter with the help of helicopters and drones.
But the TASS news agency cited an unnamed source in the region's emergency services ministry as saying the soldier had barricaded himself inside the base. 
""The soldier fired using a pistol that he took from an officer. Three people were killed,"" TASS cited the source as saying. 
The motive for the attack was not immediately clear.
Such incidents occur from time to time in the Russian military where some conscripts allege brutal hazing from more senior soldiers, a Soviet-era problem the defense ministry says it has stamped out.
A Russian conscript who shot dead eight fellow soldiers at his army base in 2019 said earlier this year that he had been left with no other course of action after conscripts turned his life into a living ""hell.""
Russian men aged 18-27 are legally required to serve one year in the army. Some Russians go to great lengths to dodge the draft, in part because of fears of hazing despite the government's drive to overhaul the military.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",Former Kosovo president faces war crimes judge after shock resignation,"By Stephanie van den Berg
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Former Kosovo President Hashim Thaci, the rebel turned politician who abruptly resigned last week to face war crimes charges, appears before a judge for the first time in The Hague on Monday.
Thaci led the fight against Serbian forces in 1998-1999 as a commander in the Kosovo Liberation Army and oversaw the country's declaration of independence 12 years ago.
Kosovo's first prime minister, he has been president since 2016, but stepped down to face allegations at the Kosovo Specialist Chambers of responsibility for detaining, torturing and killing wartime opponents to gain political control of the contested region.
Thaci is being held in the same detention centre in the Dutch coastal town of Scheveningen where his main rival, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, died in custody in 2006 during his trial for alleged Balkan war crimes.
Thaci is expected on Monday to challenge the legitimacy of the EU-backed court, which in recent weeks has arrested six other leading former KLA commanders.
Prosecutors say Thaci, 52, was responsible for nearly 100 murders of civilians. He could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted by the tribunal, which has international judges and prosecutors but applies Kosovo law.
Thaci has previously denied all the allegations.
During a hearing starting at 3 p.m. (1400 GMT), 
Thaci will have the charges explained by a judge. He has 30 days to enter a plea.
After initially helping set up the court under pressure from the international community, Thaci has since tried on three occasions to revise the Kosovo constitution to block it.
In Kosovo, many see the KLA commanders as heroes who freed the country from Serbia's repressive regime against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.

The Kosovo tribunal was set up in 2015 to handle cases relating to alleged crimes by KLA members during and after the 1998-99 conflict, which led to Kosovo's independence from Serbia a decade later in 2008.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Kremlin wants final U.S. election vote count before congratulating anyone,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday it would wait for the official results of the U.S. presidential election before commenting on its outcome, and that it had noted incumbent Donald Trump's announcement of legal challenges related to the vote. 
President Vladimir Putin has remained silent on the issue since Democrat Joe Biden clinched the presidency on Saturday, four days after the Nov. 3 election, clearing the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.
In the vote's run-up, Putin had appeared to hedge his bets, frowning on Biden's anti-Russian rhetoric but welcoming his comments on nuclear arms control. Putin had also defended Biden's son, Hunter, against criticism from Trump.
Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Moscow deemed it better to now wait before congratulating anyone. 
""We think it appropriate to wait for the official vote count,"" said Peskov. 
Asked why in 2016 Putin had congratulated Trump soon after he had won the Electoral College and beaten Democrat Hillary Clinton, Peskov said there was an obvious difference this time round. 
""You can see that there are certain legal procedures that have been announced by the current president. That is why the situations are different and we therefore think it appropriate to wait for an official announcement,"" said Peskov.
He noted that Putin had repeatedly said he was ready to work with any U.S. leader and that Russia hoped it could establish dialogue with a new U.S. administration and find a way to normalise troubled bilateral relations. 
""President Putin has repeatedly said he will show respect for whatever choice the American people makes,"" Peskov said.
Moscow's ties with Washington sank to post-Cold War lows in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Biden was serving as vice president under President Barack Obama at the time.

Relations soured further over U.S. allegations that Moscow had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to try to tilt the vote in Trump's favour, something the Kremlin denied.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's ruling party said on Monday it had won enough seats in parliament to form the next government, after reporting a lead based on its unofficial count of votes from the country’s second general election since the end of strict military rule.
Party spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters internal reports showed the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, had won the 322 seats in parliament needed, though no official results had been announced by the election commission.
""We thank the people,"" he said. ""For the people, for the party, this is such an encouraging election result.""
The Election Commission is expected to announce official results later on Monday.
Sunday's election was seen as a referendum on the fledgling democratic government led by Suu Kyi and the NLD, which remains hugely popular at home but has seen its reputation collapse overseas amid allegations of genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority.
Up for grabs in the election are 315 seats in the 425-member lower house and 161 seats in the 217-seat upper house of parliament.
The NLD came to power after a 2015 landslide in which it won a total of 390 seats, a benchmark Myo Nyunt said it expected to exceed, according to data compiled from reports by party agents at polling stations across the country.
A spokesman for the second biggest party, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) could not immediately be reached for comment.
The military, which ruled Myanmar for nearly 50 years until it began withdrawing from civilian politics in 2011, controls a quarter of seats in both houses of parliament, under a constitution it drew up and which Suu Kyi and her allies want to amend.
The NLD had been expected to win but with a smaller margin following the emergence of new parties and ethnic minority parties gaining support in some regions.
SOME UNABLE TO VOTE
In contrast to the wave of optimism that greeted the NLD's landslide win in 2015, Myanmar went into this election under a cloud of a surging COVID-19 outbreak, economic hardship and escalating ethnic conflicts.
Although Myanmar is seeing an average of 1,100 new coronavirus cases a day - compared with a handful in early August - fears of the virus appeared not to dampen Sunday's turnout among the 37 million registered voters.
The Election Commission has yet to release data on turnout but in the biggest city, Yangon, long lines of voters wearing face masks and shields formed from dawn.
But more than a million people across the country were unable to vote after polls were cancelled due to insurgencies.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, a Muslim minority confined to camps and villages in Myanmar's Rakhine State, most without citizenship, were also unable to vote.
The Democracy and Human Rights Party, a Rohingya party, said in a statement it was ""utterly disappointed"" that its people had been disenfranchised.
The election commission has said the polls in areas affected by conflict had to be cancelled for safety reasons and that only citizens were entitled to vote.
Most Rohingya are not considered Myanmar citizens but migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh even though many can trace family roots back many generations.
The United Nations has said there was genocidal intent in a 2017 army crackdown that forced 730,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. 

Myanmar rejects that saying its security forces were carrying out legitimate operations against Rohingya militants.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",Analysis: Russia and Turkey keep powder dry in Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,"By Maria Tsvetkova and Olzhas Auyezov
YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Sensitive to the threat of wider confrontation, Russia and Turkey are for now limiting involvement in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to providing humanitarian assistance and some military aid.
Ankara sees its strong backing for Azerbaijan over the fighting with ethnic Armenians in the mountain enclave as part of efforts to boost Turkey's international clout. Moscow is determined to defend its own interests in the South Caucasus.
But neither wants to be sucked into an all-out war, and private military contractors say Moscow and Ankara are largely turning a blind eye to the role of mercenaries - possibly fighting on both sides - to avoid stoking tensions.
NATO member Turkey, which has stepped up arms supplies to Azerbaijan in recent years, is likely to refrain from deeper military involvement if its ally continues to advance in Nagorno-Karabakh, military and political analysts said.
Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia, also has good relations with Azerbaijan and is unlikely to become directly involved militarily unless Azerbaijan launches a deliberate attack on Armenia, they said.
""The fundamental question is: does the Kremlin want the return of Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan?"" said Pierre Razoux, academic director at France's Mediterranean Foundation of Strategic Studies. 
Thousands are feared killed since fighting flared on Sept. 27 in the breakaway territory, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.
Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said on Sunday his country's forces had taken Shusha, the second-largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Armenian officials denied this but Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan congratulated his ""Azeri brothers"" and said he believed Aliyev's statement was ""a sign"" that Azerbaijan would soon regain control of more territory.
Turkey's support for Azerbaijan has been vital, and Azerbaijan's superior weaponry and battlefield advances have reduced its incentive to reach a lasting peace deal.
Ankara denies its troops are involved in fighting but Aliyev has acknowledged some Turkish F-16 fighter jets remained in Azerbaijan after a military drill this summer, and there are reports of Russian and Turkish drones being used by both sides.
Russia is Armenia's main arms supplier though it also sells weapons to Azerbaijan which, like Armenia, was for decades part of the Soviet Union.
""ALL ASSISTANCE REQUIRED""
Russia has said it will give ""all assistance required"" should the conflict spill onto ""the territory of Armenia"".
A Russian private military contractor, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, cited unconfirmed information from a colleague that Russian mercenaries had gone to Nagorno-Karabakh.
Alexander Borodai, a former leader of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, said a handful of Russian fighters, mostly of Armenian descent, had gone privately to Nagorno-Karabakh but had not stayed long.
""They understood quickly that they wouldn't be properly used there,"" he said.
Moscow and Ankara have cited the presence of foreign fighters as a threat to stability.
After Armenia reported two Syrian fighters had been captured, Russia estimated 2,000 mercenaries from the Middle East were fighting, and Erdogan said Armenia was using Kurdish militants. The reports have not been confirmed independently.
Political analyst Fyodor Lukyanov said Russian involvement was unlikely to match the support received by the separatists in eastern Ukraine and that even an ""accidental hit"" on Armenian territory would not be viewed by Moscow as ""aggressive action"".
Moscow has a pragmatic relationship with Ankara that has overcome past crises and both worry about the security of oil and gas pipelines in Azerbaijan.
But Razoux said deeper Russian involvement would be possible were Azerbaijan to attack Yerevan or Russia's military base in Gyumri, northwest of the capital.
""Russia has established a number of outposts along Armenia's borders to make a statement,"" he said. ""But (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has made it equally clear that this protection does not, and never did, extend to where Armenia really wants support right now - in Nagorno-Karabakh.""
MORE AID FLIGHTS
Humanitarian aid deliveries from Russia to Armenia have increased in recent weeks, according to flight tracking data and two Armenian airline operators.
An IL-76 military cargo plane previously used by the Armenian postal service and now operated by Atlantis Armenian Airlines had flown almost daily between Russia and Yerevan since early October, the airline said. 
On Friday, Reuters reporters saw the plane at Yerevan airport after a flight from Moscow, loaded with three minibuses, four winter tyres and dozens of sacks and boxes marked with red crosses. Labels of many of them identified Armenia's Moscow embassy as the sender. 
Two Airbus A320 commercial jets operated by Atlantis European airlines have also been delivering humanitarian aid from southern Russia since early October.
On Sept. 24, after the joint Turkish-Azeri military drill, flight tracking data showed three Turkish Air Force A400 heavy transport planes making a return trip to the Azeri capital Baku.
Turkey's support for Azerbaijan has had ""a game-changing effect,"" said Laurence Broers, Caucasus programme director at the Chatham House think-tank.

""If the Azerbaijani advance proceeds as it has to date, there won't be a need for further Turkish involvement,"" he said, adding that Turkey ""would probably lend increased support"" if Azeri advances stalled.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's prime minister stepped up a military offensive in the northern region of Tigray on Sunday with air strikes as part of what he called a ""law enforcement operation"", increasing fears of outright civil war in Africa's second-most populous country.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has defied calls from the United Nations and allies in the region to negotiate with leaders in Tigray, home of the ethnic group that dominated the federal government before he took power in 2018. 
Abiy last week launched a military campaign in the province, saying forces loyal to leaders there had attacked a military base and attempted to steal equipment. 
Abiy accuses the leaders of Tigray of undermining his democratic reforms. 
Government fighter jets have since been bombing targets in the region, which borders Sudan and Eritrea. Aid workers on Sunday reported heavy fighting in several parts of the region, with at least six dead and dozens wounded. 
Also on Sunday, Abiy named a new chief of the army, a new intelligence chief and a new federal police commissioner and foreign minister, changes that analysts said brought close allies into top posts as the conflict escalates. 
The premier won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for making peace with neighbouring Eritrea and for introducing democratic reforms in one of Africa's most repressive countries.
But the democratic transition he promised is endangered by the Tigray conflict, the International Crisis Group think-tank warned last week.
In a televised address on Sunday, Abiy urged the international community ""to understand the context and the consistent transgressions"" by the Tigrayan leaders which led the government to undertake ""this law enforcement operation"".
Tigrayans complain that Abiy, who is from the Oromo ethnic group, Ethiopia's largest, has unfairly targeted them as part of a crackdown on past rights abuses and corruption.
Forces of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which governs the region, are battle-hardened and possess significant stocks of military hardware, experts say. 
They and militia allies number up to 250,000 men, according to the International Crisis Group.
One of the biggest risks is that Ethiopia's army will split along ethnic lines, with Tigrayans defecting to the regional force. There are signs that is already happening, analysts said.
The United Nations raised concerns of reprisals against ethnic Tigrayans amid heightened tension in the diverse country in a confidential report dated Sunday and seen by Reuters.
Addis Ababa Police Commissioner Getu Aregaw said Sunday that the government had arrested 162 people in possession of firearms and ammunition, on suspicion of supporting the Tigrayan forces.
The suspects were ""under investigation"", he said in a statement. He did not identify their ethnicity.
The mayor of the capital, Adanech Abiebie, said on Saturday several TPLF members working in her administration had been arrested on suspicion of planning to disrupt the peace.

As Abiy's government mobilises troops to send to Tigray, other parts of the country roiled by ethnic violence could face a security vacuum, analysts say.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican president's hesitation over congratulating Joe Biden on his U.S. presidential election win drew flack from several Latino Democratic lawmakers, warning it risked souring a restart to bilateral ties after years of tension under Donald Trump.
In an apparent bid to avoid friction with Trump, who has often used Mexico as a veritable political piñata, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Saturday that he was going to wait until ""all the legal matters have been resolved"" before commenting on the results of the U.S. election.
Democratic Texas lawmaker Joaquin Castro, head of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee's oversight subcommittee, took to Twitter to categorize the move as ""a stunning diplomatic failure.""
Lopez Obrador's decision comes ""at a time when the incoming Biden administration is looking to usher in a new era of friendship and cooperation with Mexico,"" said Castro, who was a member of President Barack Obama's cabinet.
A Biden presidency is seen as a chance to reset ties under stress since Trump made his first White House bid, tarring Mexican migrants as rapists and gun-runners and vowing to keep them out with a border wall.
Castro was one of at least a half dozen Democratic lawmakers who criticized the Mexican president, including Arizona state senator Martin Quezada who said ""this is beyond disappointing.""
Mexico's foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said the government had been in touch with Biden's and Trump's teams in recent hours and would remain in contact in the coming days. 
""Whether it's keeping the (relationship) with Trump or establishing it with Biden, who has known President Lopez Obrador since 2012, the objective will be to have the best possible relationship,"" Ebrard was quoted as saying by local newspaper Reforma.
Ebrard said Mexico's ties to the United States were strategic, and that Lopez Obrador had demonstrated since taking office how seriously he took the bilateral relationship.
Lopez Obrador has needed to walk a fine line with Trump, whose term is scheduled to end on Jan. 20. Under Trump's administration, Mexico has had to navigate abrupt demands to stem illegal migration or face trade tariffs.
Lopez Obrador came into office in late 2018 promising a more humane touch with the tens of thousands of migrants, mostly Central Americans fleeing from entrenched violence and poverty, that traverse Mexico to get to the U.S. southern border.
But after Trump threatened to upend $600 billion in annual bilateral trade with Mexico, Lopez Obrador used the newly created National Guard military police to help stem the flow of migrants and acquiesced to have migrants wait for their U.S. court dates on Mexican soil.
""AMLO has been a co-conspirator in Donald Trump's efforts to undermine the human rights of vulnerable asylum seekers,"" said Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, using an acronym for Lopez Obrador's name.
His reluctance to comment on the U.S. election results stands in contrast to the wave of congratulations for Biden from other world leaders despite Trump's protests that the election is not over.
Trump has filed a raft of lawsuits to challenge the election results, but electoral officials in states across the country say there has been no evidence of significant fraud, and legal experts say Trump's efforts are unlikely to succeed.

""President Lopez Obrador, American voters have spoken and Joe Biden is our President Elect. He won fair and square. Don't get left behind by the train,"" warned Mexican-born Congressman Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>",'Don't worry' - pro-Trump Taiwan seeks to reassure over Biden,"By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's top China policy maker on Monday sought to reassure nervous lawmakers that Democrat Joe Biden will continue U.S. support for the Chinese-claimed island, which has benefited from strong backing by the outgoing administration of Donald Trump.
Tensions over democratic Taiwan have escalated dramatically since Republican Trump took office four years ago. China was infuriated first by Trump's unprecedented call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen shortly after he won election, followed by increased U.S. arms sales and two visits to Taipei by top U.S. officials in recent months. 
While that made Trump a popular figure with the public in Taiwan, China responded by increasing military drills near Taiwan, including flying fighter jets over the sensitive mid line of the Taiwan Strait, escalating fears of conflict. 
In Taiwan's parliament on Monday, several legislators expressed concerns about a Taiwan policy shift under a Biden administration, with some describing Biden as ""China-friendly"", and others pointing to Biden's opposition to a bill to strengthen Taiwan's security in 1999.
Huang Shih-chieh, from the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, said their main concern was whether U.S. support for Taiwan would change.
""Our biggest worry is that with a Biden presidency he may adjust his policy,"" Huang said. 
But Chen Ming-tong, who heads Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, repeatedly reassured lawmakers a fundamental change in U.S. support for Taiwan was unlikely.
""There's no need to worry about a change of ownership in the White House,"" he said. ""Although there might be some changes in Biden's tactics towards China, there will be no change in its China strategy.""
Chen noted it was former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, who pushed the ""pivot"" back to Asia to challenge a rising China, and that Biden was unlikely to challenge the current geopolitical structure of the U.S.-China standoff.
The United States and Taiwan share the same values, Chen said. 
""Looking at (Biden's) comments and support for Taiwan in the past, we can trust him to continue to reinforce the Taiwan-U.S. relationship."" 
Chen said while Biden was ""generally viewed as China-friendly"" he had also made a lot of criticism about China. 
""Some people only see one side of the story and overlook another.""
Taiwan officials have long worried that Trump was just using the island as a pawn to put pressure on China.
So Biden being in the White House may not be a bad thing for Taiwan, said Lai Shyh-bao, a lawmaker for the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which traditionally favours close ties with China.

""With a Biden administration I think tensions in the Taiwan Strait will be lowered, because he will not think of Taiwan as a big chess piece, like Trump always did,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A month after Lauren mustered the courage to tell her mother she is lesbian, the 26-year-old Shanghai resident came out to a stranger who knocked on her door.
She told the young man, one of 7 million conducting China's once-in-a-decade census, that she and her girlfriend lived together.
Where the questionnaire asked for ""relationship to head of household,"" the man ticked the box for ""other"" and wrote ""couple.""
The interaction with the receptive census taker was affirming, Lauren told Reuters, even if the handwritten note may not be reflected in the final results. Lauren asked to be identified by only her first name due to the sensitive nature of LGBT issues in China.
China decriminalised homosexuality in 1997, but activists are still fighting for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. 
As the world's most populous country attempts to capture demographic shifts, some LGBT couples are seeking recognition in the national census.
The information collection officially began on Nov. 1, with preliminary surveys underway in the weeks prior. 
The National Bureau of Statistics told Reuters that any additional information beyond the predefined responses for the ""relationship to head of household"" category would not be recorded. 
Shortly after that mid-October census visit, Lauren saw on her social feed posters urging same-sex couples to tell census takers: ""They are not my roommate, they are my partner.""
Peng Yanzi, director of LGBT Rights Advocacy China, the NGO behind the campaign, said he hopes same-sex couples can gain visibility in the eyes of their neighbours and the government alike.
""These census takers may have never met, or even heard of, gay people, so if we have the opportunity to talk to them, they can better understand the LGBT community,"" he said. 
""We are a part of China's population.""
While it remains difficult to come out in China, where many LGBT people refer to their romantic partners as roommates or friends, activists say there is a growing acceptance of gay couples. 
""But the system hasn't kept up with the times,"" Peng said. 
Lauren, who works at a tech company in Shanghai, said she felt comfortable speaking honestly about her relationship, but fears it may not be as safe for LGBT couples in more conservative areas to do so.
""I still wouldn't dare,"" one user of the Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) commented on a post about the campaign.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia would welcome President-elect Joe Biden restoring the United States to the Paris climate accord, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday, speaking as he faced renewed pressure himself to boost efforts to cut Australia's carbon emissions.
""We would be welcoming the United States back into the Paris Agreement, somewhere we've always been,"" Morrison told reporters, saying a U.S. return to other global organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO) would also be welcome.
The United States formally withdrew from the Paris climate agreement last week, but Biden has promised to rejoin the Paris pact, and also commit to net zero emissions by 2050.
Although Australia state and territory governments have adopted the same 2050 target for net zero emissions, Morrison's federal government has yet to do so. Australia is a major exporter of fossil fuels, particularly coal, and Morrison said many countries have made qualified climate commitments.
On Monday independent lawmaker Zali Steggall introduced a climate bill to federal parliament seeking a net zero target, saying Australia would be ""the pariah of the international community"" if it didn't strengthen its climate commitments.
Meanwhile, underlining Australia's frustration with the outgoing President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies, Morrison said Australia would welcome the U.S. back to the WHO, and potentially the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, signed by Australia and 10 other countries in 2018. 
On Sunday, Morrison said Australia would also welcome the U.S. engaging with the World Trade Organization, because the way out of a global recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic is ""market-based trade, fair trade, under the proper rules through the World Trade Organization"".
Australia is currently embroiled in a worsening commercial and diplomatic relationship with China, its largest trading partner.
Australian exporters have expressed concern that Chinese importers were warned off buying seven categories of Australian products from November 6.

Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said Chinese authorities had denied an ""outright ban across a sweeping range of product categories"", and products appeared to be moving through Chinese ports at this stage.

The U.S. mission in Geneva last week urged WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to invite Chinese-claimed but democratically ruled Taiwan to the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA).
Late on Sunday, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said the island had yet to get an invite to the virtual meeting of 194 member states.
""The Foreign Ministry expresses strong regret and dissatisfaction at China's obstruction of Taiwan participating in the WHO and the WHO's continuing to neglect the health and human rights of Taiwan's 23.5 million people,"" it added.
The WHO's refusal to invite Taiwan based on political considerations makes a mockery of the body's ""health for all"" claim, the ministry said.
Taiwan is locked out of most global organisations such as the WHO due to the objections of China, which considers the island one of its provinces with no right to the trappings of a sovereign state.
The WHO says it is up to member states whether to invite Taiwan, which has been praised internationally for quickly containing the coronavirus, to observe the WHA meeting.
Backed by the United States, Taiwan has stepped up lobbying this year to take part, angering China.
China's mission to the United Nations in Geneva on Friday denounced the ""distorted"" U.S. remarks on Taiwan, saying the island can only take part if it admits to being part of China, something Taipei's government has refused to do.

The WHO says it cooperates with Taiwan on various health matters including on aspects of the pandemic and that the island has been provided with the help it needs.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s foreign minister arrived in Washington on Sunday for talks with her American counterpart on a visit now overshadowed by Joe Biden’s projected win in the U.S. presidential election.
Speaking to reporters after visiting the Korean War Veterans Memorial, Kang Kyung-wha said it was too soon to predict how the new U.S. administration would handle specific issues, but she didn’t expect Biden to return to former U.S. President Barack Obama’s policy of strategic patience toward North Korea.
""From the public remarks made by several of Biden's aides, I don't believe it intends to return to the strategic patience of the past,"" Kang said, according to Yonhap news agency.
""It should be made based on various progress and achievements made the past three years."" 
Yonhap said Kang would meet Biden’s foreign affairs and security members and discuss cooperation during her unusually long visit to the United States, without elaborating.
Kang's trip came at the invitation from the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who cancelled his planned visit to Seoul last month after President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus.
Her agenda includes sitting with Pompeo on Monday to discuss solidifying the alliance between the two countries and the issues at stake on the Korean peninsula. She had said she would also meet with senators and scholars.

While acknowledging the United States was unlikely ease pressure on China on issues such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong, state-backed newspaper Global Times said Beijing should work to communicate with the Biden team as thoroughly as it can.
The Trump administration had deliberately created tensions in China-U.S. relations, especially after adopting a campaign strategy of pressuring China, which led to ""bubbles"" occurring in U.S.-China policy, it said. 
""We believe it is possible to pop those bubbles,"" it said. ""It's in the common interests of people from both countries and of international community that China-U.S. relations become eased and controllable.""
The Global Times is a tabloid published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, but does not speak on behalf of the party and government.
The China Daily newspaper said in a separate editorial it was ""obvious"" improving ties with China could start from trade, and reviving trade talks was critical to restore some understanding and trust in China-U.S. relations.
""It is one of the last threads linking the two sides. It is notable that neither Beijing nor Washington has ventured to scrap the hard-earned so-called phase one deal they negotiated,"" said the China Daily, the country's official English language newspaper. 
Tensions between the world's two largest economies have intensified over the past year, shaking up technology supply chains and trade relations, and stoking fears that a financial war between the two countries could be brewing. 
The U.S. pressure, along with the global pandemic, have set China on a mission to reduce its reliance on overseas markets and technology for its economic development, as part of a new ""dual circulation"" model of growth to steer its economy. 

""China must become a country the U.S. cannot suppress or destabilize, and make it that cooperation with China is the best option for the U.S. to realize its national interests,"" the Global Times added.

Previous polls have seen the far-right former army captain's support rise, despite what is widely seen as his poor handling of an epidemic that has now killed more than 160,000 Brazilians. 
Polls on Sunday suggested that support may be waning. 
According to a Datafolha poll, undertaken at the start of November and published in the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, his support in Sao Paulo fell to 25% from 29%, while in Belo Horizonte it fell to 35% from 40%, compared with a previous poll taken Sept. 21-22. The margin of error was 3 percentage points, it said.
In Recife and Rio de Janeiro, his support was more stable, the polls showed.
Meanwhile, a separated compilation of data by pollster Ibope, collated by the G1 website, showed on Sunday that Bolsonaro's support has fallen in seven state capitals. 
The largest drops in support occurred in the cities of Salvador and Rio Branco, in which Bolsonaro's popularity fell by 7 percentage points. 

While Bolsonaro has been criticized by health experts for minimizing the severity of the coronavirus and opposing lockdowns in order to keep the economy going, his popularity has been bolstered by a 322 billion reais ($58 billion) payments program, analysts say.

U.S. President Donald Trump, whom Biden beat in the elections this week, has accused Biden and his son Hunter of unethical business practices in China and Ukraine. No evidence has been verified to support the allegations, and Biden has called them false and discredited.
The Helmes' comments were deemed ""crazy"" by Estonia's Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu, who condemned it along with Prime Minister Juri Ratas and President Kersti Kaljulaid.
""I am sad and embarrassed"", Kaljulaid said in a statement, adding that the politicians ""have damaged our relations with our allies and have sown doubt on the Estonian democratic elections"". 
Ratas is dependent on the support of the Ekre party, which holds 19 seats in Estonia's 101-member parliament and has five ministerial portfolios out of fifteen. 
The outspoken Helmes have caused a lot of political turmoil in the administration's 1.5 years in power.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia finally congratulated Joe Biden on Sunday over his election victory, more than 24 hours after he defeated Donald Trump, who had close personal ties with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The former U.S. vice president pledged in his campaign to reassess ties with the kingdom, demanding more accountability over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Riyadh's Istanbul consulate and calling for an end to U.S. support for the Yemen war.
As other Arab states raced to applaud the Democrat challenger, the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman remained silent on the U.S. vote even as he sent warm words to the president of Tanzania on his re-election.
At 1932 GMT on Sunday, Saudi Arabia's king Salman and his son, the crown prince, congratulated Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on winning the presidential election, state news agency SPA reported.
""King Salman praised the distinguished, historic and close relations between the two friendly countries and their people which everyone looks to strengthen and develop at all levels,"" SPA added.
Prince Mohammed's relationship with Trump had provided a buffer against international criticism over Riyadh's rights record sparked by Khashoggi's murder, Riyadh's role in Yemen's war and the detention of women activists.
Those areas may now become points of friction between Biden and Saudi Arabia, a major oil exporter and buyer of U.S. arms.
""The only thing worse than COVID-19 would be BIDEN-20,"" wrote Saudi Twitter user Dr Muna, while many other Saudi users of the social media platform simply ignored the result in the initial hours after U.S. networks called the election for Biden.
A Saudi political source played down the risk of a falling out between the kingdom and the United States, pointing to Riyadh's historic ties with Washington.
But Saudi Arabia's Okaz newspaper offered a sense of the uncertainty about how the future plays out for the kingdom. ""The region is waiting ... and preparing ... for what happens after Biden’s victory,"" it wrote in a front page article. 
The kingdom may not have to wait long. Neil Quilliam, associate fellow at Britain's Chatham House think-tank, said the Biden administration would likely seek to signal early on its discontent with Saudi domestic and foreign policies.
""The Saudi leadership is concerned that a Biden administration and a hostile Congress will carry out a full review of relations, including re-evaluating defence ties and therefore will likely make positive sounds and moves towards ending the Yemen conflict,"" he said. 
Saudi Arabia was an enthusiastic backer of Trump's ""maximum pressure"" of tough sanctions on regional rival Iran. But Biden has said he would return to a 2015 nuclear pact between world powers and Tehran, a deal negotiated when Biden was vice president in Barack Obama's administration.
Abu Zaid, a cashier at a supermarket in Riyadh, said he hoped Biden would take a different approach. ""I am not happy with the Biden win, but I hope he learns from Obama's mistakes and realises that Iran is a common enemy,"" he said.
A Saudi political source said the kingdom had ""the ability to deal with any president because the U.S. is a country of institutions and there is a lot of institutional work between Saudi Arabia and the United States.""
""Saudi-U.S. relations are deep, sustainable, and strategic and not prone to change because a president changes,"" he said. 
Prince Mohammed had denied ordering Khashoggi’s killing but in 2019 he acknowledged some personal accountability by saying that it happened on his watch. Riyadh has jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years in the case.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgian police fired water cannon against hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the Central Election Commission (CEC) on Sunday to support an opposition call for a rerun of Oct. 31 parliamentary elections which they say were rigged.
Some witnesses and TV channels reported that police also used tear gas but police denied the claim.
Small groups of protesters then started throwing stones at the police. The demonstrators had moved to the CEC building from the capital's main Rustaveli avenue, where thousands of people held a peaceful rally.
Police said that protesters tried to storm the CEC building.
""As the protesters used violent methods and did not obey the instructions of the police, the Interior Ministry used proportional force within its powers,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Georgia's ombudsman and public rights defender, Nino Lomjaria, criticised the use of water cannon.
""Using water cannon in cold weather and against peaceful protesters was not justified,"" she told reporters. 
The opposition is demanding the resignation of the CEC chief, Tamar Zhvania, and the calling of fresh elections.
According to official results, the ruling Georgian Dream party won 48.23% of the vote, with the largest opposition party, the United National Movement (UNM), taking 27.18%.
After the result gave the ruling party the right to form a government, eight opposition parties, including the UNM, said they would boycott parliament.
The opposition accuses the ruling party and its supporters of vote buying, making threats against voters and observers and of violations during the counting process. Georgian Dream leaders have denied the accusations.
Protesters moved to the CEC building after the 8 p.m. deadline to dismiss the electoral commission head and to start talks on a fresh vote passed without a response from the government.

The economy of the South Caucasus country of 3.7 million people has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. The government said on Saturday it would impose an overnight curfew from Monday between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in the largest cities due to a sharp rise in cases since early September.

CAIRO (Reuters) - The French foreign minister asserted his country's ""profound respect for Islam"" during a visit to Cairo on Sunday in a dispute with the Muslim world over France's defence of the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad.
Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian's visit comes in the wake of several attacks in France apparently provoked by anger over the defence of the caricatures, considered blasphemous by Muslims, as freedom of expression.
After meeting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, Le Drian said an ""anti-French"" campaign in the Muslim world had often been the result of a distortion of French President Emmanuel Macron's comments on the issue.
""We have a first principle which is the highest respect for Islam,"" Le Drian told reporters. ""I also want to say that Muslims are fully part of society in France.
""The second message is that we're confronted by a terrorism threat, fanaticism, on our soil but also elsewhere, and this battle is a common battle.""
Le Drian said he had a long exchange marked by ""great frankness"" with Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, who heads al-Azhar, Cairo's thousand-year-old seat of Sunni Muslim learning.
""I noted numerous points of divergence in our analyses. I told the Grand Imam how much we need a voice of balance, tolerance and moderation,"" Le Drian told reporters.
French officials later said Le Drian had meant to say ""convergence"", not ""divergence"". 
The only battle France was fighting with Egypt and other countries was against extremism, Le Drian said.
""The Grand Imam suggested that we work together to deepen this common convergence.""
In a written statement about the meeting, Tayeb said he had stressed that any insult against the prophet was unacceptable. 
""I am the first to protest against freedom of expression if this freedom offends any religion, not just Islam,"" he said.

""We refuse to describe terrorism as Islamic,"" he added. ""Al-Azhar represents the voice of nearly two billion Muslims, and I said that terrorists do not represent us, and we are not responsible for their actions.""

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivians celebrated the Day of Skulls over the weekend, a colorful tradition rooted in ancient indigenous beliefs that is meant to bring good fortune and protection by honoring the dead.
Known as ""ñatitas,"" the skulls are decorated and paraded to the cemetery a week after All Saints Day. Some are adorned with sunglasses and cigarettes as well as colorful flowers and hats.
The celebration of the skulls, which are kept indoors most of the year, is believed to have its roots in the Uru Chipaya custom of disinterring the bodies of loved ones at the one-year anniversary of their death.
The festival this year coincides with the inauguration of Bolivia's new President Luis Arce, which caps a turbulent year for the Andean country that has been rattled over the last year by political upheaval and the coronavirus pandemic.
""We come to ask or the devotees come here to ask for the favors they want, especially asking for health and for the well-being of family,"" said Angel Aduviri, celebrating the day, adding the skulls helped people get things they needed.
""In 2014 a person told the skulls that he wanted to be a lawmaker and the skulls granted his wish, the person was elected a lawmaker.""
Traditions and cultures of the Aymara, Quechua and other groups remain strong in Bolivia, where indigenous people are a majority in a country set in the heart of South America.
Arce's socialist MAS party, which was in power for almost 14 years under indigenous leader Evo Morales until he was ousted last year amid protests, has traditionally had strong ties with the country's indigenous groups and movements.

""I have come to visit the Natitas, we come every year, there are many devotees,"" said devotee Rosario Zelaya. ""They are our angels, they take care of us, guide us, help us, protect us and bless us. Obviously first God and then our souls.""

GONDAR, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed replaced his army chief, the head of intelligence and the foreign minister on Sunday as the military continued a five-day old offensive in the restive Tigray region with a new round of air strikes.
Abiy gave no reasons for the personnel changes, which come as he pursues a military campaign against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a powerful ethnic faction that led the ruling coalition for decades until Abiy took office in 2018.
The president of the Tigray region, Debretsion Gebremichael, who is also chairman of TPLF, told Reuters that TPLF would keep on defending itself until federal authorities agree to negotiate.
Abiy's office announced that Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen had been appointed foreign minister, while deputy army chief Birhanu Jula was promoted to army chief of staff.
Temesgen Tiruneh, who was president of the Amhara region, was named new intelligence chief. Amhara regional state forces have been fighting alongside their federal counterparts against the TPLF.
Debretsion told Reuters that the federal government was still pounding some targets with air strikes. ""Federal control is zero within Tigray,"" he said.
The federal government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Debretsion's remarks.
Ethiopia's neighbours fear the fighting could spark a civil war in Africa's second most populous nation and destabilise the Horn of Africa region. 
On Sunday, the central bank ordered the closure of 616 branches of commercial banks in Tigray, citing reports of looting.
Tigrayans dominated Ethiopian politics for decades until Abiy reorganised the ruling coalition into a single party which the TPLF refused to join.
Tensions escalated after Tigray held a regional election in September, which the federal government called illegal. On Wednesday, Abiy launched military operations in Tigray in response to what he said was an attack on federal troops.
HUMANITARIAN DISASTER
Nine million people risk displacement from the escalating conflict in Tigray, the United Nations said in a report published on Saturday, warning that the fighting was blocking food and other aid.
About 600,000 people in Tigray depend on food aid to survive, while a further million receive other forms of support, all of which are disrupted, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.
Clashes between federal troops and Tigrayan forces had broken out in eight locations in the region, according to the report.
Pope Francis expressed concern about the conflict in his weekly address from the Vatican on Sunday.
""I am following with concern the news from Ethiopia. While calling on the temptation of armed conflict to be cast aside, I invite everyone to prayer and brotherly respect, to dialogue and peaceful reconciliation of discord,"" he said.
An Ethiopian military plane bombed a missile and artillery site next to the airport in Tigray's capital Mekelle on Sunday, one military and two diplomatic sources told Reuters. It was not immediately clear what was destroyed in the bombing.
The airplane left a military base in the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region, sources said.
The army was in control of several towns near the border including Dansha and Shire, new army chief Birhanu told a state-run newspaper on Sunday, without saying when the army seized the areas. 
It is not possible to verify the report as communications systems in the Tigray region have been shut down since Wednesday.
Abiy spoke on Saturday with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who ""offered his good offices"", in the quest for a peaceful resolution of the crisis, the U.N. spokesman said. 
The U.N. chief also spoke with the African Union chief Moussa Faki Mahamat and Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in his capacity as chair of the regional Africa group IGAD, the spokesman added.
But Abiy is not listening to requests for mediation, diplomats and security officials in the region have told Reuters. He did not issue a statement on the call with the U.N. chief.

Instead, during his address on TV on Sunday, he called on the international community to ""understand the persistent transgressions"" by the ""TPLF clique"".

ZURICH (Reuters) - The two men arrested in the Swiss town of Winterthur near Zurich last week over possible links to a jihadist shooting attack in Vienna on Nov. 2 visited the attacker in July and he may have visited the Zurich region, Swiss media reported on Sunday.
In Vienna, a court ordered two more people to be remaned in custody in relation to the attack, in which four people were killed, taking the total in custody there to 10, a spokeswoman for the court told Reuters, confirming reports in Austrian media.
The Swiss reports shed a further spotlight on the once prominent industrial centre near Zurich, where officials say a now-shuttered mosque attracted preachers who espoused ""hate speech"". A man dubbed the ""Emir of Winterthur"" was sentenced to 50 months in jail in September for recruiting for Islamic State.
Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag said the two men, aged 18 and 24, travelled to Vienna between July 16 and July 20 to meet the future attacker in an unknown location, citing ""two well-informed people"".
The paper also said the gunman, who was shot dead by police after killing the four people in the centre of the Austrian capital, may have travelled to the canton of Zurich at some point between July 21 and Nov. 2, citing the same two unnamed sources, which it did not specify further.
The SonntagsZeitung newspaper said the two men had visited the Vienna attacker this summer in his flat, without citing sources. ""It is still completely unclear whether the two men simply visited the Vienna terrorist or whether they can be linked to the attack,"" the paper said.
Swiss authorities have said the two men were ""obviously friends"" of the attacker and had met in person, but did not say when.
The Zurich cantonal police declined to comment on the reports and Zurich prosecutors could not be reached. 
Austria on Friday admitted ""intolerable mistakes"" in the handling of intelligence on the attacker.

Vienna police said people from Germany who were being monitored by German intelligence stayed in Austria in the summer and also met the attacker there.

""We believe in the possibility of constructive bilateral relations respecting one another's differences,"" his tweet read, reflecting widespread hopes on the Communist-run island for an improvement in U.S.-Cuban relations under President-elect Biden, without naming him. 
Incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump unraveled much of his predecessor Barack Obama's 2014-2016 detente with Cuba, reverting instead to a decades-old policy of seeking to choke its economy in order to force democratic change. 
The Trump administration tightened restrictions on U.S. travel and remittances to Cuba and sanctioned shipments of Venezuelan oil to the island. 
The administration also made it harder for Cubans to visit their family in Florida by reducing its Havana embassy to skeletal staffing and shutting down the consular section in the wake of mysterious illnesses among its diplomats.
This has meant Cubans have instead had to travel abroad to get a U.S. visa. 
During the campaign, Biden assured he would promptly reverse policies on Cuba enacted by Trump that ""have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights.""
And a top Biden foreign policy adviser told Reuters on condition of anonymity last week that the Democrat would ""reverse the decisions that are separating families, limitations on family travel and remittances"" if he won the White House.

But the adviser added that while the incoming president wants to ""empower"" the Cuban people, ""we can't turn back the clock to January 2017.""

CHENNAI, India (Reuters) - Indians burst firecrackers on Sunday and offered prayers of gratitude over the election of Kamala Harris as the next U.S. vice president, declaring it a proud moment for Indian-Americans.
Harris, born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, both of whom immigrated to the United States to study, made history by becoming the first woman to win election to the post.
At her ancestral village in southern India, about 14,000 km (8,700 miles) from Washington D.C., children clutched posters of Harris as people gathered at a Hindu temple to thank the gods for the victory that she and President-elect Joe Biden won.
Priests at the temple in Thulasendrapuram village bathed the local deity in milk and prayed. Women drew murals in the courtyard and musicians played traditional music. 
""A woman hailing from this small village now holds one of highest positions in U.S. It's a proud moment,"" said R Kamaraj, a government minister in the southern state of Tamil Nadu who joined the celebrations.
Harris identifies herself as a Black American but she has also spoken about her Indian heritage during the campaign. In her victory speech on Saturday night, Harris said her late mother Shyamala Gopalan was the ""woman most responsible for my presence here.""
Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born head of the main opposition Congress party described Harris as a daughter of India in a letter to the vice-president elect, inviting her to visit.
""We hope we will have the opportunity soon to welcome you to India, where you will be warmly hailed not just as a much admired leader of a great democracy, but also as a beloved daughter.""
Harris, who visited her village when she was 5, has often recalled walks with her maternal grandfather on the beaches of the southern city of Chennai during annual trips from the U.S.
Those conversations with her grandfather, who was among millions of people who joined India's independence movement, left a profound impact, Harris said in a 2018 speech.
She has been in close touch with her family in India and her uncle said he planned to attend the inauguration in January.
""It's great (the victory). It was needed and it was good. And the next four years will be good,"" G. Balachandran, a leading defence scholar, told Reuters partner ANI at his home in New Delhi, where like millions of people worldwide, he watched every turn and twist of the election.
""I knew she was going to win. So, I was not tense, except I wanted the final results to come in so that I could go and sleep,"" he said.
In Mumbai, people shot off fireworks and a group of artists painted a portrait of Biden and Harris. 
Dozens of prominent Indians and Americans of Indian origin took to social media to congratulate Harris, including actors Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Mindy Kaling. 

Kaling tweeted images of Harris and wrote ""Crying and holding my daughter, 'look baby, she looks like us'.""

After an initial gathering in the centre of the capital was dispersed by security services, demonstrators spilled out across the city, with groups of protesters staging small demonstrations and holding the red and white flags of the opposition.
Videos showed black-clad security service members carrying batons chasing protesters and taking them away in vehicles. In one shopping centre, law enforcement officials locked the doors and began spot searches of customers, looking for opposition banners and other materials. Security services also stopped and searched cars. Reuters was not able to independently verify any of the footage.
The Viasna Human Rights Centre, which is not registered in Belarus, said around 360 people had been detained.
Among them was Olympic decathlon silver medallist Andrei Krauchenko and kickboxing champion Ivan Ganin, the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation said. Both had previously signed an open letter by 1,000 Belarus sports community members calling for new elections. 
Belarus is in a political crisis as tens of thousands of Belarusians have taken to the streets each week since the Aug. 9 election calling for Lukashenko to resign after 26 years in power. Thousands of people have been arrested and rights groups say hundreds of detainees have reported being subjected to beatings and other abuse.
On Saturday, 60 doctors and other medical staff who had gathered for a rally were detained, according to Viasna.
Belarus last week told the United Nations it was not investigating a single allegation of police abuse, despite coming under Western criticism since the election for violent crackdowns on anti-government demonstrators.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United States is Britain's closest and most important ally, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday, expressing confidence he could achieve much on everything from trade to climate change with President-elect Joe Biden.
Johnson, who was once fondly dubbed ""Britain Trump"" by President Donald Trump, congratulated Biden on his victory on Saturday, saying he looked forward to ""working closely together on our shared priorities"".
But some say Johnson, a leading force in the campaign to leave the European Union, might struggle to forge a close bond with Biden, who has in the past cast doubt over Brexit and has never met the prime minister.
Johnson, his foreign minister Dominic Raab and other members of the governing Conservatives were keen to underline how much overlap there now was between the incoming U.S. administration and that of the British government on shared interests.
""The United States is our closest and most important ally. And that's been the case under president after president, prime minister after prime minister. It won't change,"" Johnson told reporters, adding he had not yet spoken to the president-elect.
He said he looked forward to working with Biden and his team ""on a lot of crucial stuff for us in the weeks and months ahead: tackling climate change, trade, international security. Many, many, many, many, many other issues"".
Raab went further by saying Biden would ""have no greater ally, no more dependable friend than the United Kingdom"". Former finance minister Sajid Javid predicted a much better chance of sealing a trade deal under the new administration rather than the ""protectionist"" Trump.
Britain is pursuing trade deals around the world after leaving the EU in January, to try to project Johnson's vision of a ""global Britain"", but talks with the United States have slowed over the last few months.
Describing himself as a ""keen student of the United States' trade policy"", Johnson said he believed there was a good chance the two sides would ""do something on trade"" despite Washington being ""tough negotiators"".
But it is Britain's trade talks with the EU that might cast a shadow over the relationship between Johnson and Biden, after the U.S. president-elect expressed concerns over whether Britain would uphold Northern Ireland's 1998 peace agreement and said he had hoped for a ""different outcome"" from the 2016 Brexit referendum.
The British government has repeatedly said it will uphold the Good Friday Agreement, which ended 30 years of violence in the British province of Northern Ireland, and on Sunday, Raab accused the EU of putting it in jeopardy.
U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat, told the BBC he expected ""some reconsideration of whatever comments may have been made about the moment of Brexit"".

""The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom has endured over decades and I expect that there will be opportunities promptly for there to be some visits, some conversations.""

The United States on Friday blacklisted Bassil, the leader of Lebanon's biggest Christian political bloc and the son-in-law of President Michel Aoun, accusing him of corruption and ties to the Iranian-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah movement that Washington deems a terrorist group.
A target of Lebanese protests against a political elite accused of pillaging the state, Bassil denied U.S. accusations of corruption and said the issue did not arise in conversations with U.S. officials when they demanded he sever ties with Hezbollah or face sanctions. 
""These sanctions are an injustice and I will fight them and sue for damages,"" he said in a televised speech. ""Sanctions come and go, but compromising national peace and unity is a crime.""
Bassil, who harbours presidential ambitions, heads the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), which was founded by Aoun, and has served as minister of telecoms, of energy and water and of foreign affairs.
The U.S. Treasury Department accused Bassil of being at the ""forefront of corruption in Lebanon"". He was sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets human rights abuses and corruption around the world.
A senior U.S. official has said Bassil's support for Hezbollah was ""every bit of the motivation"" for the sanctions.
The FPM has a political alliance with Hezbollah, which has become Lebanon's most powerful political force. Bassil, who says the group is vital to the defence of Lebanon, reiterated he would not ""stab any Lebanese in the back"".
He said the sanctions should not hold up forming a new government to tackle a financial meltdown, Lebanon's worst crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war.

Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri is navigating Lebanon's sectarian politics to assemble a cabinet needed to implement reforms demanded by foreign donors to tackle endemic corruption, waste and mismanagement to unlock aid.

Shusha, which Armenians call Shushi, is of cultural and strategic importance to both sides and is located 15 km (9 miles) south of the enclave's largest city Stepanakert.
At least 1,000 people have died in nearly six weeks of fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. 
""(This day) will become a great day in the history of Azerbaijan,"" Aliyev said, announcing that Baku's troops had taken Shusha/Shushi. 
In Baku, Azeris gathered in large numbers to celebrate, waving flags and chanting slogans, while drivers sounded their car horns.
Officials from the Nagorno-Karabakh region and Armenia's Defence Ministry denied Aliyev's statement. 
""Shushi remains an unattainable pipe dream for Azerbaijan. Despite heavy destruction, the fortress city withstands the blows of the enemy,"" the Nagorno-Karabakh Rescue Service said. 
Armenia's defence ministry said that heavy fighting for the strategic site continues, while the Defence Army of Nagorno-Karabakh said they had repelled multiple attempts by the Azeri side to advance on the town.
Emboldened by Turkish support, Azerbaijan has the upper hand in the bloodiest fighting in more than 25 years in the South Caucasus. In just over a month, it has retaken much of the land in and around Nagorno-Karabakh that it lost in a previous war over the territory in the 1990s.
Turkish leaders congratulated Azerbaijan on Sunday.
""I congratulate my Azeri brothers' Shusha victory... I believe (it) is a sign that the rest of the occupied lands will be liberated soon too,"" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said, addressing crowds in Turkey's northwestern province of Kocaeli.
The city could serve as a key staging post for an Azeri assault on the enclave's largest city, Stepanakert. Both have come under heavy shelling in recent days. Azerbaijan's defence ministry said allegations that it had shelled civilian areas were 'misinformation'.
The town is also culturally significant to both sides, Thomas de Waal, analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. 

Its population was predominantly made up of Azeris before the previous conflict, making it historically significant for Azerbaijan. For Armenians, it is the site of Karabakh's cathedral, de Waal said.

Tensions have spiked between the United States and Iran since 2018, when Trump exited a nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, and then reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.
""Trump's damaging policy has been opposed ... by the American people. The next U.S. administration should use the opportunity to make up for past mistakes,"" President Hassan Rouhani was quoted as saying. 
""Iran favours constructive interaction with the world."" 
Biden has pledged to rejoin Iran's 2015 nuclear accord with six powers, a deal that was agreed by Washington when he was vice president, if Tehran also returns to compliance. 
In retaliation for Trump's actions, Tehran has gradually reduced its commitments to the accord. But Iran's clerical rulers have said those steps were reversible if Tehran's interests were respected.
""The heroic resistance of the Iranian people proved that the policy of maximum pressure is doomed to failure,"" Rouhani said. 
Biden has said returning to the agreement would be ""a starting point for follow-on negotiations"" and that Washington would then work with allies to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal and address other issues of concern.
Iran's leaders have so far ruled out any talks aimed at further curbing Tehran's nuclear activity, halting its ballistic missile programme and limiting the Islamic Republic’s regional influence.
""The American people have spoken. And the world is watching whether the new leaders will abandon disastrous lawless bullying of outgoing regime - and accept multilateralism, cooperation & respect for law. Deeds matter most,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's Luis Arce will be inaugurated as President on Sunday, capping a tumultuous period for the Andean nation and ushering the socialists back into power after long-term leftist leader Evo Morales was ousted amid angry protests late last year.
Arce, 57, will be sworn in during a ceremony in La Paz, with heads of state from Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia and Spain in attendance, as well as senior officials from Chile, Iran and from the government of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.
The unassuming former economy minister, feted as the architect of Bolivia's rapid growth under Morales, will come into power trying to heal the divisions of a political crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.
Tensions have remained high, especially over changes made by the socialist-controlled Congress to lower the majority needed to pass new laws and the planned return of Morales from exile in Argentina where he has lived since leaving Bolivia last year.
Morales, who led the country for almost 14 years as the first indigenous president, sparked a widespread backlash last year when he ran for an unprecedented fourth term in the face of term limits and a national referendum.
After claiming victory in that election, Morales was eventually forced to resign after angry protests, and the police and military eventually dropping their support for him. He fled the country shortly afterward.
Arce, who was handpicked by Morales and is a close ally, has said that the former president will play no role in his government. Morales is expected to cross back into Bolivia on Monday before proceeding to his rural stronghold in Chapare.

As economy minister, Arce promoted nationalizing strategic sectors such as hydrocarbons and energy, and pushed domestic production with public investments and subsidies, which helped Bolivia grow at one of the fastest rates in Latin America.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - ""God Bless You Donald and Melania"" read the poster hanging over an Israeli highway during the U.S. election campaign. In nearby Palestinian areas, anti-Trump graffiti adorned walls.
Perhaps nowhere outside his own country did President Donald Trump polarise opinion more than in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, where to many he was either hero or villain.
Israel treasures its ties with leaders of the United States, traditionally the country's closest ally. But Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had an especially close public relationship.
That bond meant Trump's face was everywhere in Israel. His image even adorned Netanyahu's own election posters and featured prominently on the Israeli premier's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
""Trump Heights"" was the name given to a new settlement in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, after he recognised Israel's claim to sovereignty over the plateau that was captured from Syria in a 1967 war.
Trump's name also adorns the wall of the U.S. Embassy he moved to Jerusalem in 2018.
Such decisions infuriated Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem as a future capital and considered Trump's backing for Israel as undermining their own goal of statehood. Palestinians had no political contacts with Trump for most of his presidency.
The animosity between Trump and the Palestinian leadership made him a target of protest art.
Huge Trump images - one of the U.S. leader embracing an Israeli watchtower - have been painted on the Israeli military wall that cuts through the occupied West Bank, joining other acerbic political graffiti sprayed on by Palestinians.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on Sunday, hailing a strong alliance that could be burdened by differences over policy on Iran and the Palestinians. 
""Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Joe, we've had a long & warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the U.S. and Israel,"" Netanyahu said on his Twitter account, which still carries a photograph of him and incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump at its head.
Having been in lockstep with Trump for four years, Netanyahu will likely be challenged by any departure by Biden from Trump's tough policy on Iran and toward the Palestinians. Biden has pledged to restore U.S. involvement in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal - which Trump had pulled out of - and a likely opposition by the White House to Israeli settlement of occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood.
Netanyahu thanked Trump in a subsequent tweet:
""Thank you @realDonaldTrump for the friendship you have shown the state of Israel and me personally, for recognizing Jerusalem and the Golan, for standing up to Iran, for the historic peace accords and for bringing the American-Israeli alliance to unprecedented heights."" 
Netanyahu's message came hours after many world leaders had already congratulated Democrat Biden, even as Trump refused to concede and pressed ahead with legal fights against the outcome. 
A spokesman for Netanyahu did not respond to a request for comment on the relative delay. Dani Dayan, Israel's former consul to New York said Netanyahu's slowed response was a precautionary move.
""There is a president in the White House who has not yet acknowledged his defeat and whose whims definitely play a major role in his decision making process and he will be sitting in the White House for another two and a half months,"" Dayan told Army Radio. 
The right-wing Netanyahu's particularly close ties with Trump followed an acrimonious relationship with his predecessor Barack Obama, which some critics have said had alienated Democrats and compromised U.S. bipartisan support for Israel. 
Michael Oren, Netanyahu's ambassador to Washington when Obama was president, predicted warm ties with Biden. ""They will have disagreements over the peace process. They will have disagreements certainly over the Iran nuclear deal but I think their friendship is solid.""
Israel's stock market responded positively to Biden's win. Both the blue-chip Tel Aviv 35 index and the broader TA-125 were up about 0.3% in morning trade.
Still, among Israelis, Trump has won overwhelming popularity and many may be sad to see him go. 

""I think the problem is that Biden will not be as tough or as strong as Donald Trump,"" said Aaron Morali, a student from Tel Aviv. ""He made it hard for the Iranian people to have a nuclear plan but I think with Biden they have someone very easy and I am very, very scared of what will happen.""

In an interview aired to coincide with Remembrance Sunday, the annual commemorations for those who have been killed and wounded in conflict, Nick Carter, Britain's Chief of the Defence Staff, said an escalation in regional tensions and errors of judgement could ultimately lead to widespread conflict.
""I think we are living at a moment in time where the world is a very uncertain and anxious place and of course, the dynamic of global competition is a feature of our lives as well, and I think the real risk we have with quite a lot of the regional conflicts that are gong on at the moment, is you could see escalation lead to miscalculation,"" Carter told Sky News.
Asked if that meant there was a genuine threat of another world war, Carter replied: ""I'm saying it's a risk and we need to be conscious of those risks.""
Carter, who became the British military chief in 2018, said it was important to remember those who had died in previous wars as a warning to those who might repeat past mistakes.
""If you forget about the horror of war, then the great risk I think is that people might think that going to war is a reasonable thing to do,"" he said.

""We have to remember that history might not repeat itself but it has a rhythm, and if you look back at the last century, before both world wars, I think it was unarguable that there was escalation which led to the miscalculation which ultimately led to war at a scale we would hopefully never see again.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai protesters called on King Maha Vajiralongkorn to reach out for dialogue on Sunday as they gathered for the latest demonstration in months of protests, while counter-protesters chanted royalist slogans nearby.
Protests since July have increasingly called for reforms to the powerful monarchy, breaking a long-standing taboo against criticising the institution, as well for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and a new constitution.
""We hope you will change your behaviour once and for all and become a King of all people,"" rights lawyer and protest leader Arnon Nampa said in a letter to the king posted online. ""I hope Your Majesty will open your mind and reach out to dialogue with us to solve the crises together.""
The Royal Palace was not available for comment. It has not commented since the start of the protests, but the king said a week ago that the protesters were still loved and that Thailand was a land of compromise.
Criticism of the monarchy can be punished with 15 years in jail under Thailand's lese majeste laws, but it has become widespread in recent weeks.
Protesters at Bangkok's Democracy Monument were asked to bring letters for the king. Some of the more than 1,000 who gathered there had folded letters into paper darts. Organisers have not said how the messages would be delivered.
Police told a news conference that public gatherings were banned within 150 metres of royal buildings.
Several dozen royalists also gathered on the other side of Democracy Monument, wearing yellow shirts in the colour of the king and waving Thai flags. Many held up pictures of the king and his late father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
""I want to protect the monarchy and the king,"" said Chutima Liamthong, 58. ""The monarchy is the identity of Thailand. We cannot stand without the monarchy,"" she said.
Monarchists see the student-led protesters' demands for reforms to the institution as a way of getting rid it of entirely, although protesters deny that is their goal.
The protesters seek to put the king more clearly under the constitution, reversing changes he made shortly after taking the throne as well as moves he made to take personal control of the palace fortune and some army units.

The protesters say the monarchy has helped enable decades of military domination of Thailand, most recently by approving the premiership of Prayuth, who seized power in a 2014 coup and kept it after disputed elections last year.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2020 02:32AM ET</span>",Myanmar's Suu Kyi favoured to win as election gets underway,"By By Reuters staff
YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar voted in a general election on Sunday seen as a referendum on a fledgling democratic government that remains popular at home but which has seen its reputation collapse overseas amid allegations of genocide.
Leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) is expected to win a second term, following a 2015 landslide that ended more than a half-century of military and military-backed rule.
She has the support of a population that largely sees her as a heroine of democracy for her struggle against dictatorship, though her win will likely be narrower than the victory that propelled her to power.
More than 37 million people are registered to vote, but fears about COVID-19 may dampen turnout, with Myanmar seeing a average of 1,100 new daily coronavirus cases compared to a handful in early August.
In the biggest city, Yangon, queues formed before polling stations opened, with voters in masks, hair coverings and face shields waiting in evenly spaced lines as the sun came up.
Sai Kyaw Latt Phyo, 31, said it was his first trip outside his home in three months. 
""It is worth the risk,"" he said. ""We must take the risk in such a crucial situation for our country.""
Chaw Ei Twin, 38, said she was doing her civic duty.
""I gave my vote to a party which can transform the country. I voted the same party last time,"" she said. 
GRADUAL PROGRESS
Suu Kyi's defenders say critics are unrealistic to expect rapid change in Myanmar and are hampering efforts to secure gradual progress. 
Among the obstacles to some NLD reforms is a constitution that guarantees the military a significant political stake, including control of several key ministries and a 25% quota of legislative seats, allowing it to veto constitutional amendments. 
Suu Kyi and the army have historically been at odds but tensions have been running high lately, with military chief Min Aung Hlaing in a rare interview criticising ""unacceptable mistakes"" in the lead-up to the polls, which the government said risked creating fear and unrest. 
Casting his vote in the capital Naypyitaw, Min Aung Hlaing said he backed the party that ""can work hand in hand"" with the military ""to create a better future"".
""I have to accept the result that comes from the people's wishes,"" he said, when asked if the military would respect the outcome. 
""It is necessary to act with the consideration of how to comfort the worries of the citizens ... That is a must.""
The election commission has said it will try to ensure polls were free and fair, but more than a million people will be unable to vote after polls were cancelled due to insurgencies.
They join hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority confined to camps and villages inside Myanmar's Rakhine state, most without citizenship. 
United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday urged ""peaceful, orderly and credible elections"" that could enable hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during a 2017 army crackdown to return ""in safety and dignity"".
The UN has said there was genocidal intent in that crackdown, which Myanmar says were legitimate operations against militants.
'MOTHER SUU'
NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said the party was happy with the turnout so far. 
""Many voters are saying that they voted NLD,"" he said. ""We always value the decision of the people.""
Nobel Laureate Suu Kyi, 75, is still known to many as ""Mother Suu"" and remains overwhelmingly popular in Myanmar, where a recent survey found 79% of people considered her the country's most trusted figure.
But enthusiasm is weaker in remote regions dominated by ethnic minorities, many feeling sidelined by the Buddhist Bamar-majority central government.
Doi Bu, vice-chair of the newly formed Kachin State People's Party, said the government had brought little change to their region, in part because it was cowed by the army.

""Although five years is not long, the NLD didn't do anything necessary,"" she said.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2020 01:16AM ET</span>",Mexico's president won't congratulate Biden until legal challenges resolved,"By Anthony Esposito and Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Saturday he would not congratulate a winner of the U.S. presidential election until legal challenges are concluded, in an apparent bid to avoid friction with Washington during the transition.
Democrat Joe Biden won the election on Saturday after a victory in the battleground state of Pennsylvania put him over the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes. 
Mexico is the United States' top trade partner, with over $600 billion of annual two-way commerce, and the bilateral relationship with its northern neighbor is by far the most important for Mexico.
""With regard to the U.S. election, we are going to wait until all the legal matters have been resolved,"" Lopez Obrador said at a news conference.
""I can't congratulate one candidate or the other. I want to wait until the electoral process is over.""
Republican President Donald Trump has filed a raft of lawsuits to challenge the results, but electoral officials in states across the country say there has been no evidence of significant fraud, and legal experts say Trump's efforts are unlikely to succeed.
The Mexican president linked his caution to his own allegations of fraud in two presidential elections he contested, in 2006 and 2012, before winning on his third bid in 2018. 
His reluctance to comment on the U.S. results stands in contrast to congratulations offered to Bolivia's former President Evo Morales last year despite opposition claims of fraud in that re-election bid. 
Mexican officials said the decision was borne of a desire to avoid provoking Trump while he remained in the White House. 
""Bolivia doesn't have a 3,000-km border with Mexico,"" an official said of the apparent contradiction. ""It's important to have a couple of months of peace and good neighborly relations.""
In his remarks, Lopez Obrador described the decision as ""politically prudent.""
He said he had a good relationship with both Trump and former Vice President Biden, whom he said he had known for a decade. 
He has needed to toe a fine line with Trump, whose term is scheduled to end on Jan. 20. A Biden presidency could reset ties that have frayed since Trump made his first White House bid, tarring Mexican migrants as rapists and gun-runners and vowing to keep them out with a border wall. 
Under Trump, Mexico has had to navigate abrupt demands to stem illegal migration or face trade tariffs.
However, by acceding to Trump's migration dictates, Lopez Obrador has forged an uneasy relationship of some mutual convenience, in which Washington has mostly avoided criticizing his economic policies.

""President Trump has been very respectful with us,"" he said. ""And we are thankful that he has not meddled.""

The day-long ceremonies at the palace had been scheduled for April but were postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic and have been scaled back as infection keeps rising, although Japan has escaped the explosive outbreak seen in many other countries.
Under Japanese law, only males can inherit the throne, so Naruhito's only offspring, 18-year-old Princess Aiko, is ineligible. Moves to amend the law lost steam when Akishino's wife bore a son, Hisahito, in 2006.
""I deeply ponder the responsibility of Crown Prince and will discharge my duties,"" Akishino in orange robe said in front of attendees, most of whom were wearing masks, according to footages by public broadcaster NHK.
Akishino, 54, is one of just three heirs to the throne along with Hisahito, 14, and Prince Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY), 84, the younger brother of Emperor Emeritus Akihito, who stepped down last year in Japan's first abdication in two centuries.
Changes to the succession law are anathema to conservatives, but debate over how to ensure a stable succession is likely to intensify.
One option is to allow females, including Aiko and Hisahito's two elder sisters, to retain their imperial status after marriage and inherit or pass the throne to their children, a change that surveys show most ordinary Japanese favour.

Conservatives want to revive junior royal branches stripped of imperial status after the war.

SAN CRISTOBAL VERAPAZ, Guatemala (Reuters) - Fresh landslides have halted Guatemalan rescue workers' efforts to dig through mud as much as 50 ft (15 meters) deep to reach houses swamped by a devastating storm that has killed dozens of people across Central America and southern Mexico.
Storm Eta's torrential downpours toppled trees, engorged swift-moving rivers, and ripped down parts of a mountainside above the village of Queja in the central Guatemalan region of Alta Verapaz, burying dozens of people in their homes.
The rains triggered more mudslides in Queja late on Saturday, and the head of a local emergency worker team said rescue efforts had been called off, possibly permanently.
""We are coordinating so that all the personal are evacuated in the morning because we can't work there. If we stay, lives will be lost,"" said the emergency worker, Juan Alberto Leal.
Some of the houses in Queja are under 50 feet of mud, Leal said, with relentless rain making the soil too loose to safely work, and new landslides forcing workers to flee to safer ground in the village. 
Gloria Cac, a member of the Poqomchiʼ people and a resident of Queja, said 22 family members were missing after the mountain collapsed.
""All her family is gone, she's the only survivor. Her dad, mom, siblings, aunts and uncles, grandparents, they're all gone. Twenty-two family members and it's just her alive,"" a visibly distraught Cac, carrying a small child in her arms, said through an interpreter in a recorded video.
Queja had been home to about 1,300 people, according to government data. Not all its houses were destroyed, and most survivors have already been evacuated, officials say.
""At ground zero there is a terrible reality,"" said Francisco Muz, a retired general who was helping in the rescue efforts.
The weather front spread destruction from Panama to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Mexico, has continued to push the death toll higher in those countries. It now stands above 65.
In the Mexican state of Chiapas, flooding has killed 19 people, many swept up by rivers whose banks burst, state authorities said. North of Chiapas in Tabasco state, the deluges killed two more people, the federal government said.
The devastation harked back to Hurricane Mitch, which killed some 10,000 people in Central America in 1998.
President Alejandro Giammattei on Friday suggested up to 150 people could have been buried in the Queja landslide. 

Guatemalan disaster relief agency Conred said 103 people were known missing and 21 confirmed dead in the country.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When reality TV star Donald Trump took office he quickly cast Iran as a main villain of his presidency - ultimately abandoning a landmark deal aimed at stopping Tehran from developing nuclear weapons and putting an economic squeeze on the Islamic Republic.
Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the 2015 accord, agreed by Washington when he was vice president, if Iran also returns to compliance. But diplomats and analysts said it was unlikely to happen overnight as the distrustful adversaries would both want additional commitments from each other.
""It won't be so quick and easy for both sides to get back into compliance. It will take, probably, six months or so and it's possible that they won't be able to reach agreement,"" said Robert Einhorn, an arms control expert at the Brookings Institute.
Biden secured enough Electoral College votes on Saturday to claim the presidency, prompting Iran's first vice president to say he hoped for a change in ""destructive U.S. policies.""
In the deal with the United States and other world powers, Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. It began breaching the nuclear deal after the Trump administration quit in 2018 and started ratcheting up unilateral sanctions on Tehran.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said he wants the United States to rejoin the accord, but told CBS News on Monday that ""re-engagement does not mean renegotiation"" because ""if we wanted to do that (renegotiate), we would have done it with President Trump four years ago.""
Biden has said that returning to the agreement would be ""a starting point for follow-on negotiations"" and that Washington would then work with allies to strengthen and extend the nuclear deal and address other issues of concern.
""If Iran chooses confrontation, I am prepared to defend our vital interests and our troops. But, I am ready to walk the path of diplomacy if Iran takes steps to show it is ready too,"" Biden wrote on CNN's website in September. 
Iran has demanded compensation for the ""damages"" it has suffered under the renewed U.S. sanctions, implicitly arguing Washington should repay it for the lost oil revenues, something any U.S. president would find difficult if not impossible.
""Expectations will be raised from all sides,"" said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""The priority for everybody should be to convince and to push Iran to get back to its nuclear commitments."" 
Trump has also added new penalties https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27C331, including last month when he blacklisted parts of Iran's petroleum industry - which were already on U.S. blacklists - under additional counterterrorism authorities that may be harder to reverse.
'GREAT SATAN'
Iran's economy has been reeling under pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. sanctions and a drop in oil prices. Biden has said he would make sure U.S. sanctions do not hinder Iran's efforts to contain the coronavirus.
Iranian officials said any talks would have to take place after Iran's presidential election in mid-2021, which anti-U.S. security hawks are expected to win.
""I think what the Iranian leadership will try to do is balance the acute needs of its economy with a kind of strategy of negotiating with the Great Satan,"" said Henry Rome, an expert on the Iranian economy at Eurasia Group risk consultancy.
Trump ripped up the nuclear deal, dubbing it an embarrassment to Washington, because he wanted to strike a broader accord that would also address Iran's missile program and regional activities.
The United States has accused Iran of meddling in conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere. A United Nations report in June determined that cruise missiles used in several attacks on oil facilities and an international airport in Saudi Arabia last year were of ""Iranian origin.""
Biden has said he would ""continue to use targeted sanctions against Iran's human rights abuses, its support for terrorism and ballistic missile program."" 
Under the nuclear deal, a United Nations arms embargo on Iran was lifted last month. The Trump administration was left isolated at the 15-member U.N. Security Council after failing to extend the conventional weapons ban.
The Trump administration has also argued that the council should ban Iran from working on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. A 2015 U.N. resolution endorsing the nuclear deal ""called upon"" Iran to refrain from such work, but some states argue that language does not make it obligatory.
Any progress made by Iran on its nuclear program since walking back some of its commitments under the 2015 deal would be dealt with by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said diplomats. 
Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said the nuclear deal could be restored. 

""If you want to get it done, you can figure that out,"" he said, saying that sometimes in Washington ""problems that are complex - but solvable - become unsolvable when people aren't interested in really getting to yes.""

BAGHDAD/RIYADH (Reuters) - Arab leaders congratulated Joe Biden on his election victory, but some people in the Middle East expressed cynicism over U.S. policy even if he pursues diplomacy rather than President Donald Trump's blunt approach to the region's myriad problems.
“I was positive that Trump will not make it to a second term. He was too hostile almost towards everybody. He is (more) fit to be a mafia leader than a president of the United States,"" said Adel Salman, 40, a high school English teacher in Baghdad.
""Let’s wait and see with the Biden presidency. And I’m saying to all Iraqis don’t count your chickens before they hatch. Is Biden better for Iraq? Let’s wait and see his acts.""
Biden may face some of his most complex foreign policy challenges in the region: from wars in Libya and Yemen to reassuring the United States' Gulf Arab allies that Washington can protect them from enemy Iran, even though he has said he would return to the international nuclear deal with Tehran.
""Trump was our friend, he loved Saudi Arabia and protected it from enemies. He handcuffed Iran. Biden will let Iran free again and this will hurt us and the whole region,"" said Mohamed Al Anaizy, a Saudi Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver.
HUMAN RIGHTS
While Trump had cozy relationships with what critics say are increasingly authoritarian leaders in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, Biden has promised to take a tough line on human rights.
Some critics of Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi expressed hope that U.S. policy would change, reposting a tweet by Biden from July in which he criticized Cairo's crackdown on political activists, and pledged: “No more blank checks for Trump’s ‘favorite dictator.’”
Sisi's government has denied accusations by human rights groups of widespread abuses.
Talk show hosts on Egypt’s tightly controlled TV channels have tried to play down the impact of a Biden victory, arguing that Egypt will adjust and adapt. 
Sisi was quick to congratulate Biden. The leaders of Iraq, United Arab Emirates and Jordan also congratulated Biden. 
Lebanese President Michel Aoun congratulated Biden and voiced hope for a ""return to balance in American-Lebanese relations"" during his term.
Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of An-Nahar newspaper, told Reuters that the timing of the announcement of U.S. sanctions on Friday on Aoun’s son-in-law Gebran Bassil, a prominent Christian politician, sent a message that Washington would continue to go after Lebanese politicians over accusations of corruption and aiding Hezbollah.
“Biden is more flexible and rational, but I do not expect fundamental changes, though there may be an easing of pressure with respect to sanctions until Biden’s Middle East team is in place,"" he said.
Ibrahim Matraz, a Yemeni journalist, was also pessimistic about prospects for a shift in U.S. policy after years of conflict that have ravaged his country. 
""We shouldn’t forget that Biden was vice president in Obama’s administration when the war began.""
Trump's allegations of fraud in the election without providing evidence prompted some Arabs to say Washington had no right to preach about democracy in their countries, where leaders often win 99 percent of the vote in rigged elections.

""These elections show the real face of America, a country where elections are a farce with the loser not conceding defeat and claiming he won,"" said Adel al Natour, an industrialist in war-torn Syria, whose leaders face stringent U.S. sanctions.

BERLIN/LONDON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Some of the United States' biggest and closest allies quickly congratulated Joe Biden on his presidential election victory on Saturday even though Donald Trump, with whom several have had rocky relations, had yet to concede.
Germany, Canada and France, which have had strained ties with the Trump administration despite being its G7 and NATO partners, were among the first to recognise Biden's victory, soon after major U.S. television networks declared it.
""I look forward to future cooperation with President Biden,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement on Twitter. ""Our transatlantic friendship is irreplaceable if we are to master the great challenges of our time.""
Merkel's finance minister, Olaf Scholz, went further, suggesting a Biden administration could mark a reset of trans-Atlantic ties. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he looked forward to tackling ""the world's greatest challenges"" with the new administration, including climate change, an issue with which many nations have argued over with Trump.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has had a much smoother relationship with Trump, also picked up the theme of climate change in congratulating Biden.
""The U.S. is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security.""
Washington formally quit the Paris accord on limiting greenhouse gas emissions on Wednesday, fulfilling a pledge by Trump to withdraw the world's second-largest emitter from the pact. Biden has promised to rejoin the agreement if elected.
""The Americans have chosen their President,"" French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted. ""We have a lot to do to overcome today's challenges. Let's work together!""
Many leaders did not mention Trump, but Spain's far-left deputy prime minister, Pablo Iglesias, said his departure as president would leave the far right weakened around the world.
""Trump is confirmed to have lost the election. This is good news for the planet, as the global far right loses its most powerful political asset,"" Iglesias tweeted.
IRISH AND INDIAN PRIDE
Ireland, where Biden traces his family roots, called him the 46th U.S. President, despite Trump accusing Biden of ""rushing to falsely pose as the winner."" Trump has complained of electoral fraud without providing evidence. 
""Ireland takes pride in Joe Biden's election, just as we are proud of all the generations of Irish women and Irish men and their ancestors whose toil and genius have enriched the diversity that powers America,"" Prime Minister Micheal Martin said in a statement.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi singled out Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, in his congratulatory tweet. Harris, whose mother emigrated from India, becomes the first woman, first Black American and first Asian American to win the second highest U.S. office of Vice-President.
""Your success is path-breaking and a matter of immense pride not just for your chittis, but also for all Indian-Americans,"" Modi wrote, using the Tamil word for ""aunts"" which Harris had used when she accepted the Democratic Party's VP nomination.
Egypt, one of Washington's biggest allies in the Middle East, also congratulated Biden, as did Lebanon, which has had fraught relations with the United States.
On Friday, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Gebran Bassil, the leader of Lebanon's biggest Christian political bloc and son-in-law of President Michel Aoun, accusing him of corruption and ties to armed Shi'ite group Hezbollah.
Aoun said on Twitter that he hoped the balance in Lebanese-American relations would return under a Biden administration.
TRUMP ALLIES, RUSSIA MORE CAUTIOUS
Some nations with closer ties to Trump were quiet on Saturday night or reluctant to proclaim Biden as president-elect, though Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid thanks to Trump at the end of his congratulations to Biden.
Polish President Andrzej Duda congratulated Biden on running ""a successful presidential campaign"" and said Poland would maintain a high-quality strategic partnership with Washington as ""we await the nomination by the Electoral College"".
Russia, though, gave no immediate comment. U.S. intelligence officials accuse the Kremlin of intervening in the 2016 campaign to help Trump get elected -- allegations that it denies.
In the run-up to the vote, President Vladimir Putin seemed to hedge his bets, frowning on Biden's anti-Russian rhetoric but welcoming his comments on nuclear arms control. Putin also defended Biden's son, Hunter, against criticism from Trump.
Israeli and Saudi governments, whose leaders are among the closest Trump allies in the Middle East, were also quiet -- as was Hungary's Viktor Orban, who had endorsed Trump's re-election bid and accused Biden's Democrats of ""moral imperialism"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made no immediate comment, and a picture of him and Trump remained at the top of the hawkish Israeli leader's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said he looked forward to work with Biden on seeking peace in neighbouring Afghanistan.

The Trump administration has been drawing down U.S. troops from Afghanistan in a deal with Taliban insurgents, which Kabul and its allies have long regarded as backed by Pakistan.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Drivers honked their horns and applause erupted in Havana on Saturday after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the U.S. presidential election, reflecting hopes on the Communist-run island that he would seek to improve U.S.-Cuban ties.
Many Cubans say they do not expect the Democratic former U.S. vice president to lift the decades-old American trade embargo on the Cuba or that bilateral relations will return to the heady days of detente under former President Barack Obama.
But they feel encouraged by Biden's assurances he will promptly reverse President Donald Trump's policies that ""have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights."" 
""I'm tremendously happy,"" said Miriam Corrales, 68, a retired economist, who applauded after the news was announced on Cuban state television.
""Biden gives me the impression he will do everything possible to ease sanctions and leave behind the pressures we experienced with Trump.""
The Trump administration unraveled much of Obama's detente, reverting instead to a decades-old U.S. policy of choking Cuba's already inefficient state-run economy to force democratic reforms, exacerbating shortages of even basic goods. 
""Trump wanted to bury us alive,"" said Mercedes Rodríguez, 43, a teacher whose livelihood, like that many of many Cubans, was directly impacted by Trump's measures. Her sister in the United States sends money every few months to supplement her low salary. But just 10 days before the Nov. 3 U.S. election, the Trump administration announced measures that will likely prevent U.S. money transfers to Cuba.
A top Biden foreign policy adviser told Reuters on condition of anonymity last week that the Democrat would ""reverse the decisions that are separating families, limitations on family travel and remittances"" if he won the White House.
That suggests, amongst various measures, that Biden could re-staff the U.S. embassy in Havana, which the Trump administration reduced to skeletal staffing after a series of mysterious illnesses among diplomats stationed there. 
That move had forced Cubans to go abroad to get visas to visit their families within the large Florida diaspora.
'ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT' 
Norma Hernandez is among the many Cubans working in the Caribbean island's key tourism sector who hope Biden will also ease Trump's restrictions on non-family U.S. travel to Cuba. Reservations at her bed-and-breakfast have fallen 80% over the past four years. 
Benjamin Gedan, a former National Security Council official under Obama and now a scholar at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, said he expected ""a return to the belief that economic engagement gives more autonomy to Cubans from the state and starts a longer process of potential political opening"". 
Under Obama, remittances and U.S. travel had fostered the expansion of Cuba's fledgling private sector, giving citizens start-up capital and a generous clientele.
But the Biden adviser who spoke to Reuters added that while the incoming president wants to ""empower"" the Cuban people, ""we can’t turn back the clock to January 2017.""
Asked whether Biden would ease or lift sanctions that Trump imposed on Cuba, including on oil tanker traffic from Venezuela to Cuba, the adviser said: ""We’ll have to take a look there at the whole landscape, what we inherit.""
Whatever steps Biden does take towards improving relations, it's important they be reciprocated by the Cuban government this time, unlike under Obama when they were not, said Ricardo Herrero, executive director of the Cuba Study Group, a Miami exile organization which supports closer U.S.-Cuban ties.

""It’s the only way to make relations resilient against the stresses of political polarization in the United States,"" he said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Just two weeks ago, Joe Biden was the butt of a jibe made by U.S. President Donald Trump during a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
""Do you think 'Sleepy Joe' could have made this deal?"" Trump asked Netanyahu in a televised phone call with his closest foreign ally about a Middle East peace initiative.
Netanyahu demurred, apparently hedging in case of a Biden victory. It was a wise move: Declared winner of the U.S. presidential election by major television networks on Saturday, Biden is the one laughing now.
Unlike many world leaders, the hawkish Israeli leader made no immediate comment after the U.S. networks called the election for the former vice president, and a picture of Netanyahu and Trump remained at the top of the Israeli prime minister's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Trump, who has made repeated claims of electoral fraud without providing proof, immediately accused Biden of ""rushing to falsely pose as the winner.""
Still, Israeli Justice Minister Avi Nissenkorn - a member of Netanyahu's ruling coalition belonging to the centrist Blue and White party - swiftly congratulated Biden.
""Congratulations to US President-elect Joe Biden! Congratulations to Kamala Harris, the first woman to serve as vice president and congratulations to the American people on the proper democratic process,"" Nissenkorn wrote on Twitter.
Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also offered his congratulations on Twitter.
""The relationship between our countries is based on deeply held values and critical shared interests which I know will be at the heart of your administration,"" Lapid wrote.
POLICY DIFFERENCES
Though Biden describes himself as a Zionist and friend to nine Israeli prime ministers, friction could arise. 
Netanyahu famously feuded with Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, and he may experience policy whiplash after four years of being in lockstep with Trump - whom he praised before the election for having ""isolated Iran, confronted its aggression, recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, recognised our sovereignty over the Golan Heights."" 
However points of difference on Mideast issues may be deferred because both Biden and Netanyahu face crises over COVID-19 and their economies.
Among the points of disagreement are Biden's pledge to restore U.S. involvement in the Iran nuclear deal, and his likely opposition to Israeli settlement of occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood.
The rightist Netanyahu has no appetite for Palestinian statehood, which would require curtailing the West Bank's Jewish settlers.
As vice president in 2010, Biden condemned Israel's plan to build 1,600 homes in Ramat Shlomo, a settlement in East Jerusalem. Today, an expanded Ramat Shlomo has 16,000 residents and its own highway overpass.
But shelving chunks of Trump's Mideast policy may not mean that Biden hastens to offer an alternative.
He has already said he will not reverse Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
And Biden has pledged not to condition U.S. assistance for Israel on policy changes. That suggests his disapproval of settlement activity may remain declarative.
“The Obama administration couldn’t really work up the energy to push the ‘peace process,’” said Reuel Marc Gerecht of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ”Joe Biden will be 78 years old on Inauguration Day. He’s been around this block. It’s too exhausting.”
One Biden adviser said that as a stopgap, the president-elect may signal to Palestinians that he will put them on a more even footing with Israel.
Regarding Iran, Daniel Shapiro, U.S. ambassador to Israel under Obama, told Reuters: ""Ensuring Iran does not get nuclear weapons remains a priority, and obviously ensuring Israel's security and working to at least preserve the two-state solution."" 

He said there would likely be ""prioritisation” of these behind more pressing U.S. domestic problems.

BALLINA, Ireland (Reuters) - COVID-19 restrictions may have shut the pubs in the western Irish town of Ballina but that did not stop Joe Biden's ancestral home from celebrating his presidential election victory on Saturday.
Biden's great-great-grandfather Edward Blewitt grew up in the old market town, the birthplace of Mary Robinson, Ireland's first female president. Blewitt emigrated after the Irish potato famine of the 1840s to Biden's birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, a sister city of Ballina.
A large painted mural of Biden has overlooked the County Mayo town's square for weeks and locals surrounded by American flags and 'Biden/Harris' posters popped champagne on Saturday. One drove a blue Mustang car with the license plate ""Biden #1"" .
""Probably the best day of my life,"" said Laurita Blewitt, a third cousin who was invited by the former vice president onto the campaign trail earlier this year and was in the White House when Biden received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2017 from Barack Obama.
""It's just the best thing ever. His Irishness is very much attached to him and I know he will try and get over as quick as he can and we will be thrilled to have him here,"" said Blewitt, who spoke to Biden's brother Jimmy shortly after he was declared the victor.
Blewitt's brother, a plumber also named Joe, redecorated his van with the slogan: ""Joe Biden for the White House and Joe Blewitt for YOUR HOUSE.""
Biden brought his children and grandchildren on an official trip to Ireland in 2016 to learn more about their Irish roots, that also include family in the east coast county of Louth and an ancestral link to Ireland rugby players Rob and Dave Kearney.
His win was also warmly welcomed by the Irish government. Biden has warned Britain that it must honour Northern Ireland's 1998 peace agreement as it leaves the European Union or there will be no separate U.S. trade deal.
""He's as Irish as you can get,"" Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said, referencing the tradition Biden started of hosting the Irish premier of the day for a St. Patrick's Day breakfast in the vice president's residence each year. 

""Ireland takes pride in Joe Biden's election, just as we are proud of all the generations of Irish women and Irish men and their ancestors whose toil and genius have enriched the diversity that powers America.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Palestinians have been holding out for a change of U.S. president for three years, hoping for a chance to hit the reset button on relations with Washington.
There was no response from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas after Joe Biden was declared winner of the U.S. presidential election by major television networks on Saturday, but the first key decision facing Abbas is whether he will resume political contacts with the United States. 
Three years ago Abbas cut off contact with President Donald Trump's White House, accusing it of pro-Israel bias over Trump's decisions to break with decades of U.S. policy by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moving the U.S. Embassy to the city.
""We don't expect miraculous transformation, but at least we expect the dangerous destructive policies of Trump to totally stop,"" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's Executive Committee.
""They should change course and deal with the Palestinian question on the bases of legality, equality and justice and not on the basis of responding to special interests of pro-Israeli lobbies or whatever,"" she added.
In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinian cobbler Imad Haj Muhammad was delighted to see Trump go, even though he made money by selling shoes with Trump's name on them, a mark of disrespect in Arab culture.
But Haj Muhammad, 57, remains cautious about a Biden presidency, and had a message for him. “We hope the American administration will change its policies regarding the Palestinians. Do not support the occupation,"" he said.
JERUSALEM AND REFUGEES
Other Trump decisions that infuriated the Palestinians were cutting aid, de-funding the United Nations agency that deals with Palestinian refugees, and closing the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington.
Trump also published a Mideast blueprint in January that envisaged Israeli sovereignty over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, territory that Palestinians seek for a state.
Biden has said he will restore funding to the West Bank and Gaza.
He has also in the past opposed Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and backed a two-state solution to the conflict, a formula that would see a future state of Palestine co-existing alongside Israel.
But he is not likely to move the U.S. embassy back from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv.
And he has welcomed Israel's recently announced ""normalisation"" deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan, which the Palestinians have condemned.
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Islamist group that controls Gaza, urged Biden to “correct the unjust U.S. policies that made the United States a partner in injustice and aggression”.
But with Abbas still silent, it is unclear whether his Palestinian Authority will resume ties with the White House or with Israel.
Hani al-Masri, a Palestinian political analyst, said it would be difficult for the Palestinians to continue their boycott, even though expectations of Biden remained modest. 

""Biden's policies may appeal to Palestinians ... but he will not wade into the conflict given the presence of a (right-wing) government in Israel, which will be a great obstacle to him. He will not be willing to exert pressure on Israel,"" he said.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",China unlikely to find Biden a soft touch,"By David Brunnstrom and Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In his unsuccessful campaign for re-election, President Donald Trump repeatedly warned that a victory for Joe Biden would be a win for China and that Beijing would ""own America.""
Despite that rhetoric, there is little to suggest Beijing will find Biden a soft alternative to Trump, who dramatically shifted the U.S. narrative to confront the world’s second-largest economy in his final year in power.
Even before Trump took office, the last Democratic administration of President Barack Obama and then Vice President Biden had significantly hardened its attitude towards China. 
After initial efforts to engage Beijing, Trump's administration took this further, pushing back forcefully against China's efforts to spread its influence globally, earning some grudging praise from Biden advisers despite a bitterly fought election campaign. 
Biden has not laid out a detailed China strategy, but all indications are he will continue the tough approach to Beijing. 
Diplomats, analysts and former officials who advised the Biden campaign do though expect a more measured tone after Trump’s hip-fired threats, and an emphasis on “strategic competition” rather than outright confrontation.
That said, Biden has at times gone even further than the outgoing president in attacking China.
He has referred to Chinese President Xi Jinping as a ""thug"" and vowed to lead an international campaign to ""pressure, isolate and punish China."" His campaign has also labeled China’s actions against Muslims in Xinjiang ""genocide"" – a step further than current policy, with significant implications if that designation is formalized.
""The United States does need to get tough with China,"" Biden said in an article published in March as the coronavirus pandemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, took hold.
""The most effective way to meet that challenge is to build a united front of U.S. allies and partners to confront China's abusive behaviors and human rights violations.""
In the same sentence, Biden also wrote of seeking ""to cooperate with Beijing on issues where our interests converge, such as climate change, non-proliferation and global health security.""
'GOING TO BE BIG DEBATES'
Reconciling those aims will be the key challenge, with the potential to touch off the sort of disputes between hard-liners and pragmatists seen in the Trump administration.
""There are going to be big debates,"" said a former senior Obama administration official who worked closely with Biden in the past. 
""You will have folks in the Biden team who will say China represents a systemic threat to the United States and we have to treat them as such, and there will be pragmatists saying, 'We're in the middle of a pandemic, climate change is accelerating, we have to work with them.'""
Whereas the outgoing administration's tendency has often seemed to be to launch unilateral attacks on Beijing then to browbeat allies and partners into supporting them, Biden will aim to engage allies at the outset and reassert U.S. leadership via international institutions Trump disdained.
Top Biden advisers told Reuters he would immediately consult with key allies before deciding on the future of tariffs on China, seeking “collective leverage” to strengthen his hand.
""A Biden administration’s China policy will be more predictable and strategic,"" said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. diplomat and trade negotiator.
""The days of advisers scrambling to implement what they learn through presidential tweets will be in the past. The days of throwing one sanction after another at the wall and seeing what sticks without a strategic framework will be over as well.""
While analysts say much of the detail of future China policy will depend on who Biden names to key positions, the focus on rebuilding bruised alliances will be a fundamental tenet. 
Contenders for top positions and Biden himself stress that to work, the approach must be underpinned by domestic investment to ensure a U.S. competitive edge over China in key technologies such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence and 5G.
Michele Flournoy, a hawkish contender for defense secretary, has warned that the economic damage caused by the pandemic mean future defense budgets will be flattened or worse, while stressing the need for U.S. forces to be able and willing to carry through on any deterrent threat.
""If the U.S. military had the capability to credibly threaten to sink all of China’s military vessels, submarines, and merchant ships in the South China Sea within 72 hours, Chinese leaders might think twice before, say, launching a blockade or invasion of Taiwan,"" she wrote in the June edition of Foreign Affairs.
Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia in the first Obama administration, told London's Policy Exchange think tank on Oct. 28 Washington faced ""a period of deep strategic competition"" with China and it was vital to have a united approach at home to dispel the notion that America was in a ""hurtling decline.""

""We have to convince other countries we have our own house in order, which we do not right now,"" he said. ""Some degree of bipartisanship as we think about China and Asia is going to be essential ... Without it, we will, in all likelihood, fail.""

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2020 03:05PM ET</span>","Despite change at the White House, U.S. allies will remain wary after Trump","By Matt Spetalnick and Michelle Nichols
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Seated in front of photographers in the Oval Office in 2017, German Chancellor Angela Merkel leaned toward U.S. President Donald Trump during their first meeting: ""They want (us) to have a handshake."" But Trump ignored her and Merkel was unable to hide a look of incredulity as she turned to face the cameras.
Trump's treatment of traditional U.S. allies, on a personal and policy level, has left presumed President-elect Joe Biden with shell-shocked American friends likely forever wary of Washington's credibility - no matter who resides in the White House, say some diplomats and analysts. 
""The transatlantic relationship has never been this bad. The trust between the U.S. and Europe is not there anymore,"" said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""It can be repaired, but ... I'm not sure it will be the same.""
Biden, who was vice president under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, pledged before the Nov. 3 election to stand up for U.S. allies and ""make it clear to our adversaries the days of cozying up to dictators are over,"" referring to Trump's friendliness with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""You just can't reset to four years ago. In particular in both Europe and Asia, how we are smarter about rebuilding alliances to deal with the threats from China and Russia is going to be a major challenge for Biden,"" said Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama and now a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution think tank.
Biden has promised to hold a global ""Summit for Democracy"" to fight corruption, defend against authoritarianism, and advance human rights. Though there may have been a collective sense of relief among U.S. allies after his narrow election victory, he has acknowledged that ""picking up the pieces will be an enormous task"" after Trump. 
""Memories of Trump will remain and create a certain degree of background anxiety in what future U.S. presidents might do,"" said Michael O'Hanlon, of the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, describing it as an ""alliance PTSD."" 
U.S. friends and partners are also mindful that once Biden take office on Jan. 20, he is expected to focus heavily on twin domestic challenges of fighting the coronavirus pandemic and the U.S. economic crisis caused by it. 
LOST GUARDIAN
Trump championed an ""America First"" policy and while he said that didn't mean ""America alone"" there were several occasions where his administration was isolated, including on votes in the 15-member United Nations Security Council. 
The United States split with allies over Trump's decisions to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, leave the Iran nuclear deal, quit a global climate accord, challenge sexual and reproductive health and rights for women and leave the U.N. Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization.
Biden had vowed to rejoin the nuclear deal if Iran returns to compliance, return to the climate accord, abandon plans to leave the WHO and end a U.S. rule that bans funding of aid groups that discuss abortion.
""Now in Europe, leaders and people have realized that you conclude agreements with the U.S. and four years later, the following administration throws the agreements in the garbage,"" the senior European diplomat said. ""So there is a question of credibility and reliability of the U.S.""
A senior Trump administration official said it was unfair to conclude that the ""America First"" approach had hurt Washington's key alliances, insisting that Trump had just taken a tougher stance than Obama that had made relationships stronger and that most key allies had grown accustomed to his abrasive style.
A central issue for Trump has been NATO. He has pushed members, particularly Germany, to spend more and eroded faith in a pillar of post-war European security - that U.S. forces would defend members against any Russian aggression.
""Such points of contention do not explain why the U.S. administration has shown contempt for and sought to humiliate an erstwhile close ally,"" former German ambassador to Washington, Peter Wittig, wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine last month. ""The house of the West has lost its guardian."" 
Biden wrote in the same magazine earlier this year that his foreign policy would ""place the United States back at the head of the table"" because ""the world does not organize itself.""
'COMMON APPROACH'
The United States' northern neighbor and ally Canada, has also had a rocky relationship with Trump. Roland Paris, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former foreign policy adviser, said if Biden made an unequivocal commitment to NATO it would help salvage some of the bad feelings. 
""And in turning to allies to develop a more common approach to the challenges posed by China and Russia could also help to rebuild some of the trust that was lost during the Trump years,"" he told Reuters.
Biden has described U.S. commitment to NATO as ""sacred.""
In Asia, South Korea endured Trump questioning the value of their alliance and demanding Seoul pay more for U.S. troops stationed there. South Korean officials and analysts expect a change of tone, particularly on one of the world's top issues - North Korea. 
While Trump and North Korean leader Kim met three times, no progress was made toward Pyongyang giving up its nuclear weapons. In contrast, Biden has vowed ""a sustained, coordinated campaign with our allies and others, including China,"" a Pyongyang ally, to push for denuclearization. 
However, Biden can be expected to continue at least one of Trump's policies - an effort that in the past two months has secured agreements by three Arab states, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan, to start normalizing relations with U.S. ally Israel.
It is widely seen as one of Trump's few foreign policy successes, though Biden has made clear he will do more to restart talks between Israel and the Palestinians, who consider the moves by their Arab brethren a betrayal of their cause for statehood. 
Despite a new U.S. administration, Michael Kergin, a former Canadian ambassador to Washington, said traditional allies would remain wary of the United States.

""Publicly there will be a lot of positive things said,"" Kergin said. ""But from a strategic calculus, countries have already started to look around at alternatives and will weigh (matters) very carefully as they go forward in their relationship with the United States.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranians ""stood their ground bravely until that coward left"", Hesameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iran's president, tweeted on Saturday, shortly after Democrat Joe Biden captured the U.S. presidency on Saturday.
Relations between Iran and the United States have taken a turn for the worse since U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 pulled Washington out of Tehran's nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Tehran's economy. 
Iran's ambassador to Britain, Hamid Baeidinejad, tweeted: ""Finally, the political life of a man who only spreads hatred is over.""
The election of Biden could create an opportunity for new negotiations with Iran to resolve rows between the longtime foes, including Tehran’s nuclear programme, as sanctions pile economic pressure on its theocratic leaders. 
Iran has responded to Trump's ""maximum pressure"" policy by gradually scaling back its commitments under the nuclear agreement. 
Biden, vice president under President Barack Obama when Iran’s nuclear deal was reached, has pledged to rejoin the accord if Iran returns to compliance with it. 
Biden’s idea appears to be a return to the deal as a prelude to wider talks on Iran’s nuclear work, its ballistic missiles and regional activities. 
But Iran's leadership has ruled out halting its missile programme or changing its regional policy. Tehran demands a change in U.S. policy, including lifting sanctions and compensating Iran for the economic damages caused during the U.S. withdrawal from the accord. 
""Tehran sees Trump’s defeat as a vindication of its resistance policy. This will have devastating consequences for those who think diplomacy with Iran post-Trump will be cheap or easy,"" said Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at think-tank FDD in Washington. 
Hardliners close to Iran's top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei are concerned that easing pressure on Iran could offer their rival pragmatists a boost in the June presidential election, in which anti-U.S. security hawks are expected to win. 
But analysts said the country's battered economy, combined with coronavirus crisis, would force Iran's anti-U.S. hardliners to engage with Biden's administration despite their tightening grip on power.
""Iran will never normalise ties with the United States but the leadership will show 'heroic flexibility' in order to secure the survival of the Islamic Republic,"" said Tehran-based analyst Saeed Laylaz. 
Iran's troubled currency rose to a two-month high against the U.S. dollar on Saturday, helped by hopes of reduced U.S. sanctions under Biden.
""I am so happy. Biden's victory means less pressure on Iranians. He is like Obama. The hardship is over,"" university student Nima Sardari, 26, in Tehran told Reuters by telephone. 
But Iranian Shahrzad Nikou disagreed. ""Do not be so happy. Biden will not bring us democracy,"" she tweeted.

SAN CRISTOBAL VERAPAZ, Guatemala (Reuters) - Rescue workers on Saturday struggled over treacherous roads buried in mud and rubble to a remote mountain village in Guatemala swamped by a devastating storm that has killed dozens of people across Central America and southern Mexico.
Storm Eta's torrential downpours toppled trees, engorged swift-moving rivers, and ripped down parts of a mountainside above the village of Queja in the central Guatemalan region of Alta Verapaz, burying dozens of people in their homes.
The devastating weather front has spread destruction from Panama to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Mexico, which between them have registered well over 50 deaths.
A steady drizzle fell as firefighters in the town of San Cristobal Verapaz prepared to make the journey on foot to Queja, which they said could take a full day.
""An attempt was already made to get through but it's very difficult and we're really sad we couldn't get through, but it's very dangerous,"" said Juan Alberto Leal, an official with the local fire service. ""The problem is that there are several mudslides throughout the route.""
Ordinarily, the 22 kilometer (13.7 mile) trip between San Cristobal Verapaz and Queja takes an hour by car.
Still, some 55 soldiers, 25 firefighters and 15 police officers have managed to reach the site of the disaster.
President Alejandro Giammattei on Friday hinted up to 150 people could have been buried in the Queja landslide. 
Guatemalan disaster relief agency Conred said 116 people were still missing and 12 confirmed dead in the country.
It was not the first time disaster struck this corner of Alta Verapaz. The area around Queja appeared to be the site of a huge landslide on a road pass a decade ago, which killed dozens, army spokesman Ruben Tellez said.
One of the fiercest storms to hit Central America in years, Eta struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Tuesday with winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph).
Dumping relentless rains, it weakened to a tropical depression as it moved inland into Honduras and Guatemala before re-entering the Caribbean sea and advancing towards Cuba.

The Cuban meteorological office warned on Saturday of torrential rain and flooding as Eta churned northwards towards the island, and on track for Florida.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada allowed itself a moment of jubilation on Saturday after Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential election marked the end of four often bruising years with Donald Trump, but the new president's agenda means that challenges lie ahead.
""I look forward to working with President-elect Biden, Vice President-elect Harris, their administration, and the United States Congress as we tackle the world's greatest challenges together,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said shortly after several networks declared Biden the winner.
Trudeau was one of the first world leaders to Tweet his congratulations to the president-elect. 
Ottawa, traditionally a close U.S. ally, found itself pummeled by Trump, who called Trudeau ""very dishonest and weak,"" slapped tariffs on Canadian metals exports and threatened to scrap a continental trade deal that underpins Canada's economic prosperity.
Canada's ruling center-left Liberals have generally had good relations with Democratic administrations in recent decades, but Biden's principal policies could pose major problems for Canada and Trudeau.
""A Biden victory would mean smoother relations with the United States ... It would be more respectful and that alone would be an improvement,"" said Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Trudeau.
""Having said that, the United States has not only become more inward looking, but has also become more protectionist.""
Biden promises a ""Buy America"" push to spend $400 billion on U.S.-made goods. This could harm Canada since its economy is highly integrated with that of the United States, which takes 75% of all Canadian goods exports.
A similar U.S. provision in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis sparked a clash with Ottawa, forcing Canada to go through a lengthy process to secure waivers allowing its companies to take part in U.S. federal procurement contracts. Biden was vice-president in the Obama administration for eight years starting in January 2009.
""(Canada) has to appeal to America's self-interest ... and make the case that the less competitive your procurement is, probably the more costly it might be,"" said Mark Agnew, head of international policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
A mid-sized power devoted to multilateralism, Canada found itself isolated as Trump distanced himself from the United Nations, the World Health Organization, NATO and the World Trade Organization.
Canadian officials say they hope Biden will quickly start to repair the damage. In particular, Canada wants more U.S. cooperation as it bids to pressure China to change its policy on detaining foreigners.
In an incident Ottawa calls ""hostage diplomacy,"" Beijing arrested two Canadian men in 2018, shortly after Vancouver police detained Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.'s Chinese Chief Financial Officer on a U.S. warrant.
ENVIRONMENT
Biden has outlined a $2 trillion plan of environmental investments and other measures that ""would leave Canada basically in the dust,"" according to Keith Stewart, a climate and energy campaigner with Greenpeace Canada.
Canada, a major energy exporter with no chance of meeting its 2030 climate goals, may have to boost a price on carbon that is already unpopular in some parts of the country, and put more money into electric vehicles.
Biden is also looking at imposing a carbon adjustment tax on imports from nations deemed not to be doing enough to fight climate change.
""He is aiming for the moon with his green plan and we have to be along for the ride, we can't just go half way,"" said a Canadian government source, noting that the Democrats would first have to retake the Senate to implement the entire plan.
But Kergin, Paris and others predict Biden is likely to find his time dominated by domestic challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic and race relations.

""I think there's a danger in overestimating just how internationally focused a new Democratic administration would become,"" Gerry Butts, Trudeau's former chief adviser, told a Huffington Post Canada webcast.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",'Bye Trump': Asylum seekers stranded in Mexico celebrate Biden victory,"By Laura Gottesdiener
MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - The shiny silver balloons appeared in the squalid refugee camp in Mexican border city of Matamoros on Friday afternoon, as former vice president Joe Biden appeared poised for victory in the U.S. presidential election against incumbent Donald Trump.
""Bye Trump,"" the balloons read in all capital letters.
By Saturday morning, shouts of joy began to ring out in the camp where hundreds of asylum seekers have been stuck just across the river from Brownsville, Texas, under President Trump's hardline immigration policies.
""We're all going to celebrate today!"" said Dairon Elisondo, a Cuban asylum seeker who works as a doctor in the Matamoros camp. ""Everyone is so happy.""
Biden was declared victor of the U.S. presidential election by several major television networks on Saturday, even as Trump filed lawsuits, alleging fraud without providing evidence, and said the race was ""far from over.""
Under Trump, U.S. law has been progressively tightened to the point that it is now all but impossible to apply for asylum along the U.S. southern border.
It has been a tense week in the tent city, the largest of the makeshift encampments that sprung up in Mexican border towns after the Trump administration returned at least 66,000 asylum seekers to Mexico while their claims snaked through U.S. courts.
Dozens spent the election night singing hymns, praying for a Biden victory. Others posed outside their tents with ""Vote Biden-Harris"" signs, although they could not vote in the Nov.3 election that camp members said would determine their future.
The ensuing days brought fitful and sleepless nights to many, said Oscar Borjas, a Honduran asylum seeker, who recalled rising repeatedly throughout the night on Thursday to scour the internet for updates about the ballot count in Nevada.
The Matamoros camp, a sprawling and unsanitary makeshift encampment at the United States' doorstep, has become a symbol of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration. At its peak, it housed up to 3,000 asylum seekers.
Borjas estimates it now has about 800 left, after hundreds gave up waiting in the dangerous border city, where human rights groups have documented asylum seekers being kidnapped and extorted, and returned to their home countries.
REMAIN IN MEXICO?
Biden has promised to end the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, officially called Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP, although there are few details so far on how he will go about it.
Still, Borjas does not think the camp will be dismantled anytime soon. Even with Biden taking over, he estimates it could be at least another year until he and other asylum seekers could enter the United States while pursuing their claims, as was the pre-Trump administration policy.
""But it doesn't matter,"" he said. ""The main thing is that we can't return to our countries.""
Borjas said he fled Honduras after surviving threats and an assassination attempt linked to his political organizing against the ruling party. Reuters could not independently verify that.
The Trump administration has enacted a series of overlapping policies and restrictions that immigration experts say will be difficult for Biden to untangle.
But for now, asylum seekers are thrilled that the Trump era has seemingly come to an end.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Joe Biden presidency could reset ties with top U.S. trade partner Mexico that have suffered since Donald Trump made his first White House bid, tarring Mexican migrants as rapists and gun-runners and vowing to keep them out with a border wall.
Biden, vice president under Barack Obama, was declared victor of the U.S. presidential election by several major television networks on Saturday, despite President Trump filing lawsuits, alleging fraud without providing evidence and saying the race was ""far from over"".
A fixture of U.S. politics for half a century, Biden has pledged to stop construction of Trump's southwest border wall and pursue a ""humane"" migration policy far more in line with the one espoused by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Under Trump, Mexico has had to duck, feint and move quickly to navigate abrupt demands that it stem illegal migration or face having over $600 billion in annual bilateral trade upended.
Lopez Obrador has nimbly acceded to Trump's migration dictates, forging an uneasy relationship of some mutual convenience. In exchange, the Mexican leftist carved out space to change the rules on energy sector investment after the fact. 
Diplomats, politicians and foreign policy experts believe Biden would put brinkmanship and overt coercion behind him.
""There will be no more bullying. No more using the bully pulpit of the White House to harass Mexico either on the trade agenda or any of the other agendas,"" said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister for North America.
""We'll go back to a more normal relationship. With problems, and disputes on trade and other things,"" including security, he said. ""But they'll be dealt with the way they were in the past.""
The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's treatment of Mexico.
Despite Biden's conciliatory overtures on migration, Mexican officials acknowledge he will not want to face a sudden surge in migrants. So Mexico would maintain firm control of its southern border, they say.
Complicating matters, tensions have bubbled to the surface following the arrest last month of a former Mexican defense minister in Los Angeles on a warrant from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
Mexico has publicly expressed its displeasure about being kept in the dark about the operation to nab former army chief Salvador Cienfuegos on drug-trafficking charges, and Lopez Obrador this week said he wants to review U.S.-Mexico cooperation on counternarcotics policy.
""This is one of the most direct challenges to the strategic, forward-looking synergistic relationship that had been developing between Mexico and the United States,"" said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington.
The row has surfaced at a time when bilateral cooperation on security was already faltering after steady and substantial progress for two to three decades, Sarukhan said.
Still, it would be better managed under a Biden administration and would ""not contaminate the whole of the bilateral agenda, simply because of the hands-on experience that Biden has had in the U.S.-Mexico relationship,"" he added.
PRESSURE ON ENERGY POLICY
Biden also faces pressure to temper Lopez Obrador's drive to empower Mexican state-owned energy companies at the expense of private businesses, which has thrown billions of dollars of foreign investment into doubt.
More than 40 members of the U.S. Congress, both Republican and Democrat, on Oct. 22 wrote a letter to Trump urging him to take a firmer line with Lopez Obrador on his energy agenda.
Lopez Obrador argues corrupt past governments skewed the energy market in favor of profiteering private interests, both in oil production and in renewable energy generation - an area in which Biden has committed to creating millions of new jobs.
Both Mexican and U.S. business groups are hoping Biden urges Lopez Obrador to respect their contracts, with related litigation already threatening to create problems for Mexico.
At the same time, Biden is beholden to trade unions that want to enforce tougher new labor laws under the new Trump-crafted United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal that is meant to stem the outsourcing of jobs to Mexico.
That may yet dovetail with Lopez Obrador's priorities, as he has promised to strengthen the rights of workers and improve their pay, overseeing large increases in the minimum wage.
Lopez Obrador has said he would work with whoever won the election, though he upset some U.S. Democrats by making his only foreign visit as president to Trump at the White House in July, lavishing him with praise - footage of which quickly became part of the American's re-election campaign propaganda.
Lopez Obrador's chippiness toward media criticism and tendency to polarize the electorate has drawn comparisons with the U.S. president. One former Mexican official said Trump had referred in private to Lopez Obrador as ""Juan Trump.""
But those close to Lopez Obrador say the Mexican was always wary, viewing Trump as dangerously unpredictable and liable to turn on Mexico at any moment if it suited him.
Many officials in Mexico are privately looking forward to diplomatic business returning to more traditional, institutional pathways.
""No (U.S.) party is peaches and cream for Mexico,"" said Gabriela Cuevas, a congresswoman and foreign policy specialist in Lopez Obrador's governing National Regeneration Movement (MORENA). But Biden looks set to be far more committed to promoting a multilateral, environmental agenda than climate-skeptic Trump, which will benefit Mexico in the long-run, Cuevas said.

""It will be good to have someone much more concerned about what's going on in the planet at the head of a country as important as the United States,"" she said.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinea's top court on Saturday confirmed President Alpha Conde's victory in last month's election, rejecting accusations of fraud and handing him a third term his opponents say is unconstitutional. 
A campaign earlier this year by Conde, 82, to change the constitution in order to circumvent a two-term limit and subsequent candidacy in the Oct. 18 election sparked violent protests that resulted in the deaths of dozens of people. 
Cellou Dalein Diallo, a former prime minister and Conde's main rival, joined other opposition candidates in alleging irregularities in the official poll results that showed Conde with 59.5% of the vote. 
But constitutional court president Mohamed Lamine Bangoura said they had produced no evidence and declared Conde the winner.
Conde reacted by appealing to national unity. 
""I dedicate this victory to all Guineans, whether they voted for me or not. Beyond our differences, it's the Republic of Guinea that we need to put above our personal ambitions,"" Conde said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
Diallo condemned the court ruling but stopped short of calling for protests, as he has in the past. 
""The members of the high court of our country preferred to place themselves at the service of a man and his ambitions rather than respecting their oath and defending the law,"" he said in a statement. 
Conde's supporters celebrated in the streets of the capital Conakry, while police officers were deployed near Diallo's house to head off possible unrest.
In the opposition stronghold of Hamdallaye, in northwestern Guinea, security forces used tear gas to disperse Diallo supporters who had barricaded roads, a local resident said. 
Conde's actions have raised fears about a democratic backslide in Guinea, Africa's top bauxite producer, and West Africa more generally. 

Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of an election last month after running for a disputed third term.

Viasna, which is based in Minsk, said 60 doctors and other medical staff who had gathered for a rally were taken to police stations. 
Natalia Ganusevich, a spokeswoman for the Minsk police, confirmed that some of the demonstrators had been detained and called on the population not to take part in unauthorized protests, TASS news agency reported. 
At least 14 people were detained at a separate women's march on Saturday in the Belarusian capital, Viasna said. 
Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko is facing a weeks-long political crisis in which tens of thousands of Belarusians have regularly taken to the streets of Minsk calling for him to resign. 
Thousands of people have been arrested at demonstrations since a disputed Aug. 9 presidential election. Rights groups say hundreds of detainees reported being subjected to beatings and other abuse. 
The opposition has accused Lukashenko of rigging the election that granted him a sixth term.
A former collective farm manager in power since 1994, he has rejected that accusation and ignored the opposition's calls for him to step down. 
The 66-year-old has faced strong criticism from the medical community and general population for having resisted calls for strict lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
He publicly dismissed fears about COVID-19 as a ""psychosis"" and recommended remedies such as drinking vodka, taking saunas and playing ice hockey.

The former Soviet country of 9.5 million has so far reported 105,283 cases, with 1,004 deaths.

The two leaders expressed serious concern over the large-scale clashes between ethnic Armenian and Azeri forces in the region and the involvement of fighters from Syria and Libya in the conflict. 
Putin informed Macron of the steps Russia had taken towards implementing a ceasefire and ensuring the sides negotiate a solution to the crisis, the Kremlin said. 
The presidents also expressed their desire to continue coordinated mediation efforts, including through the OSCE Minsk Group, set up in 1992 to mediate a peaceful resolution.
At least 1,000 people and possibly many more have died in nearly six weeks of fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.

The conflict has underlined the influence of Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan, in a former Soviet region long dominated by Moscow, which has a defence pact with Armenia. It also threatens the security of Azeri oil and gas pipelines.

Lissu, who as head of leading opposition party CHADEMA was the main challenger to President John Magufuli in the Oct. 28 election, said that right after the vote he started getting death threats, and he entered the German residence on Monday. 
""I received two unknown calls whose callers told me they will deal with me once and for all,"" he told Reuters. 
""I had to move from my home last Sunday to a friend's home and then on Monday I went to the German (residence) seeking a temporary refuge for security reasons. Before entering the (residence), I was arrested and questioned temporarily before they released me,"" Lissu said.
""We are (now) waiting for the embassy to negotiate with the government for us to leave (to go) abroad. I cannot leave in a normal way without security assurance.""
In Berlin, a German official said Lissu had been at the German ambassador's residence. He had no further information for the time being.
Police said there were no threats against Lissu and were unaware of him seeking refuge, adding that he had been provided with police security in the run-up to the elections.
Lissu was shot 16 times and serious wounded in 2017 in what remains an unsolved case.
He and other opposition leaders including CHADEMA chairman Freeman Mbowe and ACT-Wazalendo party leader Zitto Kabwe were briefly arrested this week after calling for demonstrations to demand a re-run of the election, saying it was riddled with fraud. They also want a new independent electoral commission.
Police said the demonstrations were illegal and were meant to cause violence.
Magufuli, who was sworn in on Thursday for his final five-year term, has promised to work with his rivals.
He is praised by some for pushing through big-impact infrastructure projects and a sweeping anti-corruption campaign.
His critics accuse his government of intolerance and authoritarianism, including a crackdown on critical voices, closure of some media outlets and preventing opposition rallies.

""We agree that real democracy for Thailand will be the start of equality for Thai people and for rights to be prioritised again,"" said teacher Lalita Waisinittham, 26.
Protesters had initially demanded the removal of Prayuth, a former junta leader they accuse of engineering last year's election to keep power, but demonstrations have also broken taboos by calling for curbs on King Maha Vajiralongkorn's powers.
Prayuth says last year's election was fair and has refused to step down. The Palace has made no official comment on the protests, but last weekend the king said ""we love them all the same"" when asked to comment on the protesters.

Another anti-government demonstration is due on Sunday.

Sotoudeh's release followed warnings last month by human rights groups that her health had severely deteriorated after she staged a six-week hunger strike to demand the release of political prisoners and rights activists.
""Nasrin Sotoudeh... went on furlough with the agreement of the assistant superintendent of the women's prison,"" the judiciary's Mizan news agency said, without giving further details.

Sotoudeh, 57, who has represented opposition activists including women prosecuted for removing their mandatory head scarf, was arrested in 2018 and charged with spying, spreading propaganda and insulting Iran's supreme leader.
Sotoudeh, who denied the charges, was sentenced to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes. 
Just eight years earlier, she was jailed on similar propaganda charges and for conspiring to harm state security - charges she also denied - and was released after serving half her six-year term.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department sent Congress an informal notification of plans to sell $10 billion of defense equipment, including precision-guided munitions, non-precision bombs and missiles to the United Arab Emirates, a U.S. congressional aide said on Friday.
The informal notification about the ordnance, which was sent to lawmakers late on Thursday, came just after President Donald Trump's administration informed Congress it planned to sell sophisticated armed aerial drones to the UAE, news first reported by Reuters. 
The ordnance sale was first reported by CNN.
A State Department spokesman declined comment, saying its policy was not to confirm or comment on proposed defense sales until Congress is formally notified.
Both of the recent informal notifications came on the heels of last week's notification of a potential sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Middle East country.
Trump brokered a deal in September in which the UAE forged official ties with Israel. 
The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees - whose members have criticized UAE's role in civilian deaths in Yemen's civil war - review major weapons sales under an informal process before State sends its formal notification to the legislative branch.
Any deal the United States makes to sell weapons in the Middle East must satisfy decades of agreement with Israel that the U.S.-made equipment must not impair Israel's ""qualitative military edge,"" guaranteeing U.S. weapons furnished to Israel are ""superior in capability"" to those sold to its neighbors.

Eta could strengthen back into a tropical storm over the warm Caribbean waters before making landfall on the southern coast of central Cuba overnight, the office said, warning of coastal flooding and winds of 80-100 km per hour. 
Flooding could be a problem more broadly, it said, given Cuba was already waterlogged in the wake of heavy rains of late and Eta could potentially dump more than 300mm of water on central and mountainous regions.
""As the ground is already saturated, any additional rain could provoke inundations especially in mountainous areas and along the rivers,"" Cuba's best known meteorologist Jose Rubiera said on the Friday evening news broadcast on state-run TV.
The northwestern coast, including Havana's seafront, will probably flood moderately from Sunday to Tuesday, he said.
The government - well known for preparedness in the face of natural disasters - discussed measures on Friday to evacuate people, especially those living downstream from dams, and protect crops, homes and animals, according to state-run media. 
Given Eta's stormfront was uneven, there was the risk of torrential rain occurring across the entire country and Prime Minister Manuel Marrero warned against complacency in eastern or western regions.
The U.S. National Hurricane Centre (NHC) warned that flash and urban flooding would also be a possibility for the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, the Bahamas and southern Florida.
Tropical storm conditions were possible in the Florida Keys and south and central Florida from late Sunday, it said. 
One of the fiercest storms to hit Central America in years, Eta struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Tuesday with winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph) before weakening to a tropical depression as it moved inland and into neighboring Honduras and Belize.

Across swathes of the mostly poor countries wedged between Mexico and Colombia, high winds, torrential rains and catastrophic flooding caused deadly mudslides and damaged hundreds if not thousands of homes.

The United States on Friday blacklisted Bassil, leader of Lebanon's biggest Christian political bloc, accusing him of corruption and ties to the Iranian-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah movement that Washington deems a terrorist group.
Aoun asked Lebanon's caretaker foreign minister, Charbel Wehbe, to obtain evidence and documents that should be submitted to Lebanon's judiciary ""to take the necessary legal measures"", the presidency tweeted.
In September, Aoun issued similar directives after Washington blacklisted two former government ministers over accusations of aiding Hezbollah.
Bassil, who harbours presidential ambitions, heads the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) founded by Aoun and has served as minister of telecoms, of energy and water and of foreign affairs. 
""Sanctions have not scared me nor promises tempted me,"" Bassil said in a Twitter post following the announcement.
The FPM has a political alliance with Hezbollah, which has become Lebanon's most powerful political force. Bassil has defended the group as vital to the defence of Lebanon.
Hezbollah condemned the sanctions as blatant interference aimed at forcing U.S. ""dictates"" on Lebanon.
The sanctions could complicate efforts by Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri to navigate Lebanon's sectarian politics and assemble a cabinet to tackle a financial meltdown, the country's worst crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war and which is rooted in endemic corruption, waste and mismanagement.
The U.S. Treasury Department accused Bassil of being at the ""forefront of corruption in Lebanon"". A senior U.S. official said Bassil's support for the armed group Hezbollah was ""every bit of the motivation"" for targeting him for sanctions.

Bassil was sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets human rights abuses and corruption around the world.

Ivorian prosecutors are pursuing terrorism charges against more than a dozen opposition leaders who boycotted the Oct. 31 vote in which Ouattara won a third term in office and announced they were creating a transitional council.
The standoff has raised fears of protracted instability in the world's top cocoa producer, whose disputed 2010 presidential election led to a brief civil war. More than 40 people have died in clashes before and since the latest vote. 
Affi was arrested overnight after the public prosecutor confirmed on Friday that he was being sought by the police, his wife, Angeline Kili, told Reuters. 
""I confirm that my husband was arrested during the night but I don't know where he is right now,"" she said. 
Genevieve Goetzinger, a spokeswoman for Affi, said on Twitter he was arrested in the southeastern town of Akoupe while en route to his hometown of Bongouanou. 
The police were not immediately available for comment. 
Affi served as prime minister from 2000-2003 under President Laurent Gbagbo, whose refusal to concede defeat to Ouattara after the 2010 election sparked a civil war which killed 3,000 people.
The opposition claims Ouattara has violated the constitution by seeking a third term. Ouattara says approval of a new constitution in 2016 restarted his mandate and allowed him to run again.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian jets bombed the Tigray region on Friday and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed pledged more air strikes in the escalating conflict amid reports that Tigrayan forces had seized control of federal military sites and weapons.
Civilians in the northern region should avoid ""collateral damage"" by not gathering outside as strikes would continue, Abiy said in a televised speech on Friday evening, defying international pleas for both sides to show restraint. 
The developments illustrate how quickly the days-old conflict is escalating, raising the threat of a civil war that experts and diplomats warn would destabilise the country of 110 million people and hurt the broader Horn of Africa.
A simmering row between Abiy's federal government and his former Tigrayan allies exploded on Wednesday after Abiy ordered a military campaign. Abiy, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, accused the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), of attacking a federal military base and trying to steal equipment. He said ""the last red line"" had been crossed.
In a step to further deny legitimacy to Tigray's regional government elected in September against the federal government's advise, Ethiopia's federal parliament on Saturday approved the formation of an interim government for the region.
""A decision has been passed to remove the current executive body and council of (Tigray) region,"" Ethiopia's House of Federation said in a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
The government cut phone and internet communications to the region, according to the digital rights group Access Now, making it impossible to verify official accounts. The government accused the TPLF of shutting down communications.
Diplomats, regional security officers and aid workers have told Reuters that fighting is spreading in the northwestern part of the country, along Tigray's border with the Amhara region, which is backing the federal government, and near the border with Sudan and Eritrea. 
Abiy said on Friday that government troops had seized control of the town of Dansha, near the border area, from the TPLF.
RISKS
After toppling a Marxist dictator in 1991, the TPLF led the country's multi-ethnic ruling coalition until Abiy took office in 2018. For those decades, Tigrayans dominated the military.
Abiy, who is from the Oromo ethnic group, Ethiopia's largest, has sacked many senior generals as part of a crackdown on past rights abuses and corruption which Tigrayans complain unfairly targets them.
Tigrayan forces are battle-hardened and possess significant stocks of military hardware, experts say. Their regional troops and associated militias number up to 250,000 men, according to the International Crisis Group think tank.
One of the biggest risks is that the Ethiopian army will splinter along ethnic lines, with Tigrayans defecting to the regional force. There are indications that is already happening, experts said. 
Tigrayan forces were in control of the federal military's Northern Command headquarters in the city of Mekelle, according to a United Nations internal security report dated Friday and seen by Reuters. 
The Northern Command is one of Ethiopia's four military commands and controls the border with Sudan, Djibouti and Eritrea. 
Tigrayan forces have seized ""heavy weapons"" from several of the command's depots, the report read. 
It said that the command is the most heavily armed and contains ""most of the military’s heavy weapons including the majority of the country’s mechanised and armoured units, artillery and air assets.""
The government is mobilising troops from around the country and sending them to Tigray, risking a security vacuum in other parts of the country where ethnic violence is raging. 
More than 50 people were killed by gunmen from a rival ethnic group in western Ethiopia on Sunday, according to Amnesty International.

Troop redeployments from near the border with Somalia will make that area ""more vulnerable to possible incursions by Al Shabaab,"" the al Qaeda-linked insurgency trying to overthrow the government in Somalia, according to the U.N. internal security report.

GUATEMALA CITY/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The death toll from torrential downpours unleashed by storm Eta leapt on Friday as Guatemalan soldiers reached a mountain village where around 100 people were killed by a landslide, adding to dozens of other dead in Central America and Mexico.
Many of those who lost their lives in the village of Queja in the central Guatemalan region of Alta Verapaz were buried in their homes after mudslides swallowed around 150 houses, army spokesman Ruben Tellez said.
The devastating weather front brought destruction from Panama to Honduras and Mexico, which between them have registered more than 50 flood-related deaths.
Tellez said it was not the first time disaster had struck the remote corner of Alta Verapaz. The area around Queja appeared to be the site of a huge landslide on a road pass a decade ago, which killed dozens, he said.
""Now with all this phenomenon it collapsed again,"" he added.
Photos of the Queja landslide showed a lengthy strip of brown mud peeled from the lush green hillside. A video shared by the army showed soldiers trying to get to Queja having to haul themselves through a morass of mud with the aid of a guide rope.
The army said about 100 people are believed to have died in Queja alone, though searches for survivors continue.
Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei hinted the death toll could be higher, with the number of dead and missing in Queja estimated at about 150.
Footage from another part of Guatemala showed boats ferrying villagers in flooded regions and rescue workers carrying children on their backs, wading through water up to their hips. 
'CATASTROPHIC FLOODING'
One of the fiercest storms to hit Central America in years, Eta on Friday dumped more torrential rain across swaths of Central America. The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned ""catastrophic flooding"" in the region would continue.
Rescue operations across Honduras and Guatemala have been slowed by destroyed roads and bridges, forcing authorities to bring in the military and use helicopters and speedboats to rescue people stranded on top of their houses.
""This is the worst storm Honduras has seen in decades. The damage will undoubtedly be significant,"" said Mark Connolly, UNICEF representative in Honduras, who estimated about 1.5 million children there will be affected.
Across the border from Guatemala in the Mexican state of Chiapas, flooding has killed 19 people, many swept up by rivers whose banks burst, state authorities said.
North of Chiapas in Tabasco state, the deluges killed two more people, the federal government said. 
In Honduras, flooding has killed 23 people and two are missing, the government said. Many remained trapped on their roofs, the National Risk Management System said.
""We have been without food for two days ... waiting to be evacuated,"" William Santos, sheltering on top of a banana packing plant with about 300 people in northern Honduras, told Reuters.
Eta hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Tuesday blowing furious winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph). It weakened to a tropical depression inland but the rain continued.
Bad weather is hampering rescue efforts.
""We have a lot of people trapped we have not been able to reach,"" said Guatemalan President Giammattei.
The devastation harked back to Hurricane Mitch, which killed some 10,000 people in Central America in 1998.
REGIONAL IMPACT
The high winds and heavy rain have damaged thousands of homes in Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, whose government has not yet detailed the human cost of the storm.
Two miners were reported killed in Nicaragua, while in southern Costa Rica a landslide killed a Costa Rican woman and an American man in a house. Eight others, including at least three children, died in flooding near the Costa Rican border in Panama's Chiriqui province, authorities said.
In Honduras, about 16,000 people have been rescued in the northern Valle Sula region, authorities said. Over 5,000 people were evacuated in Guatemala, officials said.
On Friday evening, Eta was off Belize's coast in the Caribbean, churning towards Cuba and Florida, the NHC said.
But remnants of the weather system will continue to hammer parts of Central America with flooding, it added.

Flash flooding was also possible across Jamaica, southeast Mexico, the Cayman Islands and Cuba.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>","In Evo's shadow, Bolivia's new president Luis Arce promises moderate socialism","By Marcelo Rochabrun and Daniel Ramos
LA PAZ (Reuters) - Luis Arce, a quiet economist who will be sworn in as Bolivia's president on Sunday after a landslide election win, knew where he stood in the political spectrum as a young teenager in La Paz, when he picked up the writings of philosopher Karl Marx.
Arce steered the Andean country's economy for over a decade under former leader Evo Morales, an ebullient leftist who resigned last year after an election dogged by disputed claims of fraud sparked widespread protests. Arce was often seen as a moderating influence to more radical elements in Morales' Movement towards Socialism (MAS) party.
Arce, 57, will be inaugurated to the top job on Sunday amid bubbling political tensions that remain in the country and the impending return of Morales, who plans to cross back into the country early next week after living in exile in Argentina. 'Evo' still casts a long shadow over the country and sharply divides opinion. 
On Friday Arce took part in an Andean ancestral ceremony. The influence and power of Bolivia's large but previously marginalized indigenous population grew under Morales, an Aymara who was the country's first indigenous leader. 
Political leaders including Argentina's Peronist President Alberto Fernandez, Paraguay's Mario Abdo, Iranian leader Hassan Rouhani, Spain's King Felipe, and Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodríguez are expected to attend Sunday's ceremony.
""I have had my ideas since I was 14 years old and I started reading Karl Marx. Since then I have not stopped having the same ideological position and I am not going to change for anything,"" Arce told Reuters in an interview in October.
Arce is credited by supporters as the architect of Bolivia's growth ""miracle"" in the 2000s that lifted many out of poverty in one of South America's most impoverished nations.
As economy minister, he pushed for the nationalization of many sectors, stoking ire among investors, but - helped in part by the commodities boom - steered Bolivia to an average annual growth rate of 4.6%, one of the best in Latin America.
Arce crafted the economic plan for Morales' successful 2005 presidential run, which launched a near 14-year administration that sputtered towards the end as growth slowed and opposition grew to Morales seeking an unprecedented fourth term.
Unlike Morales, a former union head for coca farmers who became an almost cult figure, Arce grew up in a middle-class La Paz household and is known for being softly spoken and keeping a low personal profile.
He studied economics at Bolivia's prestigious Universidad Mayor de San Andrés, and then at the University of Warwick in England.
""He is not really a 'strong man' sort of character,"" said Franklin Pareja, a Bolivian political analyst in La Paz. ""He is a person who comes from the academy, from the middle class, he's a technocrat and not a social warrior or a union leader."" 
That could help Arce heal angry divisions in the country. Many criticize Morales for trying to hold onto power and running in defiance of term limits, though he also retains a strong core of support.
Arce has taken steps to distance himself from Morales, telling Reuters the former president would have ""no role"" in his administration beyond his influence as leader of the party. 
At the party headquarters there was little reference to Morales in pamphlets and posters on the walls when Reuters visited, though his planned return raises the question of whether he will be content to watch from the sidelines.
The country Arce inherits is markedly different from the boom years, with the coronavirus pandemic set to result in a 6% economic contraction this year, World Bank forecasts show. Even under Morales, gas exports and foreign reserves had started to dwindle.
Arce has promised not to cut public spending, though he also acknowledges that some austerity measures will be needed.
But he remains confident that the Bolivian miracle is not over. 

""I think our model has shown the world that there is a different way to do things, and do them successfully,"" he said.

The International Civil Aviation Organization said members of its 36-nation council issued the call, nearly 10 months after a Ukraine International Airlines flight was shot down by an Iranian ground-to-air missile, killing 176 people.
""We have had several exchanges with the Iranian CAA in which we urged its authorities to expedite the accident investigation,"" council president Salvatore Sciacchitano told a meeting of the committee, according to ICAO.
Iran's representative to ICAO, however, said he had made a full report to the council on the progress of the investigation.
A draft of the final report has been completed and is being translated, Farhad Parvaresh told Reuters.
It will be sent to participating nations in ""a couple of weeks,"" he said, adding that Iran was adhering to international rules on air investigations known as Annex 13.
Those rules include a recommendation that the final report appears within 12 months, which in this case runs until early January, though many high-profile probes take longer.
Although the deadline has not yet been reached, some states including Canada are concerned about what they view as a lack of transparency, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guard has said it accidentally shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 on Jan. 8, mistaking it for a missile at a time when tensions were high between Iran and the United States.
Canada and families of the victims are pressing Iran for additional answers following an initial report on the contents of black boxes, which were sent to France for analysis in July. 
Many of the 176 victims killed in the crash were Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
Ukraine, where the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 was operated, and the United States, where it was designed and built, are automatically part of any formal accident investigation under ICAO rules.

The rules say any participating nations should be given 60 days to make comments before the final report can be published.

It was the first killing of a protester by security forces in Basra since Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office in May. 
Iraq's interior ministry confirmed the death but said in a statement that no Iraqi security forces were being allowed to use weapons against demonstrators and that it was investigating the incident.
Deadly flare-ups have been rare since protests against Iraq's ruling elite and demanding jobs and services largely subsided earlier this year.
During months of anti-government protests that erupted under his predecessor Adel Abdul Mahdi in October 2019, more than 500 people were killed, mostly young unarmed demonstrators.
The Basra security sources and rights official said several dozen protesters had taken to the streets in the country's southern oil hub on Friday demanding jobs and basic services.
They were angry that Kadhimi had generally failed to deliver on both and that protest camps had been cleared by security force in Basra and Baghdad, the rights official said.
Kadhimi, who visited Basra on Thursday to tour energy projects and meet provincial officials, has pledged to protect non-violent Iraqi protesters and bring justice for the families of those killed last year by security forces and unidentified gunmen.

Security forces in Baghdad last month were ordered not to use live fire in dealing with protests to mark the anniversary of the 2019 demonstrations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on Friday on Gebran Bassil, the leader of Lebanon's biggest Christian political bloc and son-in-law of President Michel Aoun, accusing him of corruption and ties to Hezbollah.
Bassil heads the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), founded by Aoun, and has served as minister of telecoms, of energy and water and of foreign affairs.
The target of protests that erupted last year against a political class accused of pillaging the state, Bassil said in a Twitter post that sanctions did not scare him and that he had not been ""tempted"" by promises.
The sanctions could complicate efforts by Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri to navigate Lebanon's sectarian politics and assemble a cabinet to tackle a financial meltdown, the country's worst crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war.
A source familiar with the process said the move was likely to harden the FPM's stance in negotiations on a new government needed to enact reforms demanded by foreign donors to tackle endemic corruption, waste and mismanagement to unlock aid.
In recent months, the United States has also placed sanctions on several officials linked to Hezbollah, the armed Iran-backed Shi'ite movement that has become Lebanon's most powerful political force, and which Washington considers a terrorist group.
Hezbollah condemned the U.S. move as purely political and ""a blatant and gross interference."" 
""This decision specifically aims to force a big Lebanese political team to submit to American conditions and dictates on Lebanon,"" it said in a statement.
The FPM has a political alliance with Hezbollah and Bassil has defended the group as vital to the defense of Lebanon.
The Treasury Department said Bassil was at the ""forefront of corruption in Lebanon"" where successive governments have failed to reduce mounting sovereign debt or address failing infrastructure and the loss-making power sector that cost state coffers billions of dollars while power cuts persisted. 
""Through his corrupt activities, Bassil has also undermined good governance and contributed to the prevailing system of corruption and political patronage that plagues Lebanon, which has aided and abetted Hizballah’s (Hezbollah) destabilizing activities,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. 
A senior U.S. official said Bassil's support for Hezbollah was ""every bit of the motivation"" for targeting him for sanctions.
Bassil was sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets human rights abuses and corruption around the world. It calls for a freeze on any U.S. assets and prohibits Americans from doing business with him.
The State Department also imposed a ban on Bassil's travel to the United States. 

A senior U.S. official said the sanctions announcement was ""not intended to impact a government formation process"" in Lebanon. The official also denied any connection between the announcement and this week's U.S. elections, saying such sanctions packages take months to prepare.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's air force bombed arms depots and destroyed military hardware in the northern Tigray region on Friday, the prime minister said, escalating a war he launched this week against his former ruling coalition allies.
The air strikes in and around the regional capital Mekelle wiped out rocket launchers and other weaponry belonging to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said in a statement he read on national television.
Hours earlier, Abiy - who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize - justified his decision to start military action in Tigray by saying it was necessary to disarm the TPLF. The campaign had ""clear, limited and achievable objectives"", he said.
The government is mobilising troops from around the country and sending them to Tigray after two days of clashes between federal forces and the TPLF, Ethiopia's dominant political force for decades until Abiy took office in 2018. 
Abiy has called retired generals back to duty in hopes of preventing the military from fragmenting along ethnic lines, a diplomat and a regional security expert told Reuters.
The military operations seek ""to restore the rule of law and the constitutional order, and to safeguard the rights of Ethiopians to lead a peaceful life wherever they are in the country,"" Abiy said.
TPLF officials were not immediately available for comment. The government cut phone and internet communications in the region on Wednesday.
In a statement, Abiy's office accused TPLF leaders of hiding in the regional capital Mekelle and ""using the civilian population as human shields"".
""Members of the TPLF, who ruled the country for the previous 27 years through means of oppression rather than law, have been fugitives from justice,"" it said.
NOBEL PRIZE, ETHNIC VIOLENCE
Abiy took office pledging to open up one of the most restrictive political systems in Africa, and won the Nobel Prize for ending a conflict with neighbouring Eritrea. But ethnic violence has exploded in many parts of the country on his watch, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes.
Tensions between the federal government and the TPLF have been building for months. The TPLF led a guerrilla movement that came to power in a revolution in 1991, and established a multi-ethnic coalition that was dominated by Tigrayans for decades.
Tigrayans have complained of persecution under Abiy, an ethnic Oromo, who ordered the arrest of dozens of former senior military and political officials from the TPLF in a crackdown on corruption. Last year, Abiy reorganised the ruling coalition into a single party which the TPLF refused to join.
Diplomats tried to push the sides towards negotiations this week to prevent a civil war.
""The stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region. I call for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and a peaceful resolution to the dispute,"" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a message on Twitter late on Thursday.
Sporadic sounds of shelling were heard from Abdurafi town, near the border between Tigray and the neighbouring Amhara region, at 3 a.m local time (0000 GMT) on Friday, a humanitarian worker in the area told Reuters. 
Tigray hosts Ethiopia’s largest military base and more than half of the army’s troops. The Tigray regional administration said this week that it had taken over assets of the national defence force's northern command based in Tigray. Two diplomats and a regional military officer said the claim was credible.
The conflict ""could test the national military's cohesion,"" the International Crisis Group think tank said in a statement. 

Federal troops are being helped by local forces from Amhara, its regional president, said in a statement on Thursday. Amhara borders Tigray and the regions are locked in a boundary dispute.

LONDON (Reuters) - New COVID-19 infections in England have stabilized at around 50,000 a day, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday, indicating a levelling-off in the steep rise of cases even before England was pushed into a second national lockdown.
The ONS said there were an estimated 45,700 new cases per day in the week to Oct 31, down slightly from the previous week's estimate of 51,900.
""Incidence appears to have stabilized at around 50,000 new infections per day,"" the ONS said in its weekly infection survey. ""The infection rate has increased in recent weeks, but the rate of increase is less steep compared with previous weeks."" 
An estimated 618,700 people had the disease during the most recent week, up from 568,100 the previous week.
That equates to an estimated 1 in 90 people, an increase in prevalence from 1 in 100 people the week before.
The ONS looks to estimate infection numbers in the community beyond those who have been tested, giving an estimate of prevalence that is unaffected by testing capacity, and the latest data was from before the new national lockdown came in on Thursday.
Experts said the infection survey was evidence the pandemic was slowing or even in decline, but that more data was needed to confirm the trend.
The overall number of infections could mean the test and trace system, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has conceded has not had the desired impact on the pandemic, may still struggle to function.
""While this is clearly welcome... this is still a very high number of new cases each day – far higher than can be expected to be managed effectively by the current test and trace program,"" said Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard of Imperial College London's School of Public Health.
Among those who have been tested, Britain reported 23,287 new daily cases of COVID-19 and 355 deaths, and the 7-day average toll is for over 300 deaths a day.
Government scientists said the reproduction ""R"" number was unchanged at between 1.1-1.3, and that they were confident that the epidemic had continued to grow in recent weeks.
""Although there is some evidence that the rate of growth in some parts of the country may be slowing, levels of disease are very high in these areas,"" the Government Office for Science said.

Hundreds of thousands of Muslims from countries including Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan and Bangladesh live in Athens but the city has not had a formal mosque since it forced occupying Ottomans to leave nearly 200 years ago.
Plans to build a mosque in Athens began in 1890 but it took decades for them to materialise due to opposition from a predominantly Christian Orthodox population and nationalists, sluggish bureaucracy but most recently a decade-long financial crisis.
Amid a coronavirus outbreak, only a limited number of worshippers, wearing masks and sitting at a distance from each other due to COVID-19 restrictions, attended prayers.
""It is a historic moment for the Muslim community living in Athens, we have been waiting for this mosque for so long,"" said Heider Ashir, a member of the mosque's governing council. ""Thanks to God, finally, we have a mosque which is open and we can pray here freely.""
But other Muslims were unhappy with the mosque's appearance. A grey, rectangular structure with no dome or minaret, has no resemblance to other graceful, ornate mosques in Europe.
""It does not at all look like a place of worship, it is a small, square, miserable building,"" said Naim El Ghandour, head of the Muslim Association of Greece. ""We thank them very much for the offer, but we will fight to reach it to the level that we deserve."" 
Under a lockdown to curb a surge in COVID infections, gatherings for formal worshipping will be banned from Saturday until Nov. 30. 

""We will pray at home, and as soon as the lockdown is over the mosque will again be open for the worshippers,"" Ashir said.

There was no immediate comment from Israeli authorities on whether they had offered any special assurances to Maher Al-Akhras, 49, who has been in an Israeli hospital suffering from heart pain and convulsions, according to his wife.
Akhras, a resident of the city of Jenin in the north of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was taken into custody in July under an Israeli ""administrative detention"" order.
Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency says Akhras was detained after it received information that he was an operative of the Islamic Jihad militant group, an allegation his wife has denied.
He had vowed to continue to refuse solid food despite an October decision by Israel's Supreme Court not to extend his detention beyond Nov. 26.
But after receiving what it called ""a firm commitment (by Israel) not to renew his administrative detention ... Maher Al-Akhras decided to end his hunger strike starting today, Friday Nov. 6,"" the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which works on behalf of prisoners, said in a statement. 
""He will spend the remaining period until his release receiving treatment in the hospital,"" the statement added. 
The Israel Prison Service referred questions to the Israeli military, which did not immediately provide comment. 

There are around 5,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails, 350 of them under administrative detention, Palestinian officials said. Israeli officials say detention without trial is sometimes necessary to protect the identities of undercover operatives.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday denounced what he called intolerable threats to freedom of expression, after a Rotterdam teacher was forced into hiding following a classroom discussion on the killing of French teacher Samuel Paty.
Police said they had arrested a teenager on suspicion of inciting threats against the Dutch teacher.
It was not clear if the unidentified 18-year-old woman, who police said posted messages on social media, was a student at the city's Emmauscollege high school, where the class debate took place. 
Police did not detail the content of the messages.
Premier Mark Rutte called threats against the teacher ""absurd"" and ""intolerable"".
""We must be able to discuss topics such as freedom of expression in our classrooms without any outside pressure,"" he told reporters. 
""It may hurt when someone has an opinion that conflicts with your worldview or religious conviction, but they have a right to say so in all liberty.""
Schools in the Netherlands, France and Germany had been asked to hold a moment of silence for Paty, who was beheaded by a man of Chechen origin in a Paris suburb in October after showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
During a classroom discussion on Monday at the Emmauscollege, students noticed a satirical cartoon that had been hanging on a bulletin board for years, and some took offence.
The cartoon, which won a national prize in 2015, shows a decapitated figure labelled ""Charlie Hebdo"" sticking its tongue out at a bearded man with a bloody sword. 
A photo of the image quickly began circulating on social media, and on Tuesday the teacher who had led the discussion went into hiding due to what police said were serious threats. 

Also on Tuesday, Le Monde reported that a school in a Paris suburb was closed after threats against a teacher.

The head of the main domestic intelligence agency for the city of Vienna, the Vienna Provincial Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (LVT) was stepping down temporarily while an investigation was carried out, Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told a news conference.
""Obvious and from our point of view intolerable mistakes were made,"" Nehammer said. 
Austria had already admitted fumbling intelligence from Slovakia that the 20-year-old gunman, who was shot dead by police during his rampage in the centre of the capital, had attempted to buy ammunition there.
""People in Germany who were being monitored by German intelligence stayed in Austria in the summer and also met the attacker here,"" Vienna police chief Gerhard Puerstl said.
""These facts together with the findings that emerged from the information from Slovakia could have led to a different outcome regarding the assessment of the threat posed by the perpetrator,"" he added.
Nehammer said all such threat assessments would be reviewed to ensure the right monitoring measures are in place.
Austria also ordered the closure of two mosques in Vienna, one of which was technically an association, that the attacker visited frequently and which had contributed to his radicalisation, Integration Minister Susanne Raab said.
Austria arrested 15 people in connection with the attack. A Vienna court ordered eight of them aged 16-24 remanded in custody, it said on Friday.
""They are strongly suspected of having contributed to the crimes of murder, belonging to a terrorist organisation and a criminal organisation by supporting the attacker in the run-up to the attack,"" the court said, adding that its ruling was initially valid until Nov. 20.
Police in Germany on Friday searched homes and businesses linked to four people believed to have had ties to the shooter, whom Austrian authorities have described as an Islamist terrorist.

Switzerland has also arrested two men who the authorities there said knew the attacker.

POLGARDI, Hungary (Reuters) - The wedding of Hungarian transgender couple Tamara Csillag and Elvira Angyal looked just like any other, with the nervous pair dressing up and heading off to the rural Hungarian court room where their marriage would be sealed.
But in the world of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, this was special as Orban, increasingly hostile to LGBT+ people, has outlawed legal recognition of transgender identity.
Ironically, that made the wedding possible, as Csillag was stuck with male documents while Angyal had already completed her transition and had the documents to prove it.
""Our dream has come true. We are so happy to have received an official seal on our relationship,"" Angyal said after the ceremony, holding hands with her new wife.
She kissed her and said: ""I love you."" 
""I love you back,"" Csillag said.
Theirs was far from a smooth journey. Both had families as men before coming out to live as women. Of seven children between them, only one, Angyal's son Patrik, was present.
""One of the biggest joys in life is to see your parents happy,"" Patrik said.
Rights groups say Orban and his political allies, the small Christian Democratic party KDNP, have targeted the gay community since he won a third term in 2018.
""For a decade the government has waged a systematic campaign against LMBTQ people,"" said Luca Dudits of the Hatter rights group. ""This contradicts European norms and general human rights.""
The wedding came one day after Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjen renewed homophobic attacks with a proposal to enshrine in the country's constitution a ban on ""gender propaganda"".
""They should not be called family, because that is a sacred notion,"" Semjen said. ""They should not adopt children, because children's right to healthy development is stronger than homosexual couples' need for a child.""
Csillag said she was confident enough for such legal moves and propaganda not to shake her.
""What harms children is what the government does,"" she said. ""The next generation might indeed grow up haters. They will hate us even as they won't know why.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican said on Friday that its long-awaited report into disgraced ex-U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick will be released on Tuesday.
Vatican sources told Reuters on Thursday that the report was imminent and would be released before the start of the annual meeting of American bishops Nov. 16-17
Pope Francis expelled McCarrick from the Roman Catholic priesthood last year after a Vatican investigation found him guilty of sexual crimes against minors and adults and abuse of power.
The report, which is several hundred pages long, is expected to show how McCarrick managed to rise through the ranks even though his history of sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians was an open secret.
In 2018, the pope ordered a thorough study of all documents in Holy See offices concerning McCarrick. The four U.S. dioceses where he served - New York, Metuchen, Newark, and Washington, D.C. - carried out separate investigations to feed into the Vatican report.
Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said on his website that the report ""could be another black-eye for the Church ... but better that the story come out, in all its awful detail.""

Dolan, whose archdiocesan review board in 2018 was the first to find that allegations against McCarrick were ""credible and substantiated,"" said he hoped the report will ""bring some measure of peace to the victim-survivors, as well as serve as a lesson on how to prevent a similar recurrence in the future"".

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.S. mission in Geneva urged World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday to invite Taiwan to a major meeting the body is hosting next week expected to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We encourage the WHO to expand its efforts to offer Taiwan increased meaningful cooperation and collaboration with the organization, and this (an invitation to participate) would be a needed step in that direction,"" it said in a statement.
Washington has been deeply critical of the WHO and its boss Tedros for its handling of the pandemic, saying it is too close to China, and plans to withdraw.
Backed by the United States, Taiwan has stepped up lobbying this year to take part in the meeting of the WHO's decision-making body as an observer, angering China, which claims the democratically-run island as its own territory.
Taiwan, which was praised internationally for quickly containing the coronavirus, was not invited to an earlier meeting by the same body in May and it agreed to put off the issue until later in the year. Western diplomats say it is unlikely to change now. 
Asked about next week's meeting of the World Health Assembly at a Friday news briefing, the WHO's Principal Legal Officer Steven Solomon said: ""Taiwanese involvement at the WHA as an observer continues to be a question for member states"". The body has previously said it has no mandate to invite Taiwan since members disagree on the island's participation.
The virtual meeting of 194 member states is set to focus on COVID-19 and related health issues. The WHO cooperates with Taiwan on various health matters including on aspects of the pandemic.

""There has been an active, really wonderful exchange with colleagues and scientists from Taiwan's CDC and others,"" said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO technical lead for COVID-19, calling scientific collaboration with them ""really great"".

WARSAW (Reuters) - The Vatican has disciplined an elderly Polish cardinal who was accused of sexually abusing a minor, the latest of several clerics to be caught up in a widening scandal in the homeland of the late Pope John Paul II.
The Vatican's nunciature (embassy) in Poland said Cardinal Henryk Gulbinowicz, 97, the former archbishop of Wroclaw, was disciplined after an investigation of ""allegations regarding the cardinal's past"".
It gave no details but last year the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper published an article by a man who accused Gulbinowicz of sexually abusing him when he was a minor in the 1990s and a student in a Catholic seminary.
The case was brought to prosecutors but they could not proceed because of the statue of limitations. At the time, the cardinal's lawyer said the accusations were false and the lawyer declined to comment on Friday when contacted by Reuters.
Church authorities in Wroclaw, where Gulbinowicz served as archbishop in 1976-2004, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from him.
Father Rafal Kowalski, a spokesman for the Wroclaw archdiocese, told broadcaster TVN24: ""We have to say we're sorry. There is an intention to clear up these issues and judge, so people who have hurt others are punished."".
On Thursday, Vatican ordered an investigation into the former archbishop of Gdansk on suspicion of negligence over sex abuse allegations, and last month the pope accepted the resignation of a Polish bishop accused of shielding sexually abusive priests.

The nunciature said Gulbinowicz would be banned from practicing his ministry in public, would have to contribute to a fund to help victims of sexual abuse and would be denied burial in what was once his cathedral, a tradition in Catholic countries.

The ex-monarch, who left Spain for the United Arab Emirates amid a cloud of scandal in August, was already under a separate preliminary supreme court investigation linked to a high-speed train contract in Saudi Arabia.
The prosecutor's office gave no further detail on Friday. 
Spokespersons for the Royal House and for King Juan Carlos could not be reached for comment.
On Tuesday, the prosecutor's office had announced yet another line of investigation into Juan Carlos, without giving any details. 
Juan Carlos came to the throne in 1975 after the death of General Francisco Franco and was widely respected for his role in helping guide Spain from dictatorship to democracy.

But his popularity sank in later years due to a series of scandals, prompting him to step down in 2014.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",Nagorno-Karabakh says its two largest cities under fierce attack,"By Margarita Antidze
TBILISI (Reuters) - Three residents of Nagorno-Karabakh's largest city were killed during overnight shelling by Azeri forces, the enclave's ethnic Armenian-controlled Emergency and Rescue Service said on Friday, as the battle for control of its major settlements intensified.
Azerbaijan denied the reports of shelling in Stepanakert. Two independent observers said fighting appeared to be moving deeper into the enclave, with Azeri troops stepping up attacks on its biggest two cities.
At least 1,000 people - and possibly many more - have died in nearly six weeks of fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.
The conflict has underlined the influence of Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan, in a former Soviet region long dominated by Moscow, which has a defence pact with Armenia. It also threatens the security of Azeri oil and gas pipelines.
The Nagorno-Karabakh Emergency and Rescue Service said residential buildings and public infrastructure in Stepanakert had been targeted. It said that the three people killed had been inside the same house.
Reuters was unable independently to verify these reports. Three sources working in Stepanakert said that the city - known in Azerbaijan as Khankendi - had come under heavy shelling late on Thursday.
Shushi, 15 km (9 miles) to the south and the enclave's second-largest city, had also come under bombardment overnight and several houses were on fire, the Emergency and Rescue Service said. The city is of strategic importance to both sides.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said allegations that it had shelled civilian areas were ""misinformation"".
It has previously accused Armenian-controlled forces of shelling cities under its control, including Terter and Barda, as well as Ganja, the second-largest city in Azerbaijan. Dozens were killed in those attacks.
Thomas de Waal, analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of a book on the 1990s Nagorno-Karabakh war, said the conflict appeared to be moving toward a potentially bloody battle for Shushi, known to Azeris as Shusha.
""Shusha has great importance for Azerbaijanis, as a cultural and historical centre and the town where they had a majority population before the war,"" de Waal told Reuters.
""That is almost certainly why their military operation was diverted from Lachin towards the city,"" he said. ""It has great importance for Armenians too: it sits above Stepanakert and is the site of Karabakh's cathedral.""
BROKEN CEASEFIRES
Three ceasefires have failed to halt the bloodiest fighting in the South Caucasus for more than 25 years. Both sides accused each other of launching attacks within hours of an agreement on Oct. 30 to avoid deliberately targeting civilians.
The Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry said combat operations continued overnight along all major sections of the front line. It said that ""multiple attempts"" to attack Shushi were repelled.
Olesya Vartanyan, Crisis Group's Tbilisi-based senior analyst for the South Caucasus, told Reuters that fighting near Shushi had ""been intensifying during the last week, with more face-to-face clashes closer to the town"".
""The side that controls Shushi automatically gains control over Stepanakert,"" she said. ""Even if Baku decides to stop the war after taking Shushi, this will still significantly decrease the chance of ethnic Armenians returning to their homes in Stepanakert.""
The Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry says 1,177 of its troops have been killed. Azerbaijan does not disclose its military casualties, while Russia has estimated 5,000 deaths on both sides.

Around 30,000 people were killed in the 1991-94 war.

Thaci, a wartime hero turned politician, arrived at the detention centre of the Kosovo Specialist Chambers in The Hague on Thursday night after a war crimes indictment was confirmed against him.
His sudden departure could bring political instability to Kosovo, a fledgling democracy where the 52-year-old former guerrilla became the first prime minister in 2008 and was elected president in 2016.
In court, Thaci will have the charges explained by a judge and will be able to enter a plea during an initial appearance at 3 PM local time (1400 GMT), the court said in a statement on Friday.
Prosecutors say Thaci allegedly was responsible for nearly 100 murders of civilians during the 1998-99 war when he was a commander with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) leading the fight against forces under late Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
His indictment, made public on Thursday, accused him of heading a criminal enterprise that targeted opponents, who were abducted, interrogated and mistreated. He is charged with 10 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
Thaci has denied all the allegations.
In Kosovo, many see the KLA commanders as heroes who freed the country from Serbia's repressive regime against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.

The Kosovo tribunal was set up in 2015 to handle cases relating to alleged crimes by KLA members during and after the 1998-99 conflict, which led to Kosovo's independence from Serbia a decade later in 2008.

""We are doing a social lockdown of Oslo,"" the governing mayor of Oslo, Raymond Johansen, told a news conference. ""The numbers are clear. The number of infected cases is rising.""
The rules take effect on Monday at 2300 GMT. They will end in three weeks if the authorities see a fall in new infections. 
The announcement comes a day after Prime Minister Erna Solberg announced a fresh round of recommendations and restrictions, including telling Norwegians to avoid travelling domestically and to stay at home as much as possible.
Norway's 14-day cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was 105.3 as of Friday, the third-lowest in Europe behind Finland and Estonia, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
But there are regional disparities and authorities are most concerned about the situation in Oslo and Bergen, the second-largest city. 
In Oslo, the 14-day cumulative number of new COVID-19 cases was 192.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, local authorities said, with 5.2% of people tested for the disease returning positive results. 
""1 in 4 people do not know how they were infected,"" said Robert Steen, the city's head of health services.

In the town of Kumba on Thursday, hundreds of people came to pay their respects as the children's coffins, draped in the Cameroonian flag, were laid next to their portraits. Gospel choirs sang and speakers offered prayers.
The children were buried later in separate funerals.
""My heart bleeds a lot because her death was so tragic,"" said Rhema's weeping mother, Manyi Tita. ""My daughter never committed any crime. The only thing she did was go to school for a better future and ... to be a better lady.""
The outdoor ceremony represented an outpouring of grief but also anger that a conflict between separatist insurgents and the Cameroonian army had spiralled so far that a group of men with AK 47 rifles could walk into a school and open fire indiscriminately.
No-one has claimed responsibility for the shooting, but it carried the hallmarks of previous attacks by English-speaking separatists who have been fighting since 2017 to break away from the mainly French-speaking Central African country. 
The killing was followed by the kidnapping of eleven teachers during raids on two schools. They were released on Thursday.

""This struggle must continue but our children must go to school,"" said mourner Kalin Nkendoh. ""If the boys (the secessionists) think they want to use our children's schools as shields, as a weapon, they have failed.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's top military commander said on Friday a tense border standoff with Chinese forces in the western Himalayas could spark a larger conflict, even as senior commanders from both sides met near the frontline for their eighth round of talks.
Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat said the situation was tense at the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border, in eastern Ladakh, where thousands of Indian and Chinese troops are locked in a months-long confrontation.
""We will not accept any shifting of the Line of Actual Control,"" Rawat said in an online address.
""In the overall security calculus, border confrontations, transgressions and unprovoked tactical military actions spiralling into a larger conflict cannot therefore be discounted,"" he said.
Brutal hand-to-hand combat in June left 20 Indian and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers dead, escalating tensions and triggering large deployments on the remote, desolate border area.
Both sides have since attempted to ease the situation through diplomatic and military channels, but have made little headway, leaving soldiers facing-off in sub-zero temperatures in Ladakh's snow deserts.
Senior Indian and Chinese commanders were meeting on Friday in Ladakh, the eight round of talks between the military leaderships since the crisis began, officials in New Delhi said.
The talks would likely include discussions on a Chinese proposal to pull some troops back from a contested area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso lake, where soldiers were separated by a few hundred metres, according to an Indian official.

Infantry troops, backed by artillery and armoured vehicles, are also facing off on the southern bank of the lake, where China has been pushing India to pull back, the official said.

More than half of Myanmar's 53 million people use the social media platform, which for many is synonymous with the internet.
In its monthly report, Facebook said it had taken down a network of 36 accounts and six pages run by a Myanmar public relations agency, Openmind, because it said they were using fictitious people to promote the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP).
In a response posted on its Facebook account, Openmind said it was not involved in any political activities and did not create any accounts for USDP.
USDP spokeswoman Ya Min Myint Swe said she had no knowledge of the public relations agency.
Reuters reported on Friday that dozens of Facebook pages in Myanmar were spreading ethnically and religiously charged falsehoods ahead of Sunday's general election, including some pages linked to networks run by the Myanmar military.
Separately, Facebook took down on Friday over three dozen pages publishing Myanmar-related content flagged by Reuters that the social media company said was connected to separate spam networks it dismantled last month. 
The pages had ""clickbait"" content including on celebrity gossip and misinformation on the coronavirus. Some had up to a million followers.
A report by social media analytics firm Graphika in October found the spam networks would redirect users to advertising-heavy websites with some political and pro-military content.
Graphika researchers Victoire Rio and Myat Thu told Reuters they were currently monitoring over 900 similar clickbait pages, with a combined 225 million followers.
While considered primarily financially motivated, Rio warned that such pages could be hired out or co-opted by political actors for events such as the upcoming Myanmar election.

""By leveraging their various Facebook pages and groups, these actors have the power to turn any story, true or false, into national news within the space of a few hours,"" Rio said.

""America is more than a one-man show. Anyone who continues to pour oil on the fire in a situation like this is acting irresponsibly,"" Maas told Germany's Funke media in unusually blunt language.
""Now is the time to keep a cool head until an independently determined result is available,"" he added in some of his first comments on the situation.
Counting was continuing in the extremely close U.S. presidential election which hinges on razor-thin margins in a handful of states. Republican President Donald Trump has launched a flurry of lawsuits hoping to slow down his opponent, Democrat Joe Biden, and tensions have risen in some places.
""In order for the result - which has not yet been determined - to be accepted, everyone must first show restraint,"" Maas told Funke media in an interview, extracts of which he tweeted. ""That includes us.""
""Decent losers are more important for the functioning of a democracy than radiant winners,"" he added.
Biden took a narrow lead over Trump in the battleground state of Georgia for the first time early on Friday, putting the White House within his reach.
""With such narrow majorities, it is very easy to find yourself on the losing side,"" Maas said. ""This shows how important it is to work to bridge the political divide.""
Maas said he expected that once the election result is settled, ""the USA will probably not return to the international stage with full energy for the time being"", but he added: ""The world needs the USA as a force for order, not as a factor of chaos.""

Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who now heads the main centre-right grouping in the European Parliament, said Kaczynski and Trump used similar strategies of dividing society and using propaganda to keep their hold on power.
Known for his no-holds-barred comments, Tusk said Trump's attempts to halt ballot counting after Tuesday's presidential election were a blow to U.S. democracy, and also said that if he were not against corporal punishment he would ""spank"" Kaczynski, his longtime arch rival in Polish politics.
""This is characteristic of the rules of the radical right,"" Tusk told private television broadcaster TVN24, commenting on the actions of both Trump and Kaczynski.
""If we look at Trump's behaviour, especially in the recent hours... or at Jaroslaw Kaczynski, then their common feature is that they behave like the most bad-tempered brats in a sandpit ... Conflict, unjustified aggression, is their element,"" said Tusk.
Trump has falsely claimed that the U.S. election is being ""stolen"" from him, as his Democratic challenger Joe Biden gains more ground on him in the battleground states of Georgia and Pennsylvania on Friday. He has sought to portray as fraudulent the slow counting of mail-in ballots.
Like Trump, Kaczynski, leader of Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), stands accused by his critics of stoking social tensions. Kaczynski said during recent massive street protests that a top court's ruling that amounts to a near total ban on abortion cannot be reversed and demanded that Poles defend the church.
Asked what he would say to Kaczynski, Tusk said: ""If I were not a staunch opponent of corporal punishment, I think that one would actually have to spank him, because he sometimes behaves like a monstrous, unbearable brat.""
A spokeswoman of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, led by Kaczynski, was not immediately available to comment. 
Throughout his nearly four-year presidency Trump has stirred strong emotions among both supporters and opponents.
Tusk also said that Trump's calls to stop counting the votes were a ""brutal blow to the essence of American democracy"".
He added that if Biden were to win, relations between the United States and the European Union would improve.

""Donald Trump, and I witnessed that, has criticized the EU, comparing it to China. He wasn't hiding his deep antipathy to united Europe. Joe Biden is the opposite of Trump in this respect - he is very attached to the traditional Euro-American bond,"" Tusk also said.

Commenting on Trump tweeting ""STOP THE COUNT!"" on Thursday, as the election race in the United States went to the wire, 17-year-old Thunberg tweeted: ""So ridiculous.

The tweet has been liked 1.2 million times so far and re-tweeted 266,000 times. 
Trump took to Twitter in December last year after Thunberg was named Time's Person of the Year for 2019, mocking the 17-year-old in exactly the same manner for her impassioned pleas to governments to act to stop global warming. 
""So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"" Trump wrote, commenting on a tweet from another person congratulating Thunberg on the Time prize.
Thunberg responded at the time by updating her Twitter biography to include: ""A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old-fashioned movie with a friend.""
With his re-election chances fading as more votes are counted in a handful of battleground states, U.S. President Donald Trump launched an extraordinary assault on the country's democratic process from the White House on Thursday, falsely claiming the election was being ""stolen"" from him.

The social media platform announced it had taken down the new networks as part of its monthly report into ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"", which also noted Facebook had removed nearly 8,000 pages involved in deceptive campaigns around the world in October.
Many of the networks taken down by Facebook were involved in deceptive political influence campaigns using fake accounts, targeting audiences both domestically and abroad.
One network of Facebook accounts and pages was operated from Egypt, Turkey, and Morocco by individuals connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian Islamist movement that operates networks of groups across the Middle East. The pages targeted countries across the region and included some terrorism-related content, Facebook said.
Facebook found two ""inauthentic"" networks in Georgia spreading political content, one of which the platform traced to individuals associated with two political parties.
In Ukraine and Myanmar, the social media giant found that public relations firms were running similar deceptive campaigns on behalf of political parties.

The company has been cracking down on such accounts globally after coming under fire for not developing tools quickly enough to combat extremist content and propaganda operations.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The head of the United Nations said he was deeply alarmed by fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, where federal troops have been exchanging fire with the powerful ethnic faction that led the ruling coalition for decades. 
Prime Minister's Abiy Ahmed's government is mobilising troops from around the country and sending them to Tigray, after two days of clashes between government forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
""The stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region. I call for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and a peaceful resolution to the dispute,"" U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said in a message on Twitter seen on Friday.
Sporadic sounds of shelling could be heard from Aburafi town, near the Tigray-Amhara border, at 3 a.m local time (0000 GMT) on Friday, a humanitarian worker in the area told Reuters. 
The conflict has pitted government troops against the TPLF, for decades the dominant political force in the country's multi-ethnic ruling coalition, until Abiy, a member of the Oromo ethnic group, took office two years ago.
Abiy, who has tried to open up what has long been one of the most restrictive economic and political systems in Africa, reorganised the ruling coalition into a single party which the TPLF refused to join.
Countries in the region fear that the crisis could escalate into all-out war under Abiy, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a decades-old conflict with neighbouring Eritrea but has failed to prevent outbreaks of ethnic unrest.
The Tigray administration, which is led by president Debretsion Gebremichael, said on Thursday it was well equipped to deal with an attack from any direction.
Two Ethiopian fighter jets were seen flying over Mekelle, the capital of Tigray, on Thursday afternoon, two diplomatic sources told Reuters, in what was described as a show of force by the Ethiopian National Defence Forces.

Ethiopia closed the airspace over Tigray to all flights on Thursday, the country's civil aviation authority said in a statement, and closed all the international and domestic flight routes that traverse its northern airspace.

Usually caused by contact with animals, the outbreak in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, was due to a leak at a vaccine plant, according to Lanzhou's health commission. People are still being treated at hospitals even though the outbreak happened a year ago.
China's top legislative body passed a law last month to establish protocols for biosecurity risk prevention and control, and systems to respond to risks including sudden outbreaks.
WHAT IS BRUCELLOSIS?
Brucellosis is a zoonotic infectious disease, or a disease in animals that can spread to humans. It is caused by a bacteria that affects sheep, goats, cattle, swine and even dogs and is reported in many countries.
Humans generally get the disease from direct contact with infected animals through the consumption of tainted animal products such as unpasteurised milk or cheese, or through the inhalation of airborne agents.
Human-to-human transmission is extremely rare, according to the World Health Organization.
Symptoms in humans include fever and weakness, which emerge over a few weeks. The mortality rate is low, though complications could lead to death. Some symptoms such as joint pain may become chronic and never go away.
WHAT HAPPENED IN LANZHOU?
The latest outbreak in Lanzhou was first uncovered in November 2019 when some students at the Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute tested positive for brucellosis. By the end of December, at least 181 people at the institute had been infected, according to the provincial health authority.
The outbreak even spread to Heilongjiang province in the northeastern corner of China, where 13 people who worked at the veterinarian institute in August 2019 tested positive, state media reported.
The government has tested 55,725 people in the city, of which 6,620 are positive for brucellosis as of now, the Lanzhou government said at a press conference, according to a report on Thursday by the state-owned Global Times.
The outbreak originated at a biopharmaceutical factory owned by Shanghai-listed China Animal Husbandry Industry Co, according to a statement from Lanzhou's health commission in September.
The factory had used expired disinfectants in July to August 2019 to make brucellosis vaccines, leaving the bacteria in its waste gas. The contaminated gas later formed aerosols that drifted downwind to the veterinary institute.
IS BRUCELLOSIS COMMON IN CHINA?
About half a million infected people are reported each year around the world, with China typically accounting for tens of thousands.
In 2019, China reported 44,036 cases with one death, up from 37,947 cases and zero deaths a year earlier.
The very first cases reported in China were in the southwestern city of Chongqing in 1905. China saw a widespread epidemic of brucellosis in the 1950s and 1960s, according to state media.
Brucellosis is more common in pastoral areas in the west and north of China. It is categorized as a Class B infectious disease under a three-tier system

Last year, China reported over 10 million cases of infectious diseases including brucellosis, scarlet fever, dysentery and dengue.

In separate vote results, New Zealanders narrowly rejected the legalisation of recreational marijuana while deciding to push ahead with laws to legalise euthanasia.
Ardern's Labour Party increased its majority to 65 seats from 64 in the 120-seat assembly, according to final NZ Electoral Commission results. The results included an additional 500,000 special votes, some of them mailed in from overseas. 
""There are significant challenges for us to overcome together but I am confident we have the team to do it and it is great to be officially able to now crack on with it,"" Ardern said in Wellington after the full results were released. 
The 20-strong new-look cabinet includes eight women.
The final results compounded the election-day disaster suffered by the opposition National Party, which was in power as recently as 2017. The party dropped two seats to 33 in parliament after the additional votes were tallied.
The Maori Party, representing the indigenous community that makes up about 15% of the population, picked up an additional seat to secure two representatives in the new parliament.
New Zealanders voted in the referendums on marijuana and euthanasia while casting ballots in the general election.
A thin 50.7% majority voted against the legalisation of recreational cannabis use while nearly two-thirds of voters supported a bill to allow people who meet certain requirements ask for medical assistance to end their lives, the Electoral Commission's full results showed.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump administration advances $2.9 billion drone sale to UAE - sources,"By Mike Stone and Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department gave Congress notification it plans to sell 18 sophisticated armed MQ-9B aerial drones to the United Arab Emirates in a deal worth as much as $2.9 billion, people briefed on the notification said.
The move comes on the heels of last week's notification of a potential sale of F-35 fighter jets to the middle-eastern country.
This would mark the first armed drone export since the Trump administration reinterpreted a Cold War-era arms agreement between 34 nations to allow U.S. defense contractors to sell more drones to allies.
Reuters has reported that UAE has long shown interest in purchasing drones from the United States and would be among the first customers in line after U.S. export policy changed this summer. A $600 million deal to sell four unarmed but weapons-ready MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones to Taiwan was the first to be formally notified to Congress on Tuesday.
This informal notification for the Reaper-style drones is the precursor to the State Department's formal and public notification.
The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees - whose members have criticized UAE's role in civilian deaths in Yemen's civil war - have the ability to review and block weapons sales under an informal review process before the State Department sends its formal notification to the legislative branch.
The U.S. State Department may wait to formally notify Congress of the sale once staff and members are briefed on the potential sale, one of the people said. The formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales.
A U.S. State Department spokesman told Reuters, ""As a matter of policy, the United States does not confirm or comment on proposed defense sales or transfers until they are formally notified to Congress.""
The armed MQ-9B drones will also be equipped with maritime radar and could be delivered in 2024. The package notified to Congress is for 15 with an option for three additional drones, one of the people said. 
The UAE is also seeking a package of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co EA-18G Growlers, an electronic warfare version of the two-seat F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft, that are capable of jamming radar and other advanced capabilities. Growlers are operated buy the U.S. and Australia. 
The United Arab Emirates, one of Washington's closest Middle East allies, has long expressed interest in acquiring the stealthy F-35 jets and was promised a chance to buy them in a side deal made when they agreed to normalize relations with Israel. The informal notification for 50  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co F-35 jets was made on Oct. 29.

But any deal the U.S. makes to sell weapons in the region must satisfy decades of agreement with Israel where the U.S.-made weapon must not impair Israel's ""qualitative military edge,"" guaranteeing U.S. weapons furnished to Israel are ""superior in capability"" to those sold to its neighbors.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>",'Not guilty': Mexican ex-army chief pleads in high stakes cartel case,"(Reuters) - Former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos pleaded not guilty to drug charges on Thursday in a case that has put U.S.-Mexican cooperation in the fight against powerful cartels to the test.
Cienfuegos, a top player in Mexico's war on drug gangs until two years ago, was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport last month in a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operation. 
He was transferred this week to Brooklyn, New York, where he is detained and faces trial.
Cienfuegos, 72, served as defense minister for six years under former President Enrique Pena Nieto. The arrest shocked the Mexican military establishment and has put strains on security cooperation with the United States, which has become increasingly close over the past 30 years. 
Building the case off intercepted Blackberry (TSX:BB) messages, prosecutors say Cienfuegos used his power in office to protect a faction of the Beltran-Leyva cartel, directing operations against rival gangs and even finding maritime transport to ship drugs.
Judge Steven Gold accepted the plea, made via a video link at a Brooklyn federal court. Cienfuegos is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a troubled and crowded jail that also holds Ghislaine Maxwell.
The next court date is set for Nov. 18 before U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon, said a spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme in Brooklyn. The proceeding is currently scheduled to be in-person. 
Before the hearing, Edward Sapone, a lawyer for Cienfuegos, said his client was presumed innocent of the charges in the four-count indictment.
""My legal team and I will ensure that Gen. Cienfuegos' constitutional rights are protected as we zealously defend him,"" Sapone said in a statement. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has criticized the lack of information shared prior to the arrest of Cienfugos and warned of a review of cooperation agreements.
He has also questioned the role of the DEA and other U.S. agencies in Mexico, saying they worked closely for years with officials later accused of collaborating with criminals.
The president said he will shortly announce a review of the terms of cooperation with U.S. agencies in Mexico, as well as how such arrest warrants are issued.
""Regardless of whether Cienfuegos is guilty or not, all of this is now being questioned by the armed forces in Mexico; they're very angry,"" said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador in Washington.
Sapone has experience working with the Mexican government. He previously defended an ""advisor to a Mexican president,"" according to his website. His current clients include the Mexican consulate in New York. 
Sapone said the consulate had been a client for 19 years. He said his work for Cienfuegos was unrelated, but that the consulate was aware and ""pleased."" 

The Mexican foreign ministry said the government was not involved in financing Cienfuegos' legal costs and said it had not signed any contract with Sapone's firm related to his defense.

TEGUCIGALPA/GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - The remnants of Hurricane Eta unleashed torrential rains and catastrophic flooding on Central America, with fatalities sharply up on Thursday as streets turned into rivers and dozens more were feared to be buried in their homes by mudslides.
More than 70 people were killed across the region of mostly poor countries nestled between Mexico and Colombia, and hundreds were stranded on rooftops or cut off by floods.
In Guatemala, the death toll shot up past 50 over the course of Thursday, according to President Alejandro Giammattei, who said mudslides around the town of San Cristobal Verapaz had swallowed about 25 homes.
""Right now, we're trying to get there on foot because there's no other way,"" said Giammattei, referring to flooded out roads near the town, located about 120 miles (193 km) north of the Guatemalan capital.
In neighboring Honduras, families waded through flooded streets of the northern city of San Pedro Sula, while cars sat almost submerged in parts of the central Guatemalan city of San Pedro Carcha, television footage and images posted on social media showed.
Hundreds of people were left stranded on roofs in Honduras as frantic rescue efforts played out, which were credited with taking around 500 people to safety.
""We will not leave the area until we rescue the last person,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told local television, adding that rescue efforts led by police, soldiers and firefighters will continue overnight.
Damage and destruction had spread across most of Honduras and speedboats and helicopters would be sent to take people to safety in inaccessible areas, Hernandez said earlier in the day.
One of the fiercest storms to hit Central America in years, Eta struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Tuesday with winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph) before weakening to a tropical depression as it moved inland and into neighboring Honduras.
By Thursday, authorities confirmed at least seven deaths in Honduras. Media in Nicaragua also reported two miners had died in a mudslide.
Guatemala's disaster relief agency Conred had earlier said about 15 homes were likely covered by mudslides, possibly affecting around 75 people.
Giammattei had already declared a state of emergency in nearly half of the country's 22 departments.
In both Guatemala and Panama, several people have been reported missing as water levels continue to rise.
In southern Costa Rica, a landslide killed two people in a house, a Costa Rican woman and an American man, officials said. Meanwhile, five people, including three children, died in flooding in Panama's Chiriqui province, near the Costa Rica border, authorities said.
There was at least one silver lining in Honduras, where 60 fishermen who disappeared at sea on Tuesday returned after taking shelter on cays until they were rescued, said community leader Robin Morales.
Calling their survival a ""miracle,"" Morales said a man among them presumed dead from a heart attack also made it back.
""Our friends are alive, thank God,"" he said.
Across swaths of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica, high winds and heavy rain have damaged homes, roads and bridges, forcing thousands to take cover in shelters.
Eta was moving northwest over Honduras and Belize and headed toward the Caribbean, at eight miles per hour (13 kph) on Thursday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Heavy rains continued and the storm's top winds edged up to 35 mph (56 kph).

Eta is forecast to return to sea and regain momentum as a tropical storm, possibly reaching the Cayman Islands, Cuba and southern Florida in the coming days, the NHC said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - At a workshop in the South Korean capital, two environmental activists melt down old plastic bottle caps that thousands of volunteers known as ""sparrows"" have collected in a bid to fight a tide of plastic the novel coronavirus has helped unleash.
Green activists Kim Yona and Lee Dong-I use the bottle caps to make a tube-squeezing device - something they hope consumers will find useful and be able to keep, rather than toss out after just one use.
""Plastic is a recyclable resource,"" said Kim, 26. ""But it’s way too cheap, easy to make and easily thrown away, which makes people think it's disposable.""
The environmentalists opened their ""Plastic Mill"" in downtown Seoul in July, attracting 2,000 volunteer ""sparrows"" - the name comes from a Korean expression about the bird that can't resist stopping at a mill to peck - who gathered an estimated 85,330 bottle caps in a collection drive.
Unlike bottles, the caps are usually discarded at recycling facilities as they need extra work to sort, the activists said.
The ""sparrows"" get one upcycled tube-squeezer as a reward, no matter how many caps they bring in.
""We can't reward them for sending lots of plastic, our goal is to reduce it,"" said Lee.
The coronavirus has led to a surge of takeaway food and drink in South Korea, as elsewhere, fuelling a 14.6% increase in plastic production - to 6,800 tonnes in the first eight months of the year, according to environment ministry data.
""I've never seen so much single-use plastic,"" said Lee Yong-gi, a 40-year veteran of the recycling business.
""If we don’t recycle it, it goes to landfill.”
But low oil prices are undermining the profitability of recycling, and not all waste that gets to facilities is actually recycled.
The recycling rate for collected waste fell to 40.6% in 2019 compared with 57.9 percent in 2015, according to lawmaker Lee Soo-jin, citing government data.
The activists know their project won't end the problem.

""Plastic Mill can't be the solution,"" said Lee. ""The problem is not plastic, it's because we use it just once. We have to reduce plastic and reuse it. Upcycling is the last resort.""

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",Thai 'Drag Race' star marches for democracy and equality,"By Chalinee Thirasupa
BANGKOK (Reuters) - With flawless makeup and costume that blends cabaret with catwalk and rainbow pride with royal court pageantry, Aunchalee Pokinwuttipob symbolises how Thailand's protests are about much more than calls for a change of government.
Aunchalee, 26, is a drag queen and reality television show winner who is riding the momentum of youth rallies against the military and royalist establishment, hoping to advance a drawn-out struggle for same-sex marriage and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights.
Alongside the broader calls for greater democracy, is anger at government failure to change laws and policies that transgender Thais see as discriminatory.
""We really want human rights. We've wanted it for a long time. It's related to freedom of speech and equality,"" said Aunchalee, better known by the stage name, Angele Anang.
""This is a new phenomenon in Thailand, because they didn't have this kind of opportunity to speak up in the past."" 
Aunchalee's outfits stand out in a sea of student protesters who often opt for black t-shirts: matching a technicolour dress with the golden ""chada"" crown of a Thai royal folk dancer, a rainbow umbrella with a silk dress cut to ribbons and a tight, low-cut shirt with a leather cap and frizzy white wig. 
The demonstrations started in July, taking aim initially at prime minister and former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, accusing him of clinging to power and harassing opponents.
They have since made unheralded calls for a curbing of the powers of a monarchy that the protesters say has enabled decades of military domination.
Starting from universities, colleges and schools, the appeal of the rallies has broadened, tapping festering frustrations with conservative elite rule over a country where younger generations are known for openness and free-wheeling attitudes. 
It is a battle Aunchalee has fought at home in Ayutthaya near Bangkok.
Born the eldest son to a blacksmith, Aunchalee gets along with her monarchist father but rarely sees him and is unable to have a proper conversation with him about gender, identity and her role in the protests. 
""We have problems, every time I express my opinions,"" Aunchalee said. ""Thailand nowadays is no longer like what it was before.
""I feel bad because they chose to sever the ties to me.""
Aunchalee dropped out of school at 15 and headed to Bangkok to star in cabaret shows, specialising with a Beyonce Knowles (NYSE:KN) medley.
She started performing in bars in 2018 in the city's Patpong area, a lure for tourists, earning more and a chance to star in reality show ""Drag Race"", building a social media following that has expanded further since joining the protests.
Aunchalee supports the push to remove a government she says is out of touch with its people and she talks openly about a need to reform the monarchy in order to preserve it.
The demonstrations are also a rare window to push for greater liberalism and remove obstacles for LGBT people, she said, in areas like employment, marriage, inheritance, adopting children and joint ownership of property.

""I want equality and justice,"" Aunchalee said. ""A law that can be applied in the same way.""

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark announced strict new lockdown rules on Thursday in the north of the country after authorities discovered a mutated coronavirus strain in minks bred in the region, prompting a nationwide cull that will devastate the large pelt industry.
The government said on Wednesday that it would cull all minks - up to 17 million - to prevent human contagion with a mutated coronavirus, which authorities said could be more resistant against future vaccines.
Seven municipalities in northern Denmark, home to most of the country's mink farms, will face restrictions on movement across county lines, while restaurants and bars will be closed, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a press conference. 
Schools will be closed and all public transport will be shut until Dec 3., she said, encouraging inhabitants in the region to stay within their municipality and get tested.
For Denmark's mink pelt industry, which racked up exports of around $800 million last year and employs 4,000 people, the cull could amount to a death knell. The industry association for Danish breeders called the move a ""black day for Denmark"".
""Of course, we must not be the cause of a new pandemic. We do not know the professional basis for this assessment and risk ... but the government's decision is a disaster for the industry and Denmark,"" chairman Tage Pedersen said.
At his family-owned mink farm west of the capital Copenhagen, 34-year-old Hans Henrik Jeppesen said he was devastated by the decision.
""This is a very, very sad situation for me and my family,"" he told Reuters. Jeppesen's 36,000 minks have not been infected, but will be culled and skinned within the next 10 days.
Some lawmakers demanded to see the evidence behind such drastic action.
""We are asking to have it (the evidence) sent over, so we can assess the technical basis,"" a spokesperson for the Liberal Party told broadcaster TV2 on Wednesday.
MORE RESTRICTIONS
Outbreaks at mink farms have persisted in Denmark, Europe's largest producer and exporter of mink furs, despite repeated efforts to cull infected animals since June.
Animal rights groups welcomed the mass cull imposed by the government, and called for a general ban on what they said was an ""outdated"" industry.
""Although not a ban on fur farming, this move signals the end of suffering for millions of animals confined to small wire cages on Danish fur farms,"" said Joanna Swabe of Humane Society International.
In a meeting with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control held earlier on Thursday, experts agreed with Denmark's strategy to tackle the situation, state epidemiologist Kare Molbak said.
Hans Kluge, WHO European regional director, said Denmark showed ""determination and courage"" in the face of a decision to cull its mink population, which has a ""huge economic impact"".
While no coronavirus has been detected on mink farms in Poland, another major mink pelt producer, authorities in Sweden on Thursday imposed restrictions on mink farms after infections were found.
However, they have not observed the mutation found in neighbouring Denmark.
RISK TO FUTURE VACCINES
In a report published on Wednesday, the State Serum Institute (SSI), the authority dealing with infectious diseases, said laboratory tests showed the new strain had mutations on its so-called spike protein, a part of the virus that invades and infects healthy cells.
That poses a risk to future COVID-19 vaccines, which are based on disabling the spike protein, SSI said. 
Ian Jones, a virology professor at Britain's University of Reading, said the virus would be expected to mutate in a new species.
""It must adapt to be able to use mink receptors to enter cells and so will modify the spike protein to enable this to happen efficiently,"" he explained.
""The danger is that the mutated virus could then spread back into man and evade any vaccine response which would have been designed to the original, non-mutated version of the spike protein, and not the mink-adapted version.""
Authorities in Denmark said five cases of the new virus strain had been recorded on mink farms and 12 cases in humans.
James Wood, a professor of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, cautioned that the true implication of the changes in the spike protein had not yet been fully assessed by scientists.

""It is too early to say that the change will cause either vaccines or immunity to fail,"" he said.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria's opposition parties lambasted the government on Thursday over its admitted mishandling of intelligence that might have prevented a deadly rampage in Vienna this week, accusing it of trying to shift the blame onto others.
A 20-year-old native of the city, who had previously been jailed for trying to join Islamic State in Syria, was shot dead by police within nine minutes of opening fire on bystanders and bars on Monday. He killed four people.
Fifteen arrests have been made since the attack, but Interior Minister Karl Nehammer conceded on Wednesday that ""some things went wrong"" in processing intelligence from neighbouring Slovakia in July that the attacker had tried to buy ammunition.
Nehammer and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz have also said, however, that the attacker was released from prison too soon because he fooled a deradicalisation programme as to his rehabilitation. The organisation running the programme denies that.
""I am appalled. I don't know about surprised, but I am still very upset that it took you less than 24 hours for you, Mr Chancellor and you, Mr Interior Minister, to start blaming others in the justice system,"" the head of the liberal Neos party, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, told parliament.
Nehammer and Kurz are both from the conservative People's Party (OVP).
EARLY RELEASE
The attacker was released early in December last year and his sentence would have run until July of this year. 
In his speech to parliament Kurz pointed to the early release and said the attacker lived free and undetected ""only because he falsely declared to turn his back on terror"".
The organisation that runs the programme, Derad, has said that was not true, because the court ruling on his early release made no mention of deradicalisation and his case officer never said he was deradicalised.
In an interview on ORF TV on Wednesday evening Justice Minister Alma Zadic, from Kurz's junior coalition partner the Greens, did not go into specifics on the case but said the deradicalisation programme and those who are enrolled in it should be monitored more closely.
Interior Minister Nehammer has also accused his predecessor Herbert Kickl, of the far-right Freedom Party, of weakening the country's main intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BVT).
The leader of the Social Democrats, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, said that while Kurz was calling for the country to unite, he was in fact doing the opposite.

""When will you understand that it is never the time, especially not now, to shift responsibility? That now, in this difficult moment, it is not the time to blame each other within the government?"" she said.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo President Hashim Thaci, a wartime hero turned politician, resigned with immediate effect on Thursday after learning that a tribunal in The Hague had confirmed a war crimes indictment against him.
Thaci told a news conference in the Kosovo capital Pristina that he felt his resignation was necessary ""to protect the integrity of the state"".
Thaci arrived at Pristina's military airport in the afternoon to be flown to The Hague, where he would be taken into custody by the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, Kosovo-based newspaper Koha Ditore reported.
The move could bring political instability to Kosovo, a young democracy where the 52-year-old former guerrilla became the first prime minister in 2008 and was elected president in 2016.
Prosecutors hold Thaci responsible for nearly 100 murders of civilians during the 1998-99 war when he was a KLA commander who fought the Serbian police and army. He denies any wrongdoing.
Thaci, a U.S.-backed national hero, embarked on his political career after leading the Kosovo Liberation Army's battle against forces under late Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 1998-1999.
Thaci has long enjoyed U.S. political support. Ties with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump deepened in September, when Kosovo and Serbia signed an economic relations deal at the White House.
Trump was given Kosovo's highest state honor for his role in securing the deal, and he boasted about bringing peace to the Balkans during his re-election campaign.
The European Union on Thursday welcomed Thaci's cooperation with the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, where he is expected to come before a pre-trial judge in coming days.
The tribunal was set up in 2015 to handle cases relating to the war that led to Kosovo's independence from Serbia a decade later in 2008. The court is governed by Kosovo law but staffed by international judges and prosecutors.
ANGER IN KOSOVO
Many in Kosovo oppose the war crimes court and see the KLA commanders as heroes. 
""I think a big injustice is being committed here by putting on trial our liberators,"" economist Fejzullah Ibrahimi told Reuters at a market in Pristina.
NATO bombed Belgrade in 1999 with U.S. support to halt the killings and expulsions of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo by Serb forces.
Human rights watchdog Amnesty International said the indictment against Thaci gave hope to thousands of victims of the war ""who have waited for more than two decades to find out the truth about the horrific crimes.""
In Belgrade, lawmaker Milovan Drecun who is chairman of the Serbian parliamentary committee for Kosovo said the indictment proved that ""establishing the truth about war crimes of the KLA and punishing those responsible is an irreversible process.""
In July, Thaci met the prosecutors in The Hague to discuss the allegations against him. Another two Kosovo politicians and former KLA members - Rexhep Selimi, a deputy in the Kosovo parliament, and Kadri Veseli, the president of Thaci's Kosovo Democratic Party, also had indictments confirmed. 

On Wednesday, the former KLA spokesman and veteran Kosovo politician Jakup Krasniqi was arrested and transferred to The Hague on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, the court said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Europe must rethink its open-border Schengen area, including a more robust protection of the zone's external frontiers, President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday, after a spate of Islamist attacks in France and Austria.
The tighter controls were needed to curb clandestine immigration, said Macron, adding that the criminal gangs illegally trafficking migrants into Europe were often linked to terror networks.
""I am in favour of a deep overhaul of Schengen to re-think its organisation and to strengthen our common border security with a proper border force,"" Macron said on a visit to the Franco-Spanish border.
Macron said he would present proposals to European Union partners at a summit in December.
France will rally support before then and hopes Germany will put its name to the plan, a government official said, citing the Netherlands and Austria as other possible allies.
Europe is reeling from two attacks in the past week that involved assailants who moved freely between Schengen member states.
On Oct. 29, a Tunisian man killed three people in a church in Nice. Brahim Aouissaoui had arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa, which lies off North Africa, five weeks earlier. After being transferred to the mainland, Aouissaoui travelled into France by train hours before launching his attack.
The jihadist who killed four people in Vienna on Monday travelled to neighbouring Slovakia in July in an attempt to buy ammunition, Austrian officials said.
Macron said the recent attacks were a warning to Europe that ""the terrorist risk is everywhere"".
'TOO VULNERABLE'
Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio this week also pressed for Europe to bolster its defences against terrorism and again stressed the need for a revamp of EU immigration laws.
Referring to the attacks, he told the Corriere Della Sera daily on Wednesday: ""Anyone can enter a member state and cross Europe. The risk is too high, the European vulnerability too large.""
France did not want to restrict freedom of movement, the government official said. Instead, its proposals will be based on Macron's call last year for a more robust EU border force as well as obligations on member states to supply intelligence on people moving across Europe's borders.
The French president also wants the EU to have a single asylum policy to end the rows that have paralysed its policymaking during a years-long migrant crisis.
Nearly 628,000 non-EU citizens were found to be illegally present in the bloc in 2019, up 10% on the previous year, according to Eurostat data.
Macron said France would double the number of police manning its borders.
""We need to bolster our fight against illegal immigration and traffickers who, increasingly often, have links to terrorism,"" the president said.

The Schengen zone consists of 22 of the 27 European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein.

Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany after his alleged poisoning with a novichok nerve agent in Russia, posted images on social media of law enforcement officers at his group's offices in a business centre in Moscow. 
The RIA news agency cited bailiffs as saying the raid was linked to a criminal case against Ivan Zhdanov, director of Navalny's group, for failing to implement a court order, an apparent reference to a lawsuit payout. 
A court in Moscow ordered Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and Navalny supporter Lyubov Sobol last month each to pay 29 million roubles ($374,483) for libelling the Moscow Schoolchild catering company. 
The Kremlin's critics have cast those lawsuits, as well as a series of mass police raids, as part of a coordinated campaign aimed at crippling their activities. Russian authorities deny that.

A 20-year-old native of the city, who had previously been jailed for trying to join Islamic State in Syria, was shot dead by police within nine minutes of opening fire on bystanders and bars on Monday. He killed four people.
""We are dealing with a violent perpetrator who was evidently intensely involved in the network of political Islam, of sympathisers, who took on their ideology,"" Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said.

Of those four, two involved acts of violence like assault and two were for attempted so-called honour killings, Ruf said, adding: ""One can see that all are to be linked to the radical Islamist milieu"".
Switzerland has also arrested two men in connection with the attack, and Austria was in close contact with another unspecified country in its investigation, Nehammer said.

ABIDJAN/CONAKRY (Reuters) - For some Africans, President Donald Trump's actions in the aftermath of the U.S. election have been a cause for dark humour, while others reacted with dismay or disbelief.
In countries whose own recent elections were marred by accusations of cheating and violence, some expressed concern about what signal Trump's premature declaration of victory, allegations of fraud and flurry of lawsuits might send to their own leaders.
""Trump is setting a bad example for Africa and a country like ours. You cannot proclaim yourself in an election where you are a candidate when justice exists,"" said Mory Keïta, a car parts dealer in Guinea.
Dozens of people were killed in protests before and after the West African country's president won a contested third term last month.
""It's a total disgrace,"" said Bachir Diallo, a Guinean mining executive. ""Such a mess is worthy of a banana republic.""
As Democrat Joe Biden edged closer to victory over President Donald Trump, others felt a sharp sense of irony seeing events play out in a developed nation whose authorities regularly admonish African leaders for not respecting democratic norms.
Trump, who during the long and rancorous campaign attacked the integrity of the American voting system, has alleged fraud without providing evidence, filed lawsuits and called for at least one recount. 
When the U.S. Embassy in Guinea's neighbour Ivory Coast called on Wednesday for dialogue and commitment to the rule of law following another disputed presidential election, some people took umbrage.
""I believe the playground response is 'why you talking about yourself?'"" one Twitter user wrote.
""They tell us about democracy, it's simply a hoax. They don't mean it,"" said Maurice Nandasaba, as he caught up with friends near a newsstand in Kenya's capital Nairobi.
Some who followed the U.S. election found positives in what was happening across the Atlantic. 
""It's calm, and there is no violence,"" said Viviane Asseke, a schoolteacher in Ivory Coast, where more than 10 people have died in clashes since the president won a third term that opponents consider unconstitutional. 
""It makes you want to vote.""
But more people were disappointed. 
""You would think we're in Africa when you see Trump's behaviour,"" said Ange Kouame, 23, a student in Ivory Coast's main city, Abidjan. 
""It is terrifying to see this in America,"" said Tito Kisiya, a sales executive in Tanzania, whose presidential election last week drew criticism from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. 
In Africa's most populous nation Nigeria, where Trump has many admirers, some were critical of his actions.

""A soothsayer does not need to tell us that the America we are looking at as a model in everything is not even a model when it comes to electioneering,"" said Agbor Elemi, a consultant in Lagos.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Ethiopia mobilises for war in northern region,"By Giulia Paravicini and Dawit Endeshaw
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia mobilised for war in the northern Tigray region on Thursday, dashing international hopes of averting a conflict between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government and the powerful ethnic faction that led the ruling coalition for decades.
""Our country has entered into unexpected war... the war will not come to the centre, it will end there (in Tigray),"" the deputy chief of the army, Birhanu Jula, said on state television.
Troops were being mustered from around the country and dispatched to Tigray, he said. The announcement followed clashes on Wednesday between government forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), after Abiy ordered retaliation for what the government described as a TPLF attack on its troops.
Tigray regional president Debretsion Gebremichael said its forces had foiled a plan by the federal troops to use artillery and arms stationed there to attack the region.
""We will use the artillery to defend Tigray. We will use them to destroy an attack from any direction,"" he said on Tigray TV.
A humanitarian source in Tigray said shelling and shooting had been heard in the area since the early hours of Thursday, and nearly two dozen soldiers had been treated at a clinic near the border with the Amhara region. The source did not say which side of the conflict the injured troops were drawn from.
""At 5:20 a.m. we started to hear heavy shelling. Since then it has only stopped for an hour, but as of 2:00 p.m. you could still hear shooting, bombing and shelling,"" the source said.
""So far nearly two dozens injured - all military, no civilians - were treated in the health centre of Abdurafi, located near the Tigray-Amhara border.""
The conflict pits government troops against the TPLF, for decades the dominant political force in the country's multi-ethnic ruling coalition, until Abiy, a member of the Oromo ethnic group, took office two years ago.
Abiy, who has tried to open up what has long been one of the most restrictive economic and political systems in Africa, reorganised the ruling coalition into a single party which the TPLF refused to join.
Countries in the region fear that the crisis could escalate into all-out war under Abiy, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a decades-old conflict with neighbouring Eritrea but has failed to prevent outbreaks of ethnic unrest.
GOVERNMENT RESISTS TALKS, DIPLOMATS SAY 
Tensions with the TPLF have been escalating since September, when Tigray held regional elections which the federal government called illegal. In recent days, both sides accused each other of plotting a military conflict.
Sources said efforts were under way behind the scenes to encourage talks, pushed by the African Union. But the initiative was being resisted by the government which insists it has to eliminate a threat posed by the TPLF.
""The Ethiopians are saying it is an internal matter and they will handle it. They are saying it (TPLF) is a rogue element within their border and this is about the rule of law,"" said a diplomatic source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Redwan Hussein, spokesman for a newly-established State of Emergency Task Force, told Reuters on Wednesday that the option for talks was not yet on the table.
Dozens of federal troops were killed during the first day of fighting, one diplomat told Reuters, adding that the death toll could be higher. There was no word on casualties suffered by the TPLF. The government has cut all phone and internet communication in the region.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to back Abiy in a tweet, which urged immediate action to restore peace and de-escalate the situation, while backing the government account that the TPLF was responsible for violence.
""We are deeply concerned by reports that the Tigray People's Liberation Front carried out attacks on Ethiopian National Defense Force bases in Ethiopia's Tigray region,"" Pompeo wrote.

Ethiopia has suffered multiple outbreaks of violence since Abiy took office. At the weekend, gunmen killed 32 people and torched more than 20 houses in another part of the country, in the west.

Seven defendants were sentenced to five years in prison, while 29 were acquitted. 
The sit-in continued for weeks at Rabaa al-Adawiya square in Cairo to protest against the overthrow of former president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, before being violently broken up by security forces. 
The government says many protesters were armed, and that some members of the security forces were killed. Those sentenced were accused of organising and participating in an armed gathering, among other charges.
Mursi's ouster was led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the then army chief who was elected president in 2014.
Rights groups have strongly criticised Egypt for convicting people for participating in the sit-in and for sentencing suspects in mass trials, including one case in which 75 people were sentenced to death and more than 600 handed jail sentences in 2018.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",A crushed student movement and shrinking hope ahead of Myanmar's election,"By Thu Thu Aung and Poppy McPherson
YANGON/LONDON (Reuters) - Myanmar teacher Hnin grew up idolizing Aung San Suu Kyi, the one-time democracy icon who now leads her country. But when voters go to the polls on Sunday for the second general election since the end of military rule, Hnin will not back her.
While Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) is expected to win again on the strength of its leader's enduring popularity, critics such as Hnin say she has failed to make good on promises to unite the country.
""I have no more trust in her,"" said the 21-year-old of the Nobel peace prize laureate. ""The path she is trying to take towards democracy is impossible.""
Far from the wave of optimism that greeted the NLD's landslide win in 2015, Myanmar goes into this election facing a surging coronavirus outbreak, rising economic hardship and escalating civil and ethnic conflicts.
Hnin is one of dozens of activists from a student group behind anti-government protests and leaflet campaigns across the country in recent months.
The All Burma Federation of Students Union (ABFSU), which urges a boycott of the vote, are a fringe group at the sharp edge of deepening disillusionment in parts of the country.
Their campaign has been met with a sharp crackdown. Nine have been sentenced, two of them to five years in prison, for causing public mischief among other charges, while 10 others are in police custody and more than a dozen are in hiding.
Representatives of the NLD and government did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment.
Suu Kyi's defenders say the students are unrealistic to expect rapid change after half a century of military rule and are hampering efforts to secure gradual progress.
""Everyone is trying so hard to expel the dictatorship,"" said Buddhist monk Thawbita. ""They are making problems. It is definitely not acceptable.""
'BETTER FUTURE'
The ABFSU began a ""no more war"" campaign in March, with students putting up posters and handing out leaflets condemning the war in Rakhine state.
Rakhine is the region bordering Bangladesh from which more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims were expelled in 2017 after a military crackdown the United Nations has said was executed with ""genocidal intent"". Myanmar denies accusations of genocide during what it says was a legitimate counterinsurgency campaign.
Now Rakhine is the site of another conflict between government troops and the Arakan Army, an ethnic armed group that recruits from the mostly Buddhist local majority in its quest for greater state autonomy.
The army has denied targeting civilians in the latest conflict, which has killed dozens and displaced tens of thousands, and declared the Arakan Army a terrorist organisation.
In cities and towns across the country, the students have distributed pamphlets and put up posters with slogans like ""dictatorships must fail"" and ""oppose murderous fascism"" and urging the government to lift curbs on the internet in Rakhine.
Hnin said she sympathized with the victims of the war because she grew up in the northern Kachin state, which has also been ravaged by insurgency.
The civilian government had done nothing to stop the conflict and was a ""puppet"" of the army, she said, blaming the junta-drafted 2008 constitution that reserves key powers for the military and gives it a veto over changes to the charter.
""As a teacher, I want a better future for the children,"" Hnin said. ""With this constitution, nothing will happen.""
'DEEP FREEZE'
Maya Tudor, a lecturer at the Blavnik School of Government at Oxford University who studies democratic transition, said the NLD had failed to make democratic changes within its power, maintaining tight curbs on the media and prosecuting critics.
""The promise of an NLD-led democratic deepening has evaporated amid backsliding,"" she said. ""The transition is in deep-freeze.""
Government ministers have said expectations on what the NLD could achieve in its first term were unrealistically high, but that the administration has revoked some oppressive junta-era legislation and plans further reform. 
Interest in politics has fallen since 2015, however, with pessimism highest in ethnic areas where many people feel sidelined by the Buddhist Bamar majority government, according to a survey by local watchdog the People's Alliance for Credible Elections.
Ethnic-based parties are expected to pull some votes away from the NLD. 
But internal migration and a first-past-the-post electoral system means this may not translate into seats, analysts say, and elections have been cancelled in more than 50 townships due to insurgencies.
Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based analyst with the International Crisis Group, said in 2015 many ethnic minorities saw Suu Kyi's party as natural allies.
""But they have now come to see the NLD as an adversary, governing in the interests of the majority,"" he said. ""This could drive more armed conflict.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - An oversight panel called on Thursday for reforms at the World Health Organization (WHO) including ""predictable and flexible"" funding and setting up a multi-tiered system to warn countries earlier about disease outbreaks before they escalate.
The independent experts said it was essential to preserve the U.N. agency's ""neutrality and political independence"" in tackling outbreaks, but did not refer directly to China or the United States.
""It will be necessary for the organization to undertake yet further reform to allow it to become the guardian of global public health. This, then, must be seen as a defining moment for global community health,"" they said in a report.
The WHO has led the global response to the novel coronavirus pandemic that has infected 48 million people and killed more than 1.2 million since it emerged in China late last year.
The Trump administration has accused the organization of being a ""puppet of China"" and decried an ""apparent attempt to conceal"" the outbreak. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has denied this and said it ""sounded the alarm early and often"".
The oversight panel chaired by Felicity Harvey is due to report to WHO's annual ministerial meeting that resumes virtually on Monday after a shortened session last May. 
Reuters reported in March that the WHO was considering changing the way it classifies and describes international epidemics. 
Its current one-level system relies on declaring a PHEIC, or a public health emergency of international concern, but there have been calls for a more graded approach to capture different levels of severity. 
The experts called for ""a graded system with clear criteria ... to make it possible to alert and engage the wider international community at an earlier stage in a health crisis"".
They found a ""significant discrepancy between member states’ financial contributions and their expectations"" of WHO's Emergency Programme. Set up in 2016, the programme has some 1,000 staff with another 500 jobs vacant due to shortfalls. 

""The result is a constant struggle to mobilize resources, with staff forced to juggle competing priorities simultaneously,"" the report said.

The bill, published on a government website, is one of several being introduced following constitutional reforms that, among other things, allow President Vladimir Putin to run again when his term ends in 2024.
The draft legislation is being carefully parsed for clues as to what Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for more than two decades, plans to do in 2024. 
Former presidents already enjoy lifetime immunity for crimes committed in office under legislation adopted after Russia's first post-Soviet president, Boris Yeltsin, handed the reins of power to Putin at the turn of the century. 
The new bill would also make it harder to revoke ex-presidents' expanded immunity. 
It would require the upper house of parliament to vote overwhelmingly to revoke it on the strength of accusations by the lower house that the president had committed treason or another serious crime. 

The bill will become law if the lower house votes to approve it in three readings, the upper house backs it, and Putin then signs it.

JORDAN VALLEY, West Bank (Reuters) - Israel has demolished most of a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank, displacing 73 Palestinians - including 41 children - in the largest such demolition in years, residents and a United Nations official said.
Tented homes, animal shelters, latrines and solar panels were among the structures destroyed in the village of Khirbet Humsah on Tuesday, according to the U.N. official.
Israel's military liaison agency with the Palestinians, COGAT, confirmed that a demolition had been carried out against what it said were illegal structures.
By Thursday morning the residents had already moved back to the site, using tents donated by Palestinian aid groups, according to a Reuters witness.
The remains of the demolished village lay across the hillsides, with just two of the original homes still standing some distance from the others.
""They want to expel us from the area so that settlers can live in our place, but we will not leave from here,"" said resident Harbi Abu Kabsh, referring to the roughly 430,000 Israeli settlers who live alongside three million Palestinians in the West Bank, which Israel captured in a 1967 war.
COGAT on Wednesday issued a statement saying that an ""enforcement activity"" had been carried out by Israeli forces ""against 7 tents and 8 pens which were illegally constructed, in a firing range located in the Jordan Valley.""
Israel often cites a lack of building permits in demolishing Palestinian structures in the West Bank.
Yvonne Helle, a humanitarian coordinator for the United Nations in the Palestinian territories, said that relief agencies had visited Khirbet Humsah and recorded 76 demolished structures, ""more than in any other single demolition in the past decade"".
Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said the structures included 18 tents and sheds.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh accused Israel of timing the demolition for election day in the United States, when the world was distracted.
He wrote on Twitter: ""As the attention is focused on #USElection2020, Israel chose this evening to commit another crime/ cover it up: to demolish 70 Palestinian structures, incl. homes.""
A COGAT spokesman on Thursday had no immediate comment on Shtayyeh's claim. But its statement on Wednesday said: ""The enforcement was carried out in accordance with the authorities and procedures, and subject to operational considerations.""

Some 689 structures have been demolished across the West Bank and East Jerusalem so far this year, leaving 869 Palestinians homeless, according to the United Nations.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A long-awaited Vatican report into disgraced ex-U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick is expected to be released this month to coincide with an annual meeting of American bishops, Vatican sources said on Thursday.
McCarrick was expelled from the Roman Catholic priesthood last year after a Vatican investigation found him guilty of sexual crimes against minors and adults and abuse of power.
Pope Francis ordered a thorough study of all documents in Holy See offices concerning McCarrick in 2018. The four U.S. dioceses where he served - New York, Metuchen, Newark, and Washington, D.C. - carried out separate investigations to feed into the Vatican report.
U.S. Catholic bishops are due to hold their annual meeting Nov. 15-19. It will be held virtually this year because of the coronavirus.
The sources said the report would be released by the Vatican before the bishops' meeting starts. 
There is great anticipation for the report because it may show how McCarrick managed to rise through the ranks even though his history of sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians was an open secret.

The 90-year-old McCarrick, once a power-broker as Archbishop of Washington, D.C. from 2001 to 2006, is the highest-profile Church figure to have been dismissed from the priesthood in modern times.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - A court sent the lead anchor of India's fiercely nationalist and popular Republic television network to jail for 14 days for allegedly abetting a suicide in a case the channel blamed on local politicians angered by its news coverage.
Police picked up Arnab Goswami, an aggressive journalist known for championing right-wing causes in his prime time debates, from his Mumbai home early on Wednesday, touching off furious debate over whether the press was being muzzled.
Top leaders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sprang to Goswami's defence and said it was no way to treat the press, blaming opposition politicians who run the government in western Maharashtra state, where Mumbai is located.
But the BJP has faced criticism that it has sought to intimidate journalists and activists in states that it governs. Critics said its defence of free speech was selective and that Goswami was an conservative ally of the ruling party. 
""Arnab was to the BJP what Fox was to Trump in the U.S.,"" Girish Kuber, the editor of the Loksatta newspaper said, referring to U.S.-based Fox News network whose opinion hosts are usually supportive of President Donald Trump.
""No party in India can claim to speak for true freedom of expression and speech,"" Kuber said.
Police said the case against Goswami related to the 2018 suicide of an interior decorator who allegedly left a note saying Republic TV had not paid him for design work on its television studio.
A case of abetment to suicide that was registered against Goswami following the suicide was later closed for lack of evidence. But police said they had re-opened the case and late on Wednesday night a district court ordered him to custody.
Republic TV denied the allegation and said 90% of the amount owed to the designer had been paid two years ago. The arrest of Goswami was an ""act of revenge and vengeance for his news coverage which questioned those in power in the state of Maharashtra,"" it said.
Police did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations.
Anil Deshmukh, the state's home or interior minister, said on Wednesday: ""No one is above the law and Maharashtra police will take necessary action as per the law"".

Republic TV denied the allegation and said 90% of the amount owed to the designer had been paid two years ago. The arrest of Goswami was an ""act of revenge and vengeance for his news coverage which questioned those in power in the state of Maharashtra,"" it said.
Police did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations.
Anil Deshmukh, the state's home or interior minister, said on Wednesday: ""No one is above the law and Maharashtra police will take necessary action as per the law"".

""I've chosen to take drastic measures sooner rather than later,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.
Under the new countrywide restrictions to take effect from Saturday, retail businesses will be shut with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. Civilians will need a time-slot permit to venture outdoors.
Primary schools will stay open, but high schools will shut.
The country has reported fewer cases than most in Europe, mainly due to an early nationwide lockdown that it imposed when the pandemic broke out in February. It started unwinding those restrictions in May. 
Since early October it has seen a surge in infections and has been reimposing curbs. The resurgence was ""particularly aggressive"", chief government scientific adviser Sotiris Tsiodras said, speaking alongside Mitsotakis. 

Greece registered 2,646 infections on Wednesday, the highest daily tally since its first case surfaced, bringing the total number of cases to 46,892. So far, 673 people have died of the disease.

Hidalgo said this would entail shutting down certain shops selling takeaway food and drink at 10 p.m. local time, which would come on top of the existing national lockdown that has been imposed throughout France.
President Emmanuel Macron imposed a new lockdown last month, forcing non-essential shops - such as those not selling basic foods or medicines - to close, and making people use signed documents to justify being out on the streets.
Nevertheless, French authorities believed more measures were needed in Paris as they felt there were still too many people out in the capital late at night, in spite of the lockdown.
New COVID-19 lockdowns and curbs have stirred resistance across Europe even as countries including France and Spain deal with record daily infections and hospitals under pressure.
A French government source told Reuters this week that they had noted in Paris ""clandestine parties, raves, private dinners"", and felt stricter measures were needed. 
""When you get people who are not playing by the rules of the game, and are therefore putting at risk the health of a large number of people, that is when you need to put in place new restrictions,"" Hidalgo said.

On Wednesday, France reported 40,558 new COVID-19 cases and a further 385 deaths, taking the country's total death toll from COVID to 38,674 while the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases stands at around 1.5 million.

THULASENDRAPURAM, India (Reuters) - Villagers in the Indian ancestral home of Kamala Harris painted slogans on roads wishing her victory on Thursday, as Joe Biden, her Democrat running mate in the U.S. presidential election, moved closer to the White House.
Thulasendrapuram, located about 320 km (200 miles) south of Chennai, is where Harris's maternal grandfather was born more than a century ago.
""From yesterday, we are excited about the final result,"" said Abirami, a resident of the village. ""Now, we are hearing positive news. We are waiting to celebrate her victory.""
Many of her neighbours watched updates from the count on their mobile phones. 
The lush, green village in the south of the country has also been decked out in posters of Harris, with prayers offered at the local Hindu temple. 
Biden leads the count and has predicted he will win but closely contested states - including Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - were still tallying votes, leaving the election outcome uncertain. [L1N2HR0BX]
Harris’s grandfather P.V. Gopalan and his family moved to Chennai nearly 90 years ago. He retired there as a high-ranking government official.

Harris, who was born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father who both immigrated to the United States to study, visited Thulasendrapuram when she was five and has repeatedly recalled walks with her grandfather on the beaches of Chennai.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's top diplomat plans to visit Washington next week, officials said on Thursday, as Seoul pledged a solid alliance with the United States regardless of the presidential election results. 
Democratic challenger Joe Biden predicted victory on Wednesday after winning two key U.S. states, while President Donald Trump alleged fraud, filed lawsuits and demanded recounts in a race yet to be decided a day after polls closed.
South Korea's foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha will arrive in Washington on Sunday for a four day stay, the ministry said. 
The trip came at the invitation from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who cancelled his planned visit to Seoul last month after Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. 
The ministers will hold a meeting over bilateral and regional issues including stalled talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for U.S. sanctions relief. 
Despite uncertainty over the U.S. election, South Korea's presidential Blue House said it would maintain the ""solid"" alliance whoever wins the White House. 
""Regardless of the election outcome, our government will not only maintain the solid alliance with the United States but also continue cooperation to develop it further,"" Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok told a briefing. 
""We will also actively cooperate with a new administration to achieve the goal of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and building a peace regime, and closely communicate in line with the traditions that the two countries have worked together with any governments from each other.""
The Blue House was cautiously monitoring the U.S. election, with President Moon Jae-in scheduled for no public activity on Thursday. The presidential National Security Council was set to gather at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) to discuss developments, Kang said.

Of the roughly 1,000 tonnes that spilled from the Panamanian-flagged MV Wakashio, all of the oil that had been floating in the ocean had been recovered, Nagashiki Shipping said in a statement.
Work to remove the oil along approximately 30 km (18.6 miles) of coastline was proceeding smoothly and would likely be completed by January, it said.
The vessel, chartered by Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd, ran aground on a reef in Mauritius on July 25 and began leaking oil on Aug. 6.
The spilt oil had spread over a vast area of endangered corals, affecting fish and other marine life in what some scientists have called the Indian Ocean island's worst ecological disaster.

Nagashiki Shipping also said the planned removal of the rear portion of the vessel would begin in late December and last several months. The front part was scuttled in August as instructed by local authorities.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean man who crossed the heavily fortified border with South Korea has said he wants to defect to the South, Seoul officials said on Thursday.
The man was taken into custody in the Demilitarised Zone separating the two Koreas on Wednesday, several hours after he was spotted crossing barbed wire fences installed along the border, prompting an urgent search operation.
Authorities have launched an investigation into how the man managed to cross the frontier, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.
""I understand the person has expressed his willingness to defect,"" JCS spokesman Kim Joon-rak told a briefing, declining to provide further detail during the ongoing investigation.
Kim said border controls were being further examined after the search for the man revealed that some parts of the fences equipped with electronic monitoring systems were found to have been damaged, possibly by typhoons.
There was no unusual movement from North Korean troops, Kim added.
The defection cames just as Seoul reopens tours to the southern part of the DMZ, which has seen several armed clashes but also served as a venue for key inter-Korean events, including some of the most recent summits.
The tours had been suspended in October 2019 after an outbreak of deadly African swine fever broke out in North Korea, and then due to concerns about the novel coronavirus this year.
This week's DMZ crossing is the first since a North Korean soldier defected to the South in 2019. Another soldier crossed in 2018, and in a more dramatic 2017 incident, North Korean troops fired at a soldier when he drove an army truck through the DMZ.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Jose Manuel Maranillo, a Cuban asylum seeker stranded in Mexico by Republican President Donald Trump's immigration policies, was distraught when learned his brother-in-law in Florida had voted for him.
""Imagine it!"" he exclaimed on Wednesday while working as a fruit and vegetable vendor in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez.
""I'm a part of his family! I feel terrible he voted for Trump because we're stuck here in Juarez hoping for (Joe) Biden to win so he can help us and Latinos in the United States too,"" he said. 
On Tuesday, a wave of support from the large Cuban-American community helped Trump to a narrow but decisive victory in key battleground state Florida.
But Cuban asylum seekers stranded in Mexico under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies are praying that Democrat Biden wins nationally - and more than a half dozen Cubans told Reuters they're upset, although altogether not surprised, that their family members and compatriots bolstered Trump in a critical swing state.
""They're only thinking about the benefits for themselves if Trump wins, and nothing else,"" said Dairon Elisondo, a Cuban doctor and asylum seeker who works in a refugee camp in Matamoros, Mexico, just across the river from Brownsville, Texas.
Elisondo said that he opposes the Cuban government just like his fellow Cubans in Miami. But he said Trump's aggressive stance against Havana shouldn't outweigh the sum of his other policies, including the anti-asylum programs that have forced thousands of Latin Americans seeking U.S. refuge to wait out the process in Mexico, instead of in the United States.
""It's true the Trump administration has pushed the Cuban government up against the wall and for that Cubans are supporting him, but we can't consider only this one issue and ignore the hundreds of bad things he's done,"" said Elisondo, who said he's disappointed in his Cuban friends who voted for Trump.
Republican party officials and political analysts say the Trump campaign's effort to cast Biden as a socialist, combined with the Trump administration's hardline policies on the Cuban government, appealed to Cuban and Cuban-American voters.
""In my case, it's about what my family went through (in Cuba) and what we lost,"" said Cuban American Denise Galvez, co-founder of Latinas for Trump and based in Florida.
She said immigration was far from a top voting issue for her and fellow Cubans in the state.
""The priority became 'we've got to save our democracy,'"" she said.
Another Cuban-American Trump supporter in Florida, Maria Romero, said Trump's posture toward Havana won her vote, although she feels for the plight of her compatriots.
""I'm Cuban, so I don't want him to be kicking other Cubans in the head,"" she said. 
But back in Mexico, that's exactly what the Florida results felt like to some asylum seekers.
""With so many Cubans stranded here in Mexico, with the violence, with everything - it's just something I can't understand,"" said Ludmina Cabello Gonzalez, a Cuban asylum seeker who works in a butcher shop in Ciudad Juarez. 
Yuri Gonzalez, who has spent more than a year in Mexico waiting for his asylum claims to be processed in a U.S. court, said that shifts in the United States' migratory policies towards Cubans have opened up a sharp divide between those who immigrated in a more welcoming era and those stranded in Mexico today.
""Many of them [in Florida] arrived to the United States on planes with visas,"" he said.
In contrast, Gonzalez said, he and his wife fled Cuba to Brazil and have traveled thousands of miles across the continent just to reach the U.S. border.

""They didn't cross borders or endure any of the difficult experiences I've had to,"" he said. ""And those who did, the ones who were attacked and extorted, now they've forgotten it.""

According to the ministry, Marant's latest collection, including a long cape with stripes and starburst designs in gray and brown hues, includes elements from the Purepecha people of Mexico's Michoacan state.
""I ask you, Ms. Isabel Marant, to publicly explain on what grounds you privatize a collective property ... and how its use benefits the creator communities,"" Culture Minister Alejandra Frausto said in a letter to the designer.
""Some symbols that you took have a deep meaning for this culture,"" Frausto said, urging protection for the artisans who have historically been ""invisible.""

VIENNA (Reuters) - Large quantities of mobile phone footage have confirmed that the jihadist who killed four people in a rampage in Vienna on Monday was the only gunman, but Austria fumbled intelligence on him, Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said on Wednesday.
Austria arrested 14 people aged 18 to 28 on Tuesday in connection with the attack and is investigating them on suspicion of belonging to a terrorist organisation, he said. But it would also have to investigate its own actions, he added.
""Before the terror attack began, according to the information currently available, some things also went wrong,"" Nehammer told a news conference. 
In July, neighbouring Slovakia's intelligence service had handed over information suggesting the attacker had tried and failed to buy ammunition there, Nehammer and a top ministry official, Director General for Public Security Franz Ruf, said.
""In the next steps evidently something went wrong here with communications,"" said Nehammer, who called for the formation of an independent commission to examine the errors made.
After receiving the tip-off from Slovakia, Austria's domestic intelligence agencies at the federal and provincial level made the necessary checks and sent questions back to Bratislava, Ruf said.
""It's up to the commission to clarify whether the process went optimally and in line with the law,"" he said, when pressed on what had gone wrong. Austria's National Security Council signed off on setting up the commission later on Wednesday.
The gunman, who was shot dead by police within minutes of opening fire, was a 20-year-old with dual Austrian and North Macedonian citizenship. Born and raised in Vienna, he had already been convicted of trying to reach Syria to join Islamic State and had spent time in jail.
All of those arrested in Austria have a ""migration background"", Nehammer said. Vienna police chief Gerhard Puerstl added that some were dual citizens of Bangladesh, North Macedonia, Turkey or Russia.
Neutral Austria, part of the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS formed in 2014, has for years seen jihadist attacks as its biggest security threat and warned of the danger posed by foreign fighters returning from Iraq or Syria or their admirers.
At the end of 2018, the authorities knew of 320 people from Austria who were actively involved or had wanted to participate in jihad in Syria and Iraq. Of these, around 58 people were thought to have died in the region and 93 to have returned to Austria. Another 62 were prevented from leaving the country.
Nehammer repeated criticism of a deradicalisation programme, saying the gunman had ""perfectly"" fooled the programme to reintegrate jihadists into society. 
But Moussa Al-Hassan Diaw, a co-founder of Derad, the organisation that runs the programme, rejected Nehammer's assertion, telling Reuters: ""It was always clear that this person was in no way deradicalised.""
LONE GUNMAN
Members of the public had handed in more than 20,000 mobile phone videos that the authorities analyzed before coming to the conclusion that there was only one gunman, Nehammer said, putting an end to lingering confusion on that point.
Switzerland has also arrested two men in connection with the attack. Its justice minister said the two were ""obviously friends"" with the gunman.
Ruf said Austria was in contact with Switzerland and another country that he declined to identify over the investigation.
North Macedonia said on Tuesday three people were somehow involved in the attack and all had dual Austrian and North Macedonian citizenship. It identified them only by initials.
On Wednesday afternoon Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's office said President Emmanuel Macron of France, which has suffered two deadly attacks recently amid Islamist anger over the publication of satirical caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad, would visit Vienna on Monday.

Six hours later, it said the meeting was postponed ""because of the COVID-19 situation in Europe"", adding: ""instead, a video conference will take place at the beginning of the week on the fight against Islamic terrorism and political Islam.""

President Alassane Ouattara won the election with 94% of the vote, according to the electoral commission.
However, the opposition has boycotted the vote, arguing Ouattara's bid for a third term broke a legal two-term limit and undermined the country's democratic process.
Police in riot gear surrounded the houses of two of Ouattara's main rivals on Wednesday after the government accused them of sedition for creating a parallel administration in defiance of Saturday's victory declaration.
The standoff has raised concerns about instability in the world's top cocoa producer, where a civil war killed 3,000 people in 2010-11 following a disputed election between Ouattara and his predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo.
This election season, over 40 people have died in clashes.
Guillaume Soro, who led the rebels that swept Ouattara to power during that war, but whose relationship with the president has since soured, released a message on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday night calling on the army to join the opposition government.
""Turning now to our security and Defence forces … I'm asking you to disobey illegal orders and join the national transitional council,"" he said. ""We cannot, out of fear, allow dictatorship in Ivory Coast by Alassane Ouattara.""
It was unclear if there was any reaction to the statement late on Wednesday, but it added to tensions that many fear could help destabilise a region beset by political unrest. 
In neighbouring Guinea, a similar election crisis in which President Alpha Conde won a third term last month caused rioting in which dozens have died.
Guinea also has a two-term limit but like Ouattara, Conde said a recent change to the constitution allowed him to restart his mandate.

MANAGUA/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Storm Eta pummeled Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rain on Wednesday after triggering major floods and landslides in Central America, reportedly killing at least three people and stranding dozens of fishermen in the Atlantic.
Eta, one of the most powerful storms to strike Central America in years, hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, before weakening to a tropical storm as it forged inland in the impoverished country.
After losing more strength over Central America, Eta is forecast to return to the sea and regain momentum as a tropical storm, charting a course to Cuba and southern Florida this weekend, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
In its wake, the storm has left a whole swathe of damaged homes, roads and key infrastructure, while thousands of people have been evacuated.
About 60 fishermen were trapped out at sea in the eastern Mosquitia region of Honduras, possibly taking shelter on Caribbean keys, said Robin Morales, a representative of the local population. 
A boat was sent on Wednesday to collect the body of one fishermen, who died from a heart attack, but the Navy will be needed to rescue others, Morales said.
So far, the Navy has not been able to attempt a rescue due to the dangerous conditions, said Douglas Espinal, head of the fire department in the port of Puerto Lempira.
The deluge was so extreme in the northern Honduran city of El Progreso that a prison was flooded to waist level, a wall collapsed and the facility's 604 inmates were transferred to local gyms, police commissioner Juan Molina told local television.
The storm weakened in intensity around noon on Wednesday but it continued to produce ""life-threatening flash flooding"" in parts of Central America, the NHC said.
Nicaraguan media reported that two wildcat miners were killed by a mudslide. In Honduras, a 13-year-old girl died in a landslide on her home, the fire department said
By 12 noon local time, Eta was blowing winds of 45 miles mph (72 kph), the NHC said. It was grinding through Nicaragua about 125 miles (201 km) north-northeast of Nicaragua's capital Managua, moving westward at 7 mph (11 kph).
Eta could dump 10-20 inches (25-51 cm) of rain on central and northern Nicaragua and much of Honduras, with up to 40 inches in some areas, according to the latest NHC forecasts.
The storm knocked down trees and power lines and caused serious flooding in northern Nicaragua, national disaster management agency SINAPRED said Tuesday. Still, Vice President Rosario Murillo said the initial damage was less than feared.
In Honduras, rivers burst their banks, towns and cities on the Atlantic coast flooded, and landslides hit roads.
In Guatemala, the rains felled trees and unleashed landslides onto roads, authorities said.
Through Sunday, flash and river flooding is also possible across Jamaica, southeast Mexico, El Salvador, southern Haiti, and the Cayman Islands, NHC said.
The storm is forecast to advance further into Honduras on Wednesday before barreling over Belize and back out into the Caribbean over Cuba and Florida, the NHC said.

Eta is the 28th named tropical storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, tying a record set in 2005, the NHC said.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 05:26PM ET</span>","In Venezuela, many hope Trump will win to keep pressure on Maduro","By Vivian Sequera
CARACAS (Reuters) - Many Venezuelans are hoping for the re-election of U.S. President Donald Trump, whose campaign of aggressive sanctions against the South American nation's ruling Socialist Party has won over a broad swathe of President Nicolas Maduro's critics. 
The Trump administration has promised that sanctions will cause the ouster of Maduro, who has overseen a catastrophic economic meltdown that fueled a mass exodus of migrants. 
But the strategy has after nearly two years failed to shake him from power, and critics say the measures have exacerbated the once-prosperous OPEC member's humanitarian crisis by hurting the government's cash flow and complicating imports of critical goods like gasoline.
Despite Democratic candidate Joe Biden's promises not to soften measures against Maduro, some Venezuelans believe he will take a less confrontational approach similar to that of former President Barack Obama.
Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido hopes the United States will continue to pressure Maduro, regardless of whether Trump or Biden is declared the winner, Tomas Guanipa, Guaido's representative in Colombia, said in the capital Bogota. 
""What we hope for is continuity of a policy that has so far been bipartisan, which has supported the struggle for democracy in Venezuela, which has supported the interim government of President Juan Guaido, which has supported the National Assembly as the only legitimate democratic institution,"" Guanipa told reporters in Bogota's historic Bolivar Plaza.
On a commercial street in middle-class eastern Caracas on Wednesday morning, where workers in fraying shirts and home-sewn face masks strolled up and down the streets, many people were convinced Trump would win. 
""Trump wins because he has stood up to these shameless people here in Venezuela, to Maduro,"" said Jose Gregorio Bastidas, 56, a construction worker from the poor hillside barrio of Petare.
""Many people talk about 'the blockade.' The blockade is on the credit cards of Maduro's ministers,"" he said, in reference to Maduro's accusations that the sanctions are the cause of Venezuela's economic problems.
Maduro's supporters almost universally condemn Trump while also expressing skepticism toward Biden, insisting that the U.S. policy is meant to undermine Venezuela's democracy. 
And some of Maduro's most vocal adversaries openly criticize sanctions on the grounds that they have worsened living conditions without yielding a change in government.
U.S. policy toward Venezuela was widely discussed on the campaign trail in Florida, particularly in Miami-Dade County, home to the state's largest Venezuelan community - helping Trump win a narrow victory in Florida.
The election's results hung in the balance on Wednesday, with a handful of closely contested states set to decide the outcome in the coming hours or days.
The sanctions against Maduro's government have included asset freezes and travel bans for senior officials, and measures to curtail the OPEC nation's oil exports and its fuel imports.
That has left millions of people in long lines waiting to fuel their cars or struggling to find public transportation.
Some Venezuelans nonetheless feel that Trump is the first U.S. leader to confront Maduro's government, which has been accused of systematic human rights violations and extensive efforts to undermine democratic institutions.

""I would like Trump to win because I think he is the one who has implemented the most measures to solve the problem here,"" said Fernando Gonzalez, 59, an information technology analyst.

In the critically affected red zones people will only be allowed to leave their homes for work, health reasons or emergencies and bars, restaurants and most shops will be closed.
High school classes and those for the final two years of middle school will be moved online. 
However, unlike Italy's national lockdown in the spring, all factories will remain open.
""Our intensive care capacity could be exhausted in a matter of weeks, we have to intervene,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at a news conference to illustrate the package which comes into effect on Friday.
Conte said the red zones would comprise the large northern regions of Lombardy and neighbouring Piedmont, along with Calabria in Italy's southern toe and the tiny alpine region of Valle D'Aosta.
Lombardy accounts for around a sixth of Italy's population and more than a fifth of its gross domestic product.
The orange regions, where shops will remain open and people can move freely within their towns and cities but not leave them, are Puglia in Italy's heel and the island of Sicily.
The rest of the country's 20 regions, including Lazio around the capital Rome, will be yellow, meaning there are no restrictions other than those imposed nationwide. 
Italy saw 352 COVID-related deaths on Wednesday after registering 353 the day before, the health ministry reported earlier, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 30,550 from 28,244.
Under the nationwide restrictions regardless of zoning, restaurants and bars must close at 6 p.m., cinemas, restaurants, museums and gyms are all closed and shopping centres are closed at weekends.

All high school classes are to be held online, while younger children will still be allowed to attend school in person.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Ivory Coast opposition leaders refused to disband their breakaway government on Wednesday despite being put under effective house arrest following a disputed presidential election.
The country and its neighbour Guinea are experiencing parallel post-election crises after their presidents both decided to run for a controversial third term in office, prompting fears of prolonged instability.
The moves could spook investors and undermine democracy in a region where Islamist groups exploit discord to win recruits, analysts say. 
The opposition in Ivory Coast boycotted Saturday's election and announced a rival administration after President Alassane Ouattara was declared the landslide winner. On Tuesday night police in riot gear took up positions around the homes of key opposition leaders, preventing them from leaving.
""Let's stay mobilized for the love of a reconciled Ivory Coast ... and against this autocratic regime which has flouted the Constitution,"" opposition leader and former president Henri Konan Bedie tweeted from his surrounded house on Wednesday.
In Guinea, dozens of people have been killed in skirmishes between security forces and protesters in the lead-up to and after the Oct. 18 election that gave President Alpha Conde an overwhelming victory. The opposition has called for more protests and challenged the results in court.
Analysts say neither result is likely to be overturned but that the standoffs could escalate in a region that has struggled to make strides towards multi-party democracy since the 1990s.
The U.S. embassy in Ivory Coast condemned the violence surrounding the election and called for calm and dialogue between the parties in a statement on Wednesday.
France's foreign ministry is aware of the announcement of Ouattara's provisional victory, a spokesperson said on Wednesday, but condemned the ""serious violence"" and ""acts of intimidation"" that have taken place.
At least 40 people have been killed before, during and after the vote, in violence that has sparked fears of a repeat of 2010 when a disputed election won by Ouattara led to a brief civil war which killed 3,000 people.
The country has a two-term limit for the presidency, as does Guinea, the top bauxite producer and home to one of the world's largest untapped iron ore deposits. But both presidents said recent constitutional changes had reset their mandates.
""The confines placed on West African leaders have been bent and we have seen a regression in democratic standards,"" said Eric Humphery-Smith, analyst at British-based risk consultancy Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft. ""It is something to be worried about.""
TEAR GAS, MACHETE ATTACKS
In a sign of potential skirmishes to come in Ivory Coast, riot police fired tear gas at opposition supporters outside the homes of the opposition leaders on Tuesday after the government accused them of sedition.
In the centre of the country, where politics is frequently split along ethnic lines, local officials have confirmed post-election machete attacks, reviving memories of the civil war.
The convoy of Communications Minister Sidi Toure came under gunfire on Tuesday night in a central region, killing a member of his entourage, two government sources said. 
Farmers in the cocoa belt have been afraid to tend their crops at the start of the season for fear of violence, they said, raising the risk of disease and rot. Middlemen said they are not going into the bush to buy, which could ultimately slow exports.
""Even fairly low-level police action ... will probably cause some casualties and tend to have a negative impact on investors’ perceptions of risk,"" said South Africa-based risk consultancy firm NKC African Economics. 
In Guinea, the country's biggest bauxite exporter, Société Minière de Boké (SMB), has seen some impact from the unrest, though losses have been limited, said managing director Frédéric Bouzigues, without elaborating.

""For mining companies, it is absolutely fundamental to promote a climate of peace and stability which allows us to work in peace,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers approved a month-long lockdown in England, voting on Wednesday in favour of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to try to prevent COVID-19 running out of control and overwhelming health services.
People will be ordered to stay at home from 0001 GMT on Thursday to combat a surge in new infections that could, if unchecked, cause more deaths than a first wave which forced a three-month lockdown earlier this year.
The 516-38 vote had been in little doubt after the opposition Labour Party said they would support the move, even though they criticised Johnson for acting too slowly. He was also criticised by some in his own party who said a national lockdown was too severe.
""None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops, to furlough their staff or stay away from their friends and family,"" Johnson told parliament in an attempt to calm rebels within his Conservative Party. 
The United Kingdom, which has the biggest official death toll in Europe from COVID-19, is grappling with more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day and scientists have warned the ""worst case"" scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded.
Those warnings forced Johnson to announce a U-turn on Saturday, having previously insisted on an approach of regional lockdowns.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""While these regulations are not in any way desirable or perfect, they are now necessary because the government has lost control of the virus.""
Some in Johnson's own party, however, voted against the plan. 
""I have a fundamental problem with much of what we're being asked to do here - as well as the economic impact, the human toll which this will have,"" said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Brady (NYSE:BRC), head of an influential Conservative committee.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 10:46AM ET</span>","In wake of attacks, one French Muslim asks: does my country love me?","By Elizabeth Pineau
ARGENTEUIL, France (Reuters) - Naouelle Garnoussi is a devout Muslim who was brought up in France, prays five times a day, enjoys her job working with local communities and covets her designer handbag.
Raised by her grandparents - one Muslim, the other Catholic - the 36-year-old identifies as French, and defends France's secular values that separate religion from the state in public life.
Yet in the aftermath of a spate of Islamist attacks she has begun to feel increasingly alienated in her own country.
Compatriots tend to see her as a Muslim first, she said, and the government's response to the violence left her wondering: are Muslims really equal in the eyes of the Republic?
""My grandmother was French. My great-grandmother was French, she was called Antoinette. You don't get more French than that, but sometimes I'm made to feel I am no longer French, just a Muslim,"" Garnoussi told Reuters in her flat in Argenteuil, a working-class Paris suburb.
Attitudes among members of the public towards Muslims appeared to be hardening, she continued.
""Sometimes I forget to put my phone on silent and the call to prayer rings out. The other day I was spat on (when that happened), so it's starting to get really bad.""
Some prominent Muslim figures fear the wider public is tarring them with the same brush as militants.
This week, a statement from a group of Muslim leaders pressed the government to act so that the ""majority of Muslims who overwhelmingly condemn the recent terrorist attacks are not lumped together with the fomenters of hate.""
'IT HURT US'
Garnoussi was bewildered by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo's decision in September to re-publish caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad that had caused outrage across the Muslim world when they first appeared in a Danish newspaper in 2005.
The magazine did so to mark the trial of the alleged accomplices in a militant attack in 2015 in which 12 people, including some of its best-known cartoonists, were killed.
Weeks after the re-publication, a Chechen teenager beheaded a high school teacher who had used the cartoons in a class on freedom expression. Last week a woman was decapitated and two other people killed in Nice in a suspected Islamist attack.
The French government defended the caricatures, saying that the country's secular values permitted blasphemy.
For Garnoussi, their publication was a deliberately provocative act that risked making life harder for the many among France's estimated five million Muslims who, like her, condemn violence in the name of religion.
""It hurt us and left us feeling the State doesn't love us,"" she said of Charlie Hebdo's actions and the government's defence of them.
President Emmanuel Macron's government responded to the murder of teacher Samuel Paty and the victims in Nice days later with a promise to crack down on what some public officials have called ""the enemy within"".
It has shut down a mosque on the edge of Paris, dismantled at least three Muslim associations suspected of fomenting extremist views and vowed to accelerate legislation to counter Islamic behaviour that runs against the Republic's values.
But in an effort to rectify what Macron said were misapprehensions about France's relationship with Muslims, he stressed in an interview with Al Jazeera that he did not support the cartoons and that France was in no way anti-Muslim.
The president has spoken of creating an ""Islam of France"", or what he has more recently termed an ""enlightened Islam"" that is compatible with his country's secular values.
It is a concept that makes little sense to Garnoussi, for whom Islam transcends borders.

""If I am in Japan, Papua New Guinea or France I will pray five times a day in the same way. It is just my prayer mat, facing Mecca, that will point in a different direction.""

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian immigration officials blocked a prominent anti-police brutality activist from leaving the country and confiscated her passport, she told Reuters on Wednesday.
There was no immediate response from immigration authorities to requests for comment on the assertion by Modupe Odele, a lawyer who has helped arrange legal defence for protesters campaigning against police violence.
Odele said that when she tried to board an international flight at Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos on Nov. 1, immigration authorities told her that she was under military investigation and thus barred from leaving Nigeria.
When she met immigration authorities on Nov. 3, they declined to return her passport, but did not tell her why the military is investigating her or outline any charges. Odele said the military has not contacted her.
Army spokesman Sagir Musa referred questions on Odele's case, and on whether any other protesters were under investigation or barred from travel, to immigration officials. 
A spokesman for the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) did not respond to calls or WhatsApp messages, nor did the Department of State Services, the security agency that would bar Nigerians from leaving or entering the country for security reasons. 
Nigeria's Interior Ministry on Tuesday denied local news reports that said it had compiled a ""no-fly list"", saying that any such list was ""not the responsibility of the ministry or its associated agencies.""
Peaceful demonstrations against police violence turned bloody on Oct. 20, when witnesses and rights group Amnesty International said military and police opened fire on protesters, killing at least 12.
Odele provided help to protesters as part of a group of volunteer lawyers, www.endsarslegalaid.co, trying to secure the release of individuals arrested for protesting against alleged abuses by a police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad.
A human rights group called the Feminist Coalition called on Nigerians to stop protesting, and it closed off new donations after raising 147,855,788.28 naira ($388,072.94), following an appeal by President Muhammadu Buhari on Oct. 22 for an end to the demonstrations.

In a statement at the time, the group said its priority was ""the welfare and safety of the Nigerian youth.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss authorities confirmed on Wednesday that two men arrested near Zurich were ""obviously friends"" of a gunman who killed four people in a shooting rampage in Vienna and said police were investigating the full extent of their relationship with him.
Austrian police shot dead the gunman soon after he opened fire on Monday night on crowded bars in the city centre. They identified him as Kujtim Fejzulai, 20, a convicted jihadist who had dual Austrian and North Macedonian nationality.
Swiss police arrested two men, aged 18 and 24, on Tuesday in the town of Winterthur, which has become a focus of concern about Islamist radicalism in recent years. Austrian police have arrested 14 people as they try to establish whether Fejzulai had any accomplices. 
Swiss Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, in a panel discussion shown on the St. Galler Tagblatt newspaper's website, said the two arrested men were ""obviously friends"" of the gunman. She said they had met ""in person"" but did not say when.
""The suspect in Vienna and the two men who were arrested in Winterthur knew each other,"" a spokesman for Keller-Sutter's ministry told Reuters in an email on Wednesday. ""Authorities are investigating in close coordination the nature of their relationship.""
Both men, whose names have not been released, are already the subject of two criminal cases being prosecuted by the Swiss attorney general's office (OAG) and which were opened in 2018 and 2019, the Swiss attorney general's told Reuters in an email. The older man is a suspect in one of those cases.
ISLAMIST PREACHERS
Winterthur, once a prominent industrial centre about 20 kilometres from the border with Germany, was the site of a now-shuttered mosque that officials said had attracted preachers who espoused ""hate speech"". 
Several young people from the Winterthur area who were linked to the mosque travelled to Syria to fight with Islamic State. Membership and support of the militant group is outlawed in Switzerland. 
In September, a man Swiss media dubbed the ""Emir of Winterthur"" and described as a leading Islamist militant in Switzerland, was sentenced to 50 months in prison for ties to Islamic State.
Switzerland has largely been spared Islamist violence, but authorities are concerned that the kind of attacks seen in neighbouring France, Germany and now Austria could also occur on Swiss territory.
The OAG said on Wednesday that a fatal stabbing of a Portuguese man in September in the town of Morges, in western Switzerland, was still being investigated for a possible ""terrorist motive"".

A Swiss-Turkish national has been arrested.

The Vatican Embassy in Warsaw said in a statement that local Church officials would look into allegations against Archbishop Leszek Slawoj Glodz, who retired in August.
The embassy said the archbishop of Warsaw would investigate Glodz for ""reported negligence"" that had led to the alleged ""detriment of minors by some clergy of the Gdansk Archdiocese"".
Last year priests in Gdansk accusing Glodz of covering up instances of sexual abuse. At the time, Glodz denied any wrongdoing. Efforts to reach Glodz for comment on the new inquiry were unavailing, with the Gdansk curia saying he did not have a spokesman and that Glodz's whereabouts were not known.
Last month, Pope Francis accepted the resignation of the bishop of Kalisz, Edward Janiak, who was accused of shielding priests known to have sexually abused children.
In May, Church leaders in Poland referred Janiak to the Vatican for judgment after a film by brothers Tomasz and Marek Sekielski purported to show that Janiak failed to take action against priests who were known to have abused children.. Janiak has also denied wrongdoing.
The Sekielski brothers made another film that suggested known paedophiles were deliberately shifted between parishes. The film has had more than 23 million views on YouTube.

LONDON/LAGOS/SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A day after Americans voted in a bitterly contested election, the rest of the world was none the wiser on Wednesday, with millions of votes still to count, the race too close to call and a mounting risk of days or even weeks of legal uncertainty.
Donald Trump's pre-emptive declaration of victory at the White House was condemned by some U.S. political commentators and civil rights groups, who warned about the trampling of long-standing democratic norms. 
Most world leaders and foreign ministers sat on their hands, trying not to add any fuel to the electoral fire.
""Let's wait and see what the outcome is,"" said British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. ""There's obviously a significant amount of uncertainty. It's much closer than I think many had expected.""
But while Raab and others urged caution, the Slovenian prime minister broke ranks, congratulating Trump and the Republican party via Twitter.
""It's pretty clear that American people have elected @realDonaldTrump and @Mike_Pence for #4moreyears,"" wrote Janez Jansa, one of several east European leaders, including Hungary's Viktor Orban, who are fervent Trump allies. ""Congratulations @GOP for strong results across the #US.""
The latest vote tally showed Democrat challenger Joe Biden with a lead in the Electoral College - 224 votes to 213, with 270 needed for victory - but with counting still be completed in at least five major 'battleground' states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Georgia. 
In 2000, the election between George W. Bush and Al Gore hinged on Florida. It was ultimately decided in Bush's favour by the U.S. Supreme Court, in a ruling five weeks after the vote. 
In his comments, Trump suggested the Supreme Court - to which he has nominated three of the nine justices - would have to decide the winner again.
On Twitter, the hashtags #Trump, #Biden and #USElections2020 were trending from Russia to Pakistan, Malaysia to Kenya and across Europe and Latin America, underscoring how much every region of the world sees the outcome as pivotal.
In Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have accused of trying to interfere in the election, there was no official reaction.
But Pro-Kremlin lawmaker Vyacheslav Nikonov, the grandson of Stalin's foreign minister, advised Russians to stock up on popcorn to watch the show he predicted was about to unfold, saying U.S. society was fatally split.
""The result of the elections is the worst outcome for America,"" Nikonov, who welcomed Trump's 2016 win, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""Whoever wins the legal battles half of Americans will not consider them the lawful president. Let's stock up on large quantities of popcorn."" 
'IT AFFECTS US ALL'
In Australia, crowds watched the results roll in while drinking beer in an American bar in Sydney.
""The news is so much better when Trump is in,"" said Glen Roberts, wearing a red 'Make Europe Great Again' baseball cap. ""You never know what he said, it's so good. I think it'll be less interesting if Trump loses.""
Others were quick to underline the ramifications of the U.S. vote worldwide. ""I think it affects us all, what happens over there really matters for the next four years over here,"" said Sydney resident Luke Heinrich.
New York-based Human Rights Watch, one of the world's leading civil rights groups, warned about the need to reserve judgment on the results until every vote is counted. With a very high number of mail-in ballots this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, full tallies are expected to take days in some states. 
Executive director Kenneth Roth said premature declarations of victory were dangerous.
""Autocrats might be perfectly happy to undermine democracy in the United States by welcoming a premature declaration of victory,"" he said.
China, whose relations with the United States have sunk to their worst in decades under Trump, said the election was a domestic affair and it had ""no position on it"".
Chinese social media users, however, were quick to mock the failure of the U.S. electoral system to deliver a quick and clear result.
""Whether he wins or loses, his final mission is to destroy the appearance of American democracy,"" one user on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) platform wrote on Wednesday.
""Let Trump be re-elected and take the U.S. downhill,"" another wrote.
In Nigeria, one leading politician, Senator Shehu Sani, said the uncertainty in the United States was reminiscent of Africa.

""Africa used to learn American democracy, America is now learning African democracy,"" he tweeted to his 1.6 million followers.

The bill was approved by 265 votes to 193 in the 630-member chamber and now needs a final green light from the upper house Senate, where it has the support of the ruling coalition parties, before becoming law. 
It modifies an existing law punishing offences based on someone's race or religion with up to four years in jail.
""It is a big step forward against discrimination, hatred and violence,"" Alessandro Zan, the openly gay lawmaker who promoted the law, wrote on Twitter.
The change was championed by the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), but faced opposition from right-wing parties and the Italian Roman Catholic Church, which said existing protections were strong enough.
The conservative campaign group Pro Life and Family has said the bill will make LGBT+ people ""more equal than others"", while Italian bishops warned last June that the new law could curb dissenting opinions, including that a family requires the union of a man and a woman.
Zan has denied that the bill would impinge on free speech, saying it would only punish those who incite hatred.
LGBT+ advocacy groups say homophobia is a serious problem in Italy and have long complained that homophobic and transphobic attacks are tried on lesser charges than racist assaults.
Italy's largest LGBT+ rights group, Arcigay, records more than 100 hate crime and discrimination cases each year, but numerous attempts over the last 25 years to create a law to punish acts of homophobia and transphobia have failed.

In Italy, where same-sex unions were passed in 2016, the approval of civil rights laws has often been marked by strong opposition from Catholic and conservative groups.

The quake, the deadliest to hit Turkey in nearly a decade, injured 1,035 people in Izmir and 137 were still being treated, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said.
It said search and rescue efforts at 17 damaged or collapsed buildings had been completed and teams were clearing the rubble.
In addition to the 114 people killed in Turkey, two victims of the tremor were teenagers on the Greek island of Samos, authorities said.
On Tuesday, 90 hours after the quake struck, rescuers in Izmir pulled a young girl alive out of the rubble. 
More than 2,790 tents were set up for temporary shelter and more than 10,222 beds were distributed in the area, AFAD said.
It said 22 boats had sunk and 43 others had run aground, of which 40 had been rescued, as a result of the quake.
Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. More than 500 people were killed in a 2011 quake in the eastern city of Van, while another in January this year killed 41 people in the eastern province of Elazig.
In 1999, two powerful quakes killed 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. 

AFAD said Friday's earthquake had a magnitude of 6.6, with 1,855 aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude at 7.0 and the Kandilli Observatory in Istanbul said it was 6.9.

A Palestinian security official named the dead man as Bilal Rawajba, a Preventive Security Service officer and resident of a village outside Nablus. Rawajba had been expected to drive from home to his workplace on Wednesday, the official said. 
Preventive Security is among Palestinian security services that have often cooperated with Israel in keeping a cap on West Bank violence that has simmered since diplomacy between the sides stalled in 2014.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 05:41AM ET</span>",Analysis: Bad blood - why France-Turkey cartoon row could leave lasting impact,"By Michel Rose and Orhan Coskun
PARIS/ANKARA (Reuters) - Slights and barbs have marred relations between France's Emmanuel Macron and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan for years, but the row over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad has dragged them to a new low which could have more lasting consequences.
Officials on both sides describe a series of behind-the-scenes frosty exchanges and grudges between the two leaders going back years, long before the row of the past few weeks.
But if they cannot find a way to mend bridges, momentum is likely to build for a proposal, driven by France, for European Union sanctions on Turkey's already-fragile economy, according to Turkish analyst Sinan Ulgen.
""Neither Erdogan in Turkey nor Macron in France will step back,"" said Ulgen, head of the Istanbul-based Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies think tank.
A French official familiar with policy towards Turkey said that in the light of the events of the past few weeks: ""The question of sanctions is going to be raised."" 
EU leaders have already said that if Turkey fails to de-escalate tensions in the eastern Mediterranean by Dec. 10, sanctions would follow, though there is no draft proposal yet. 
The latest dispute flared after a French teacher who showed pupils cartoons of the Prophet published in the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo was beheaded in France last month. 
The French government, backed by many citizens, saw it as an attack on freedom of speech. Macron vowed to redouble efforts to stop conservative Islamic beliefs subverting French values. 
Erdogan accused Macron of an anti-Islamic agenda and said he needed a mental health check. Western countries mocking Islam, he said, want to ""relaunch the Crusades"". 
At root, Franco-Turkish ties soured because of rival strategic interests, analysts and officials say.
Ankara has growing influence in Syria, north Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, while Macron is the most outspoken defender of European interests in those places.
The rivalry has spilled into personal clashes before.
In August 2017, three months after he became president, Macron told an interviewer that having to talk to Erdogan was one reason being head of state was not as ""cool"" as people thought.
The comment caused ""big disappointment and shock"" in Erdogan's entourage, said one senior Turkish official.
""The president chose to directly convey his discontent over the comment to Macron himself,"" the official said.
Then, in March 2018, Macron met a delegation including the Syrian Kurdish YPG, a group designated by Turkey as a terrorist organisation but viewed by Western powers as an ally against Islamic State in Syria.
Erdogan publicly accused France of abetting terrorism. A source close to the Turkish leader said Macron's stance on the Kurds ""causes tensions both in some face-to-face meetings and phone calls.""

French officials grew frustrated by Turkey's actions in Syria, accusing it of backing radical Islamists among the rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad, a charge Ankara denied. 
When they objected, French officials said, Turkey hinted it could send Syrian refugees toward Europe's borders, jeopardising a deal with the EU to stem the flow of migrants into Europe in return for billions of euros in aid.
Erdogan repeatedly threatened, in public speeches, to ""open the gates"" for Syrian refugees. A second French official said Macron's team viewed such threats as attempted blackmail.
By the time Erdogan and Macron met at a NATO summit in July 2018, relations were particularly low. 
Delegation members had fraught exchanges and eventually all officials were sent out, apart from interpreters, so Erdogan and Macron could talk man to man, the second French official said.
But there was no thaw. ""It's a cold relationship,"" said the French official. Asked for their account of the meeting, Turkish officials did not comment. 
In November 2019, Macron told an interviewer NATO was experiencing ""brain death"" because a member state, Turkey, was going against alliance interests in the Middle East. In response, Erdogan said Macron should check if he was brain dead.
After that, said a French diplomat, ""there was a deterioration in relations.""
The two leaders nonetheless kept open lines of communication. Phone conversations were civil, according to the French diplomat. Macron's team distinguished Erdogan's public rhetoric, which they felt was to shore up his domestic support, and his real intentions, the diplomat said.
But the rhetoric of recent weeks has reached an unprecedented low.
The French president decided not to reciprocate to Erdogan's latest comments, the first French official said, because personal insults were undignified.
While world leaders sent Macron text messages offering condolences on the killing of the teacher, none were sent to Macron on Erdogan's behalf, the official said. 
Macron's predecessor as president, Francois Hollande, had frequent interactions with Erdogan while he was in office and compared him to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""Erdogan is a nationalist orator who, like Putin, is capable of flying off the handle,"" Hollande told Reuters.

""In a month or two, if he needs to, he will speak to Macron, but it remains to be seen if Macron will let him do that without consequences.""

Democratic challenger Joe Biden has promised to rejoin Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers if Iran returns to compliance with it.
President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. In retaliation, Iran has gradually reduced compliance with the deal's terms.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or that the protests were linked to the U.S. election, but some demonstrators carried ""Black Lives Matter"" banners, Q13 Fox Seattle television reported.
The Seattle Police Department said the arrested people included one who put nails in a road and another who drove over a barricade and into a police bike lane.
Two marches were held through the city's South Lake Union and Capitol Hill areas, with the police cautioning people travelling to those places.
The police said marchers had moved traffic barricades into the roadway, with the police initially issuing a public safety warning and then a dispersal order to a group of protesters at Broadway.
""Eight arrests this evening for pedestrian interference, obstruction, assault on an officer, reckless driving, and criminal mischief"", Seattle Police said on Twitter.
In recent months, Seattle, like elsewhere in the United States, has seen protests against racism and police brutality following the death in May of George Floyd, an African-American who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters have previously called for police reforms.
Election day unfolded smoothly across much of the United States in a mostly calm show of political determination and civic duty amid the coronavirus pandemic despite fears of disruption.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia said on Wednesday it has begun military operations in the Tigray region, after the prime minister accused the local government of attacking federal troops.
In September, Tigray held regional elections in defiance of the federal government, which called the vote ""illegal"". The row has escalated in recent days with both sides accusing each other of plotting a military conflict. 
Military operations in the region had commenced, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum told Reuters, without giving further details. 
Earlier on Wednesday, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) attempted to steal artillery and other equipment from federal forces stationed there, Abiy's office said in a statement.
""The last red line has been crossed with this morning's attacks and the federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,"" the statement said.
The Ethiopian National Defence Forces have been ordered to carry out ""their mission to save the country and the region from spiralling into instability"", it added said.
Tigray's local government said that the Northern Command of the federal military, which is stationed in the region, had defected to its side. Billene dismissed the claim as ""false information"".
Internet access monitor NetBlocks said that the Internet had been shut down in the region, confirming reports that authorities had shut down telephone and Internet services.
Debretsion Gebremichael, the president of the Tigray region, said on Monday that Abiy's government was planning to attack the region to punish it for holding the September election.
The developments in Ethiopia could have grave consequences for the region, warned Asnake Kefale, an associate professor of political science at the University of Addis Ababa.
""This conflict could destabilise the wider region if the Ethiopian army can't get the violence across the country under control,"" Asnake said.
Tigrayans ruled Ethiopian politics since guerrilla fighters ousted a Marxist dictator in 1991, but their influence has waned under Abiy. Last year, the TPLF quit his ruling coalition.
Since Abiy came to power in 2018, many senior Tigrayan officials have been detained, fired or sidelined, in what the federal government describes as a clamp-down on corruption but Tigrayans see as a means to quell dissent.
Tigray's population makes up 5% of Ethiopia's 109 million people, but it is wealthier and more influential than many other, larger regions.
Its army is a well-trained force dating back to the 1980s when it led the guerrilla movement that brought the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front coalition to power, analysts say.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 01:30AM ET</span>",North Korea man crossed armed border in possible defection to South,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's military said on Wednesday it had taken into custody a North Korean man who crossed the heavily fortified border with North Korea in a potential defection to the South, prompting an urgent search operation. 
The man was found about 9:50 a.m. on the eastern end of the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said, adding there was no unusual movement among North Korean troops. 
""An investigation is planned to find out details about the man, including how he had come down and whether he wished to defect,"" the JCS said in a statement. 
The person was first spotted crossing barbed wire fences installed along the border at 7:26 p.m. on Tuesday (1026 GMT), the News1 agency reported, citing an unnamed military source. 
The Yonhap news agency said that the military had issued a ""Jindotgae"" anti-infiltration alert for the eastern border area, and that the man had expressed a willingness to defect. 
The defence ministry declined to confirm those reports, citing an ongoing investigation. 
The operation came as South Korea on Wednesday restarted tours to the southern part of the DMZ, which has seen several armed clashes but also served as a venue for key inter-Korean events, including some of the most recent summits. 
But the programme was suspended in October 2019 after an outbreak of deadly African swine fever broke out in North Korea, and then due to concerns about the novel coronavirus this year. 
Unification Minister Lee In-young, celebrating the tours' resumption, made no mention of the North Korean man but called for free travel among all Koreans within the DMZ and a recovery of inter-Korean hotlines severed amid strained ties. 
""Re-establishing round-the-clock communication channels would be a basis for restoring inter-Korean relations,"" Lee, who oversees cross-border affairs, told a ceremony at the truce village of Panmunjom within the DMZ. 
The latest case marked the first border crossing since a North Korean soldier defected to the South via the central DMZ in July 2019. 
In late 2018, another North Korean soldier defected via the eastern DMZ. In a more dramatic escape to the South in 2017, North Korean troops fired at a soldier when he drove an army truck through Panmunjom. 
Inter-Korean relations soured as denuclearisation talks between Pyongyang and Washington stalled last year. In September, North Korean troops shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who went missing at sea, sparking public and political furore in the South.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Houston LGBTQ bar Buddy's offered Texans a unique election experience on Tuesday: casting ballots for the U.S. presidential election in 14 voting booths on its dance floor. 
Buddy's is the first bar to serve as a voting venue in Harris County - the largest in Texas by population - after owner Christopher Barry proposed it to officials seeking to make voting easier during the coronavirus pandemic. 
“This is our way of trying to help our community,” said Barry, 41, who described the set-up as “Vote in the Front; Party in the Back.”
Bar patrons drank Dos Equis beer on the outside patio as voters cast their ballots inside. A garage door separated the two areas, providing the privacy and peace to vote. 
“It really doesn’t feel like I’m in a voting place at all,” said Bryan Cervantes, 36, a graphic designer who was one of the roughly 100 voters who had voted at the site by Tuesday afternoon. ""It was super simple.”
Outside, drag queens with the nonprofit group Joy To The Polls danced and lip-synched to songs as part of an effort that organizers said was geared toward increasing voter turnout. 
“We’re here to bring joy to the polls, literally,” said Athena Sapphire, 26, whose legal name is Ervin Johnson.
Bedecked in a floral jumpsuit with bell-bottom cuffs, Sapphire roller-skated around the bar's parking lot.
“No matter who people plan to vote for, we want to encourage them to come out and vote,” Sapphire said. 
Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins, 34, showed up at Buddy's in cowboy hat and boots to talk to voters and bar patrons. 
“Why not have a polling location that people can find easily?” said Hollins, a Democrat.
After Harris County boosted its election budget sevenfold from 2016 to $27.7 million, Hollins tripled early-voting locations to 120, including drive-through voting that has been contested in courts by Republican groups and some polling sites that are open 24/7. 
On Election Day, more than 800 voting locations were open across the county, including a funeral home, a stadium, schools, libraries and community centers. 

No long lines were reported on Tuesday anywhere in the county, which is larger than the state of Rhode Island and has 2.5 million registered voters.

Long one of the more conservative regions in Mexico, Puebla joins the majority of Mexico's 32 states in recognizing same-sex marriages despite opposition from the Church and some traditionalist groups.
The push for marriage equality and LGBT rights has grown in Mexico over the last two decades, with discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation outlawed since 2003.
Still, advocates have also warned of rising violence against LGBT people in Mexico this year, especially transgender women.
Long governed by conservative administrations, Puebla is now in the hands of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA).

While Lopez Obrador himself is careful not to alienate socially conservative voters, many in the left-wing base of his party are staunch supporters of socially liberal causes.

1280,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 07:18PM ET</span>","Johnson, Facing Rebels, Set to Push U.K. Lockdown Rules Through","(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson is set to push fresh coronavirus lockdown rules through the U.K. Parliament on Wednesday, facing down rebels in his own Conservative Party who reject the erosion of civil liberties they entail.
The regulations are due to take effect from midnight, enforcing the closing of pubs, gyms and non-essential shops in England, and restricting social contact between households. The prime minister announced the month-long lockdown on Saturday after data showed the pandemic exceeding even the worst-case projections of his scientific advisers, threatening to overwhelm hospitals.
There’s also a political cost to the prime minister, who for weeks opposed a fresh lockdown as a “nuclear” option, ridiculing opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer for demanding one. His U-turn sparked concerns among business leaders and anger within his party.
“We are in this house to serve, not dictate,” rank-and-file Tory Member of Parliament Richard Drax said in a parliamentary debate Tuesday. “As we hurtle towards another lockdown, I would not be doing my constituents a service if I did not question the wisdom of following what has already been implemented and failed.”
Johnson Will Find Out Size of Tory Rebellion in Lockdown Vote
Both Graham (NYSE:GHM) Brady (NYSE:BRC), chairman of the influential 1922 committee of rank-and-file Tory lawmakers, and his deputy, Charles Walker, have said they’ll vote against the regulations, but Walker told Sky News on Monday he doesn’t expect the rebellion to exceed 20. That’s fewer than half the 42 Tories who rebelled in a vote last month to confirm the government’s imposition of a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants.
Nevertheless, the rules appear certain to go through because Starmer has said Labour will vote for them, making any small-scale Tory rebellion moot.
The rebels are demanding proof that Johnson has an exit strategy, amid fears the curbs will be extended if the infection rate has not dropped sufficiently, and the premier on Tuesday sought to allay concerns that the rules might be in place for longer than a month.
Deaths
“The crucial thing to understand about these measures is that they expire on Dec. 2, they come to an end,” Johnson told his cabinet. He then said authorities will use the next month to develop programs of mass testing that will enable the country to open up again.
Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty on Tuesday told lawmakers that the looming lockdown offers a “realistic possibility” of allowing England to return to looser social-distancing restrictions in December -- if people obey the rules. He said the new rules could “pull us back in time” and bring the reproduction rate of the virus below the key threshold where it spreads exponentially.
Critics of the new curbs have questioned the projections behind the decision, specifically one warning there could be 4,000 deaths per day without intervention, which was used by a Johnson in a televised presentation Saturday.
The government published the modeling Tuesday and, while one model projected deaths peaking at 4,000 a day just before Christmas without any extra restrictions to halt the spread of Covid, a graph of consensus projections showed daily deaths in England at lower than 1,000 in December.
But Whitty said even the lower number “would imply significant pressure” on other parts of the health service, and warned that matching the spring peak of about 1,000 deaths per day “is entirely realistic” without the government taking action.
In another sign of the difficulties the measures are causing the prime minister, the government angered Scottish National Party Leader Nicola Sturgeon because of the lack of clarity over whether the financial assistance that accompanies the lockdown will apply also to Scotland if it follows England into stricter rules.

MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - In a makeshift refugee camp just across the border from Brownsville, Texas, Oscar Borjas and a few friends are planning to gather on Tuesday night to watch anxiously as results from the U.S. presidential election roll in.
Borjas, a Honduran asylum seeker who has spent the last year living in a cold and unsanitary encampment in Matamoros, Mexico, is not a U.S. voter. 
He is among the tens of thousands of migrants whose lives have been upended by the Trump administration's immigration policies – and who are now praying for Republican President Donald Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, to win the election.
""We're all hoping for Biden,"" he said.
From Tijuana to Matamoros, asylum seekers stranded along the border by the Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy are holding their breath as Americans head to the polls. Over a dozen interviewed by Reuters say they believe a Biden victory would offer them a better chance of escaping dangerous Mexican border towns and entering the United States while pursuing their asylum cases.
""I'm here praying. I'm not religious but I'm still praying that Trump's forced out,"" said Yuri Gonzalez, a Cuban asylum seeker who has spent more than a year and a half stranded in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, as he waits for his asylum claim to be processed by U.S. courts.
""A man who's spent four years separating families and fueling racist violence doesn't deserve to be president,"" he added, speaking as he cut hair in the barber shop where he works.
The Trump administration has enacted a series of overlapping policies, including ""Remain in Mexico,"" that have made it all but impossible to request asylum at the U.S. southern border.
Link: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-TRUMP/IMMIGRATION-PROFILES/gjnvwjbldpw/
The administration says these measures, including ""Remain in Mexico,"" have succeeded in curbing immigration to the United States and discouraging ""false asylum claims.""
Some migrants interviewed by Reuters were well aware that Biden has promised to end the program ""Remain in Mexico"" on his first day in office. Others were not familiar with his name.
But from coast to coast, more than a dozen asylum seekers were unanimous: anyone but Trump.
""I don't know all the policy proposals of the other candidate who isn't Trump, but I know he doesn't think the same way,"" said Santos, a Honduran asylum seeker in the western city of Tijuana who declined to give his last name. He said he encouraged all his family members in the United States to vote against Trump.
Many asylum seekers, including Santos, expressed anger not only over ""Remain in Mexico,"" but over other immigration-related issues, particularly the separation of families.
""I came here by myself out of fear that the same thing could happen to us,"" said Santos, explaining that although he fears for the safety of his children back in Honduras, he also worried they might have gotten lost in U.S. custody if they were separated from him.
Back on the other side of Mexico, Borjas is planning to hold his Election Night ""watch party"" on the concrete steps next to the refugee camp's cell-phone charging station, since the encampment's hundreds of asylum seekers live in tents without electricity. 
""Biden's wife came here to Matamoros and promised to help us, and that's the hope we're holding onto,"" he said.

Biden, who has the backing of environmental groups, has criticized Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of deforestation in the Amazon. A Biden administration would be expected to put the environment and human rights at the top of the bilateral agenda, complicating relations and jeopardizing trade, diplomats and analysts have told Reuters.
Destruction of the rain forest has soared under the right-wing Bolsonaro, an ally of Republican U.S. President Donald Trump who plans to develop the Amazon saying this will reduce poverty. Environmental advocates say his policies exacerbate climate change and embolden illegal loggers, miners and ranchers.
Mourao said Brazil is doing its best to look after the forest and will continue doing so whoever is in the White House.
""We have put out more than 7,500 forest fires,"" he told reporters. ""I would like to show better results, we have not managed yet, but we will persist.""
Mourao acknowledged that there would be ""some changes"" in U.S. policy if Biden wins, but no radical change on the Brazilian end. He joked that he does not expect that ""the U.S. Army 18th Airborne Corps will land in the Amazon and everything will change."" 
Mourao said much of the criticism of Brazil is due to a lack of knowledge about the Amazon. He said he will take a group of mainly European diplomats on a three-day visit to the Amazon starting on Wednesday to show them what Brazil is doing to preserve the forest, hoping to boost Brazil's international reputation.

The diplomats will be flown over the Amazon jungle, visit a zoo run by the army, a police lab for fighting environmental crimes and the meeting of the waters of the Amazon and Rio Negro rivers, the region's main tourist attraction.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department cleared the potential sale of four sophisticated U.S.-made aerial drones to Taiwan in a formal notification sent to Congress, the Pentagon said on Tuesday, the last step before finalizing a weapons sale that will further anger China.
The $600 million deal would be the first such sale since U.S. policy on the export of sophisticated and closely guarded drone technology was loosened by the Trump administration.
Reuters reported in recent weeks on the administration moving ahead with four other sales of sophisticated military equipment to Taiwan, with a total value of around $5 billion, as it ramps up pressure on China and concerns rise about Beijing's intentions toward the island.
The U.S. State Department's formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales, which is unlikely given broad bipartisan support for the defense of Taiwan.
The four MQ-9 SeaGuardian drones, made by General Atomic Aeronautical System, Inc of San Diego, California, would come with associated ground stations, spares and training. While the drones are armable, they will be outfitted with surveillance equipment.
Reuters reported in September that sales of major weapons systems to Taiwan were making their way through the U.S. export process.
On Oct. 21, the State Department sent notifications to Congress for the first tranche of arms sales to Taiwan. They included truck-based rocket launchers made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), Rocket System (HIMARS) Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) missiles and related equipment made by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, and external sensor pods for F-16 jets.
On Oct. 26 the United States moved ahead with the proposed sale of 100 cruise missile stations and 400 land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by  Boeing Co .
Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province that it has vowed to bring under control, by force if necessary. Washington considers it an important democratic outpost and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.

In response to the sales, China's Ministry of National Defense said http://eng.mod.gov.cn/news/2020-10/28/content_4873333.htm on Oct. 27, ""China strongly urges the U.S. side to immediately withdraw plans of arms sales to Taiwan, cease US-Taiwan military contacts and stop selling weapons to the island.""

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra on Tuesday said opposition lawmakers were irresponsibly ""playing with democracy"" by seeking to impeach him and that he would answer their ""baseless"" charges against him in Congress later this week.
In doing so, Vizcarra said he would seek to preempt a congressional summons to appear before lawmakers on Monday, Nov. 9. The charges against the president relate to alleged bribes for public works tenders when he was a governor. 
Vizcarra said it was critical to end political uncertainty as the world's second-largest copper producer seeks to recover its health and economy amid a pandemic that has so far generated 906,500 cases and 34,500 deaths in Peru. 
""It would be extremely irresponsible for us to be on a razor's edge five months before the elections, playing with democracy,"" he told journalists during a trip to the north of the country to inspect public works programs. 
The move to oust Vizcarra follows media reports that the president allegedly accepted bribes of about 2.3 million soles ($637,000) from two companies that won public works tenders when he was governor of Peru's southern Moquegua region. 
On Monday night, lawmakers approved the holding of an impeachment debate in a 60-40 vote with 18 abstentions. 
For the motion to succeed, it must be approved by at least 87 of a total of 130 votes in the legislature. 
It is the second impeachment bid in two months. An earlier motion to remove Vizcarra over allegedly irregular government contracts to a little-known singer failed with just 32 votes in its favor. 

Vizcarra, 57, does not have his own party representation in Congress. He was installed in 2018 after the resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski due to a corruption case, and his term ends in July.

Though the political climate is tense, this could be but a bureaucratic slowdown. Verdicts become binding after they’re printed in a government gazette and the cabinet had until Nov. 2 to publish a ruling that further tightens one of Europe’s strictest laws on ending pregnancies.
“There’s discussion about the president’s proposal and it’s good to give yourself some time for dialogue and to work out a new position,” Michal Dworczyk, the head of the prime minister’s chancellery, told broadcaster TVN24 on Tuesday.
The standoff with protesters comes as the government has told people to stay indoors to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which hasn’t stopped pro-choice women from taking to the streets.
The ruling Law & Justice party has lost about a quarter of its supporters as the tussle over civil liberties drags on.
Delaying Tactics?
The cabinet has in the past delayed publications of rulings it disagreed with, but this time the move appears aimed at avoiding -- at least for now -- escalation that could stoke even bigger demonstrations.
Last Friday, at least 100,000 people gathered in a march in Warsaw and more than half a million protested across the country.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with how to decide a convicted Mississippi murderer's challenge to his sentence of life in prison without parole for a crime he committed at age 15 - a sentence he argued was unconstitutional based on a 2012 ruling by the justices.
The court heard arguments by teleconference in an appeal brought by Brett Jones, now 31, who was convicted of fatally stabbing his grandfather in 2004 in a dispute involving Jones' girlfriend.
The appeal seeks to expand the reach of a 2012 Supreme Court ruling in which the justices decided that mandatory life sentences without parole in homicide cases involving juvenile killers violated the U.S. Constitution Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The court had previously ruled that juveniles cannot be executed and only juveniles accused of murder could be subject to life without parole sentences.
In 2016, the justices decided that the 2012 ruling applied retroactively, meaning that convicted criminals imprisoned years earlier could argue for their release. 
The Jones case concerned whether a judge must separately find that a juvenile offender is ""permanently incorrigible"" before imposing a life-without-parole sentence. The trial judge who sentenced Jones did not do so.
The justices on Tuesday asked questions during the argument on what exactly judges are required to do at sentencing, with some indicating a specific finding of incorrigibility should not be required.
Since the 2016 ruling, the makeup of the court has changed, with the addition of three justices appointed by President Donald Trump, creating a 6-3 conservative majority.
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito seemed eager that the newly constituted court reverse course on curbing juvenile sentencing under the Eighth Amendment.
""What would you say to any members of this court who are concerned that we have now gotten light years away from the original meaning of the Eighth Amendment and who are reluctant to go any further on this travel into space?"" Alito asked Jones' lawyer.
The newest justice, Trump appointee Amy Comey Barrett, was participating in her second day of arguments since being confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate last week. Barrett wondered why Jones did not simply challenge his sentence directly under the Eighth Amendment rather than relying on the 2012 precedent.
Of the 50 states, 29 allow life-without-parole sentences for juveniles and 20 states have no prisoners serving such sentences, according to the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit group that supports sentencing reform.

The Supreme Court last year took up a case involving Lee Boyd Malvo, who was 17 when he took part in the deadly 2002 ""D.C. Sniper"" shooting spree in the Washington area, to decide the legal question in the Jones case. 
The court ended up dismissing that case after Virginia, where Malvo was sentenced, changed its parole law. The court then took up the Jones case instead.
A ruling is due by the end of June.

Journalist Andrea Rocchelli and his Russian colleague Andrey Mironov died after they were hit by mortar fire near the town of Slaviansk as they were covering fighting between pro-Russian forces and Ukrainian troops.
Italian prosecutors said Vitaliy Markiv, a volunteer fighter with the Ukrainian forces at the time, had taken part in the deadly attack and accused him of being an accessory to murder.
At the initial trial, judges found him guilty, but the appeals court overturned the ruling and ordered Markiv to be released from prison, to the delight of Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov who attended the hearing.
""All of Ukraine has been following this case and we are very happy,"" he told reporters after the sentence was read out. ""The truth is Vitaliy had nothing to do with this affair."" 
Markiv holds joint Ukrainian-Italian citizenship and was arrested after he flew back to Italy in 2017 to see his mother. He always denied the charges.

Ukraine has blamed Russia for the deaths.

Widespread outrage among women and others greeted the Oct. 22 ruling which bans terminations due to foetal defects, ending one of the few legal grounds left for abortion in a staunchly Roman Catholic country with a deeply conservative government. 
While focused largely on abortion rights, the protests quickly turned into an outpouring of anger against the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government, its church allies and its traditionalist policies. On Tuesday two protesters stripped naked in front of the Presidential Palace.
The government's publications department had initially said the court's verdict would be enforced by Nov. 2, but it has not yet been published in its official gazette, meaning it has not entered into legal force.
""According to the regulations, the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal should be published in a timely manner,"" government spokesman Piotr Muller told a news conference when asked about the delay. 
""At the moment, however, we all need peace and discussion around this judgment, a quieting down of the public mood and discussions among experts.""
President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, has tried to defuse the protests by proposing a bill which would reinstate the right to abortion due to foetal abnormalities, although limited only to ""lethal"" defects.
Opposition politicians questioned whether the PiS could muster enough votes to pass the amendment, after parliament delayed a sitting scheduled for Wednesday for two weeks.
""...They don't have any ideas how to resolve the situation in Poland, they do not have a majority in parliament (in favour of the bill), they are afraid to answer questions,"" opposition Deputy Speaker Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska told reporters.
PiS lawmaker and Deputy Parliament Speaker Ryszard Terlecki rejected any suggestion that the government lacked a majority on the issue, saying the postponement was related to the coronavirus pandemic.
Poland's Federation for Women and Family Planning said on Tuesday women had intensified efforts to get a legal abortion in recent days ahead of the court verdict coming into force.

It said it knew of 61 abortions performed in hospitals in less than two weeks since the Constitutional Tribunal's ruling, a rate of occurrence that would send the annual total well above that of 1,100 recorded in 2019.

Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, who is the Greek Cypriot leader, met with newly-elected Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar late Tuesday at a United Nations compound in the capital Nicosia. It was their first encounter since Tatar was elected head of breakaway northern Cyprus in October.
Tatar and Anastasiades ""expressed their determination to positively respond to the U.N. Secretary-General's commitment to explore the possibility to convene an informal five-plus-United Nations meeting, in a conducive climate, at an appropriate stage,"" a spokesperson of the United Nations mission on the island said in a statement.
A 'five-plus' format would include representatives of Cyprus's two communities, along with Greece, Turkey and Britain as the island's guarantor powers, and also the United Nations.
The United Nations has been grappling inconclusively for years to reunite Cyprus, split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. The last attempt collapsed in disarray after several days of negotiations attended by all parties in mid-2017.

Cyprus's division is a key source of friction between NATO allies Greece and Turkey, which are themselves now embroiled in a separate row over maritime rights in the eastern Mediterranean.

Almost 400,000 people have fled their homes in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado, according to the World Food Programme. Home to gas projects worth some $60 billion, the province is also the target of an Islamist insurgency with links to Islamic State that has flourished since 2017. 
The boat was carrying 74 people fleeing the violence when it sank on Sunday in the Indian Ocean between the islands of Ibo and Matemo, just north of the provincial capital of Pemba, where many have sought refuge, Ibo district administrator Issa Tarmamade said by phone. 
He said 32 of those people were rescued by a passing sail boat, while the others were feared dead. Some bodies had already been found, including the body of a child recovered on Ibo island on Tuesday. 
""We are combing the area... We expect to find more dead bodies on the shores of those islands,"" he said, adding while the cause of the accident was not known, the small boat may have been overloaded with people and their belongings. 
Throughout 2020, the insurgent group has massively stepped up the scale and frequency of its attacks, which have seen them beat back government forces to seize a number of significant towns. 
The violence saw thousands of people arrive on Pemba's beaches in a matter of days alone in October.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian police raided 18 properties and arrested 14 people in a massive dragnet on Tuesday, after a gunman identified as a convicted jihadist killed four people and injured 22 in a rampage in the centre of Vienna.
The 20-year-old gunman, who was killed by police minutes after opening fire on crowded bars late on Monday, had been released from jail less than a year ago. He was identified as Kujtim Fejzulai, a Vienna-born Austrian who also held North Macedonian nationality.
It was the first such militant attack in Vienna in a generation, and the government pledged robust action.
""We will defend our fundamental values, our way of life and our democracy with all our strength,"" Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a national address about what he branded an Islamist terror attack. 
""We will find and hunt down the perpetrators, those behind this and their associates and mete out a just sentence. And we will pursue all those who have anything to do with this outrage with all available means.""
Swiss police also arrested two men on Tuesday near Zurich in an investigation of possible links to the gunman.
The attack followed recent deadly assaults by lone Islamist attackers in Nice and Paris. Many Muslims have been angered by the publication in strictly secular France of satirical caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad.
""WE WILL REMAIN UNITED""
In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron visited the Austrian Embassy to write a message of condolence in German that read: ""In joy and in sorrow, we will remain united.""
Both he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Kurz to offer their support as expressions of solidarity poured in from around the world.
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Tuesday for the attack without providing evidence, the group's Amaq News Agency said in a statement on Telegram.
An elderly man and woman, a young passer-by and a waitress were among those killed in the attack, Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said. A German woman was also killed, Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.
Vienna's mayor said three people were still in critical condition.
The normally bustling centre of Vienna was largely empty on Tuesday as the public heeded government calls to stay inside and a manhunt for a possible second gunman was underway.
The gunman, armed with an assault rifle, a handgun and a machete, had opened fire at six places including a bar near Vienna's main synagogue on Monday as people enjoyed a last night out before a COVID-19 curfew took effect.
Police shot the gunman dead within nine minutes of his opening fire on crowded bars, which included one near Vienna's main synagogue. 
Interior Minister Nehammer said Fejzulai had recently served about eight months of a 22-month sentence for seeking to travel to Syria to join Islamic State.
""He was released early exactly because he gave the impression that he had engaged with deradicalisation programmes and was prepared to integrate himself into society,"" Nehammer told a news conference.
Fejzulai had posted a photo on a social media account before the attack, showing himself with weapons, Nehammer said. 
Whether anyone else was involved in carrying out or preparing the attack remained unclear. 
After saying overnight that another attacker was on the loose, Nehammer said there was no indication of another assailant in large volumes of mobile phone footage of the attacks sent in by the public, but it could not be ruled out.
North Macedonia's Interior Ministry said it believed three people - all born in Austria and holding dual Austrian and North Macedonian citizenship - had been involved in the attack. It identified them only by initials and gave no further information.
""This is not a conflict between Christians and Muslims or between Austrians and migrants,"" said Kurz, a conservative whose trademark is a hard line on immigration. ""No, this is a fight between the many people who believe in peace and the few (who oppose it). It is a fight between civilisation and barbarism.""
THE BAND PLAYED ON 
A police spokesman said at least 1,000 officers had been involved in the search for accomplices. The army was guarding sensitive sites in Vienna to free up police for the operation.
The government announced three days of national mourning.
A witness to the attack, Vienna rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister, said he had seen one shooter but could not be certain there were no others.
Videos posted on social media showed a gunman running down a cobbled street shooting and yelling. One showed a man gunning down a person outside a cocktail bar on the street where the synagogue is located, then returning to shoot the same person again.
The shooting took place as the Vienna State Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) was holding its final concert before a month-long coronavirus lockdown. Musicians played on, despite news of the violence outside: ""If people weren't allowed to leave anyway, why should we stop early?"" a spokeswoman said.
After the concert, with the doors still locked, four members of the orchestra came back into the pit to play a Haydn string quartet for those who were still in their seats. 
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: ""These evil attacks against innocent people must stop. The U.S. stands with Austria, France, and all of Europe in the fight against terrorists, including radical Islamic terrorists.""
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden condemned what he called a ""horrific terrorist attack"", adding: ""We must all stand united against hate and violence.""

Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel Al-Jubeir said on Twitter late on Tuesday that the Vienna attack was a ""heinous crime... contrary to all religions and human values"".

Videgaray and other high-ranking politicians, who wielded power under Lopez Obrador's predecessor, were accused of corruption in the deposition of a former chief executive officer of Mexican national oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, leaked in August.
The deposition, whose authenticity is not in dispute, alleges they used bribes from Odebrecht to finance political campaigns and influence lawmakers to support a reform of Mexico's jealously-guarded energy sector. 
""I have been informed that a request of this nature was made to the judiciary, but the request was rejected,"" Lopez Obrador said in a regular news conference. ""My understanding is that the judge sent the request back to the attorney general's office."" 
He said he did not know if a new warrant could be requested.
Mexican news outlet Latinus first reported on the matter.
Neither the attorney general nor Videgaray immediately responded to requests for comment. Videgaray has previously denied wrongdoing in the case.
Former Odebrecht executives have testified about bribes made to Emilio Lozoya, the former Pemex CEO.

Videgaray was the campaign manager of former President Enrique Pena Nieto, Lopez Obrador's predecessor. He initially served as Pena Nieto's finance minister and, in 2017, became foreign minister for the remainder of the administration, which ended on Nov. 30, 2018.

Hopewell Chin'ono was first arrested in July on charges of writing in support of anti-government protests. 
He was detained for more than a month at a maximum security prison until he was released on bail on Sept. 2, with one of the conditions being that he stop posting on his Twitter account until his case was finalised.
But Chin'ono opened a new Twitter account, which he has been using to write about corruption and criticising President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government.
His comments have been unusually outspoken for a journalist in Zimbabwe, where critics are often dealt with harshly.
""He is being charged with contempt of court. He is alleged to have sent out a tweet but at this moment the charges are not very clear so we are weighing our options,"" his lawyer Gift Mtisi told Reuters by phone.
Police spokesman Paul Nyathi declined to comment immediately.
The arrest of Chin'ono and dozens of activists has led to accusations that the government is persecuting the opposition, a charge the authorities deny.

Zimbabwe's worst economic crisis in more than a decade is fuelling anger against Mnangagwa, who took over from the late Robert Mugabe after a coup two years ago, promising to revive the economy and greater freedoms for citizens.

Issuing the second warning in as many days about potential bias in the vote, commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing told a local news outlet that the military was the “guardian” of the country and was watching preparations closely.
The rare interview by local news outlet Popular News Journal followed similar comments in a military statement on Monday that accused the election commission of “widespread violation of the laws and procedures of the pre-voting process”.
A spokesman for Myanmar’s election commission did not answer phone calls seeking comment, nor did a government spokesman.
Min Aung Hlaing said some opposition parties had complained about irregularities, citing voter lists riddled with errors with many people excluded. “There is no problem for normal mistakes. But some are unacceptable mistakes. They have a lot of time to do corrections,” he said.
“We told the election commission we want a free and fair election,” he said.
The election commission is controlled by the government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, which came to power after a landslide election win in 2015 that ended half a century of military and military-backed rule.
But the army retains significant powers under the constitution including control of key ministries like Home Affairs. The military and civilian government have been at odds over various issues for months, including constitutional reform. 

“I said in an interview with media in 2015...that we would accept the result by the election committee as long as it was free and fair. However, for now, we are in a situation where we need to be cautious,” Min Aung Hlaing said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been advised by domestic aides to wait until U.S. election results are official before congratulating his political idol Donald Trump on a win, even if either candidate declares himself winner beforehand, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, has modeled himself on the U.S. president and delights in being called the ""Tropical Trump."" The U.S. leader has not completely redrawn U.S.-Brazil relations in the way Brasilia may have hoped, but he represents a key ideological ally for Bolsonaro. 
If Joe Biden wins, the Democrat could put the environment and human rights at the top of the bilateral agenda, complicating relations and jeopardizing trade, diplomats and analysts have told Reuters.
Americans cast votes on Tuesday in the bitterly contested presidential election. But it could be days before the result is known, especially if legal challenges focused on ballots sent by mail are accepted in the event of a tight race.
As a result, diplomats and aides have urged Bolsonaro to avoid making statements on the result, even if Trump or Biden declare themselves the victor, one of the sources said.
""The recommendation is not to say anything until we have a definitive result,"" the source said.
Prime ministers and presidents around the world are facing the same delicate question. ""We may be sitting on our hands for a while after election day,"" said the foreign policy adviser to one northern European leader.
On Tuesday, Bolsonaro met with Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo, his strategic advisor Flávio Rocha, and with his international advisor Filipe Martins to define their election result strategy.
Bolsonaro also suggested, without evidence, that there could be foreign interference both in the U.S. election, and in Brazil's 2022 vote, in which he is almost certain to seek re-election.
He wrote in a tweet that the U.S. elections ""arouse global interests... because they influence the geopolitics and projection of world power... There is always a strong suspicion of interference by other powers in the final result.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that there had so far been no indications of digital foreign interference with ballots.

Whitty said that any decision on whether to extend the lockdown, due to come into force on Thursday, would be for government, but he had faith that the public would adhere to the new restrictions.
Asked if there was a reliable chance of lockdown ending as scheduled on Dec. 2, Whitty said: ""The aim of this is to get the rates down far enough that it's a realistic possibility to move into a different state of play at that point in time.""
He told lawmakers that the lockdown could reduce the virus reproduction number below 1, but that other measures would be needed through the winter even if full lockdown ended in December.
Whitty and UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance were giving evidence to a parliamentary committee ahead of a vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposed national lockdown, due on Wednesday, which is expected to pass despite scepticism from some in Johnson's Conservative party.
Whitty and Vallance defended the models presented to the public to justify a new national lockdown, saying it was realistic to expect that deaths from the second wave from COVID could match the first unless action were taken.
Vallance pointed out that a scenario outlined in September of the possibility of reaching 200 deaths a day, for which he was heavily criticised, had come to pass.
Whitty also criticised the so-called ""Barrington Declaration"", that advocates avoiding lockdown, protecting the vulnerable and depending on ""herd immunity"" via natural infections.
""The basis for this is in my view, scientifically... dangerously flawed, operationally impractical and ... ethically a little difficult,"" Whitty said, adding herd immunity could only be achieved with a vaccine and it would not be possible to shield the vulnerable sufficiently. 

""Unfortunately these economically and socially destructive (lockdown) tools are what we've got, in the absence of anything else,"" he said.

In a video statement during a visit to Israel, Malawi Foreign Minister Eisenhower Mkaka called the decision a ""bold and significant step"".
He congratulated Israel on its budding relations with Arab and Muslim states under U.S.-brokered deals, including new ties with African country Sudan, that Israel has hailed as marking the start of a ""new era"" in the region.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said alongside Mkaka: ""I look forward to your embassy opening soon, and I'm sure that more African leaders will follow this decision.""
The embassy is expected to open by the summer of 2021, the Israeli foreign ministry said.
Asked to confirm the embassy decision, Brian Banda, an aide to Malawi President Lazarus Chakwera, said: ""Yes its going ahead, full embassy in Jerusalem.""
Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, although that is not recognised by most countries. Palestinians seek the city's east, which Israel captured in a 1967 war, as capital of a future state. 
Given the city's disputed status and sensitivity in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, most countries that have embassies in Israel have opened them in its commercial capital of Tel Aviv.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who is seeking re-election on Tuesday, enraged the Palestinians and angered many world leaders by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in late 2017. He moved the U.S. embassy there the following year.
Guatemala moved its embassy to Jerusalem soon afterwards, and Honduras has said it aims to do the same by the end of 2020. Brazil and the Dominican Republican are also considering the move.

Xi and the Central Committee, the largest of the ruling Communist Party's top decision-making bodies, concluded a four-day meeting on economic and social policy goals for the next five years last month.
It was not immediately clear to what risks Xi was referring but China faces rising tensions with the United States over issues including trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and human rights and economic shocks brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.
""At present and over the next phase, China is prone to all kinds of contradictions and risks, and the various risk factors, both foreseeable and unforeseeable, have increased significantly,"" Xi was quoted by the Xinhua state news agency as saying.
Rather than setting a numerical goal to double GDP or per capita income by 2035, China will prioritise optimising economic structure and development quality, Xi said.
However, reaching such goals is ""entirely possible"", he said, adding that China was set to declare it has achieved the goal of turning the country into a moderately prosperous society in the first half of 2021.
China is doubling down on domestic consumption and innovation, while aiming for sustained and healthy economic development, with an emphasis on a higher quality of growth, the party said in a communique last week.
China is set to narrowly miss a previous goal of doubling GDP in the decade to 2020, as the economy needs to grow at least 5.6% this year to hit that target. The economy could grow just over 2% this year.
In the party's recommendations for economic and social development, it said technological prowess would drive growth, with key projects planned in artificial intelligence, quantum information, semiconductors and other areas. 
It will encourage the merger of companies in strategic emerging industries and provide tax incentives for companies involved in basic scientific research. Development of China's sovereign digital currency will be steadily pushed forward. 
It will also support Beijing, Shanghai and the southern Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, into becoming global tech innovation centres. 
China will boost the overall competitiveness of the state economy and keep manufacturing industry's role in the economy basically stable, said the party, while reiterating its existing policy of discouraging speculation in the property market.

The change, which means an attack is now seen as highly likely, comes the day after a gunman in Vienna identified as a convicted jihadist killed four people in a rampage overnight. France has also suffered three attacks in recent weeks. 
""This is a precautionary measure following the terrible instances that we've seen in France last week, and the events that we saw in Austria last night,"" Patel said in a televised statement
She said the public should not be alarmed and that the change in threat level was not based on any specific threat.
The new threat level means an attack is highly likely, according to the government's classification system. The previous 'substantial' level meant an attack was likely.

Britain's threat level is assessed by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre which is accountable to the domestic intelligence agency MI5 and made up of representatives from 16 government departments and agencies.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's government said on Tuesday it had banned Pornhub and 190 other websites showing pornography, prompting social media anger over censorship and a protest against the decision.
Digital minister Puttipong Punnakanta said the block was part of efforts to restrict access to porn and gambling websites, which were illegal under the country's cybercrime law.
But many Thai users trended the #SavePornhub hashtag on Twitter and criticised the shutting of a site in a country that was among the Top 20 by daily traffic for Pornhub in 2019 and which has a globally-known sex industry. 
According to Pornhub, Thai users spent more time on the site last year, at 11 minutes and 21 seconds, than elsewhere in the world. 
An activist group called Anonymous Party said: ""We want to reclaim Pornhub. People are entitled to choices."" 
A few dozen activists protested the block outside the digital ministry, holding banners saying ""free Pornhub"" and ""reclaim Pornhub.""
Pornhub did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Internet research firm Top10VPN said it saw a spike in searches from Thailand for Virtual Private Networks (VPN), which help circumvent censorship, by 640% compared to the September-October daily average, after Pornhub was inaccessible from late on Monday.
Some internet users asked whether the ban was about trying to protect Thai morals, or because the site featured some compromising royal images. 
Thailand's government has faced months of youth and student-led protests demanding the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, as well as reforms to reduce King Maha Vajiralongkorn's powers.
A hashtag that translates as #HornyPower is trending on Thai Twitter following the Pornhub block, accompanied by comments or memes that the government could face greater opposition now beyond the protesters.
""If someone doesn't hate the current military government, now they probably do,"" said a Twitter user named Jirawat Punnawat.

Emilie Pradichit, director of the Manushya Foundation, which campaigns for digital rights, said the decision showed Thailand was ""a land of digital dictatorship, with conservatives in power trying to control what young people can watch, can say and can do online.""

LONDON/BERLIN (Reuters) - As Americans head to the polls, prime ministers and presidents around the world face a delicate question - when to congratulate the eventual winner, especially given the risk the election result will be contested.
On the one hand, there's a chance the popular vote will go one way and the Electoral College - which actually determines the winner - the other. Also, President Donald Trump has repeatedly alleged mail-in ballots are subject to fraud, suggested he may not accept the result and said the Supreme Court may have to decide the winner.
""You want to be prompt and clear in sending congratulations, particularly to such an important ally,"" said a foreign policy adviser to a northern European leader. 
""But it's risky this time. You don't want to get it wrong, or move too soon. We may be sitting on our hands for a while after election day.""
Foreign policy advisers recall the U.S. election in 2000, when a host of leaders - including the presidents of Germany and France, the prime minister of New Zealand and ruling parties in South Africa, South Korea and Japan - sent congratulations to George W. Bush after U.S. TV networks had declared him winner. 
It would be another five weeks before the Supreme Court ruled in his favour, finally handing him victory over Al Gore. In the meantime, some leaders withdrew their congratulations. Others just kept quiet.
The 2016 contest between Trump and Hillary Clinton produced a similarly tight finish, with Clinton winning the popular vote but Trump securing the backing of the Electoral College.
This year, Jean-Claude Juncker, former president of the European Commission, said it was critical not to send congratulations too soon.
""Caution is the mother of the transatlantic porcelain box,"" he said in an interview with Germany's ARD-TV, using a German figure of speech to convey how carefully the European Union's relationship with the United States needs handling.
The chief adviser to another European leader described the situation as ""complicated and delicate,"" saying it depended on how clear the result was, and whether both candidates accepted it. Both could claim victory, he suggested.
He also raised another diplomatic conundrum. If Biden wins, might it not be smart to call Trump to commiserate, too?
Trump remains president until Jan. 20; it would be wise to show respect.
NO CONCESSION?
In Canada, which has a wealth of border and trade links with the United States, there is a plan to dispatch congratulatory statements only once there's a clear winner - but that may not be obvious.
""We don't have a definition of what that would be, but in my mind it would mean a concession from one of the two major candidates,"" said a source in Ottawa.
""If there is no concession, we will have a lot of thinking to do. We're going to be watching closely and assessing day by day, if indeed it's an unclear or contested result.""
Britain's former ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, who quit after disparaging diplomatic cables he wrote about Trump were revealed by a newspaper, has said he hopes his former boss, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, won't make a mistake.

""I can't believe they would get dragged into commenting on a disputed election outcome,"" he told the World Review podcast. ""I hope they would just shut up and wait for events to take their turn.""

KABUL (Reuters) - As Mohammad clambered out of a second-floor window at Kabul University on Monday to escape gunmen rampaging across the campus, he was sure death was close.
Minutes earlier, the 20-year-old had been sitting in his classroom in the Afghan university's National Legal Training Centre building, waiting for a lecturer at the start of what should have been a regular Monday morning. 
Then three gunmen began shooting, killing at least 35 in an attack on unarmed young people that has shocked a country where insurgent violence is common despite peace talks between Taliban militants and the U.S.-backed government.
""Sounds of screaming, gunshots and hand grenade explosions reverberated inside the building,"" Mohammad, who asked to go by his first name, told Reuters by 'phone. ""Many lives and dreams were shattered."" 
The brazen attack has been claimed by Islamic State, a jihadist group that is an enemy of the Taliban and not part of Afghanistan's halting peace process.
The Taliban, which wants a share of power as U.S. troops withdraw after nearly 20 years of shoring up the government in Kabul, has denied involvement in Monday's massacre.
That has done little to reassure a nation where trust in the Taliban - responsible for killing thousands of civilians and government troops in recent years - is at a low ebb.
The fact that young people were specifically targeted just over a week after a suicide bomber killed 24 people - most aged between 15 and 26 - at a Kabul education centre, has only heightened the sense of anger and loss.
About a hundred students gathered near Kabul University campus on Tuesday to protest against the peace talks, which are being held in Doha.
""We want to raise our voices to the world and say we shall never give up,"" said M. Younus, one of the demonstrators. ""No matter how many they kill, we will continue our studies.""
MORNING CALM SHATTERED
The gunmen entered the building Mohammad was in - located beside an entrance to the campus - at around 11 a.m. (0630 GMT).
Officials say they are still piecing together the sequence of events. They have yet to establish whether the attackers entered the campus by force or if arms had been stored on site to be accessed after they entered the grounds.
""With the start of gunshots I looked outside and saw well-equipped men in police force uniforms running toward our building,"" said Mohammad, a third year student in the law and political science faculty.
It was not clear whether he was referring to the insurgents or security forces who engaged them in battle. In some previous militant attacks in Afghanistan, perpetrators have disguised themselves as members of the police or army.
Along with his classmates, Mohammad rushed to wedge chairs and tables in front of their classroom door to stop the attackers from entering. As the explosions and gunshots neared, the students desperately looked for a way to escape.
""Our class had windows facing the rear of the building where there are many trees; using the trees we managed to climb down,"" said Mohammad, who heard screams behind him from the building he had fled.
""I saw death coming for me, I don't know whose prayers saved me.""
FROZEN IN FEAR
A short distance away on the sprawling campus, Somaya Mohammadi, 20, had been taking notes in her Islamic Culture lecture when she looked out of the window and saw a large number of students running frantically toward the exit gate.
""One of the students shouted that suicide attackers had entered the university,"" Mohammadi, a student at the Faculty of Engineering, recalled.
There was shock and panic as she and her classmates grabbed their belongings and rushed out of the building.
Mohammadi said she froze in fear.
""I was shivering and could not walk at all ... I got out of the building with the help of my friends.""
Outside, there was chaos.
""Everyone was running ... the university was very crowded,"" said 21-year-old Niloufar Alamyar.
A third year student, Alamyar had been training to be a journalist - a difficult and dangerous job in Afghanistan. But she was not prepared for what she saw. 
""I did not think I would ever see such a scene in life,"" she said, adding that students were directed to flee via the south gate of the campus, away from where the attackers had entered and were exchanging heavy fire with security forces.
The battle continued for some six hours, according to officials.
LUCKY TO BE ALIVE
Mohammad, Mohammadi and Alamyar made it out alive, unharmed. Others were less fortunate.
Mustafa Jan witnessed classmates being killed.
""I saw an attacker pass by the classroom. When he returned, he fired into the classroom. He killed and wounded a number of my classmates and then went to other classes.""
Outside, as Mohammadi fled, she desperately tried to call her best friend Marzia, who did not respond. She was to meet Marzia after class to return a book she had borrowed. 
""Bring it tomorrow after the class,"" Marzia, who was in the final year of a public policy course, had texted the night before. The two had been friends for nine years and graduated school together.
When Marzia did not answer, Mohammadi called one of her classmates, who informed her that Marzia was dead.
""I just could not believe it,"" said Mohammadi, who stumbled across a picture of Marzia on social media laying lifeless on the floor, covered in blood.

""Marzia was very talented student, and she was top of her class,"" said Mohammadi, weeping. ""I'll miss her loud laugh and jokes. I still can't believe she is no more.""

London and Brussels are attempting to thrash out a last-minute trade deal to protect nearly a trillion dollars of trade from disruption at the start of next year when EU rules on everything from customs to pet passports will cease to apply.
Britain has ruled out delaying the end of this transition period beyond Dec. 31 despite having to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic which has sucked up government resources and presented huge unforeseen challenges for businesses.
The IfG report said there was not enough time for businesses to get ready for new trading rules, nor for the government to firm up processes for trade passing between EU member Ireland and British province Northern Ireland.
""Disruption in January is inevitable,"" said Maddy Thimont Jack, associate director at the IfG.
""At any point, this would pose a steep challenge for the government, but the pandemic makes it so much harder. Ministers will need to be prepared to make difficult decisions about where to prioritise resources come January.”

With time running out to ratify any deal, Britain and the EU have so far failed to reach agreement on three of the most persistent sticking points in their talks.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 09:11AM ET</span>","Volunteers want Christians to return to Mosul, where Islamic State once ruled","By Abdullah Rashid
MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Young volunteers have been clearing dust and debris from St. Thomas church in Mosul, as the Iraqi city occupied by Islamic State militants seeks to sweep away the horrors of a brutal three-year rule and welcome back members of minority faiths.
The Syriac Catholic church, dating from the mid-1800s, was looted by the hardline Islamist movement after it invaded Mosul in 2014 and has been abandoned ever since. The militants were finally driven out of Iraq's second largest city in 2017.
""This is a message to say 'Come back, Mosul is not complete without you',"" said Mohammed Essam, co-founder of a local volunteer group, after a day of cleaning rubble and dirt from the floors of the church and the courtyard outside.
There are still reminders of Islamic State's occupation.
The words ""Land of the Caliphate"" are painted in Arabic script on one wall, a reference to the group's ambition of carving out its own territory across the Middle East.
Until the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, about 45,000 Christians lived in Mosul, Father Raed Adel, in charge of the city's Syriac Catholic churches, told Reuters.
Their numbers kept dwindling, and the Christians who were left fled the area when Islamic State fighters took over in June, 2014.
Essam remained and witnessed atrocities committed against religious minorities by the militants.
""We want to change the perception people in the region and beyond have about Mosul,"" he explained. ""We want to say that Christians belong here. That they have a rich history here.""
Since the liberation, the ""Sawaed al-Museliya"" (Arms of Mosul) volunteer group has provided community services including emergency food support and raising funds for rebuilding homes belonging to the city's poorest residents.
By clearing up the church, they want to support the local Christian community's efforts to restore damaged properties and also reassure Christians who fled.
""Even though they left, we are committed to take care of them and of their places of worship,"" Essam said.
On the other side of the city, Father Adel holds a Sunday service in Mosul's main operating church of Bishara.
""Since the city was liberated from ISIS, there is a new mentality among people originally from Mosul, including Muslims. This encourages the return of Christians, even though it is a modest return. But it is a first step along a long path.""
Only about 50 Christian families have returned to live in the city so far, although more come to work or study each day, crossing from Iraq's northern Kurdistan region where they found refuge in 2014, Father Adel said.

""Our youth are the hope of this city after it suffered so many difficulties and problems,"" Father Adel said. ""It was in a tunnel of darkness.""

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Russia says it will consider Iranian proposal to end Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,"By Olzhas Auyezov and Nvard Hovhannisyan
BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Russia is considering an Iranian proposal for ending the conflict in the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh after three ceasefires failed to halt fighting that is now in its sixth week.
Interfax news agency quoted deputy Russian foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Iran's proposal was made by deputy foreign minister Abbas Abaqchi during a visit to Moscow last week, but gave no details.
""We're looking carefully at it,"" Rudenko told journalists.
At least 1,000 people, and possibly many more, have been killed since fighting broke out on Sept. 27 in Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.
The worst fighting in more than 25 years has underlined the influence of Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan, in the South Caucasus, a region that was once part of the Soviet Union and long dominated by Moscow, which has a defence pact with Armenia.
Russian news agencies reported last week that Iran had proposed a leading role in peace negotiations for countries in the region. Russia, it said, would be one of these countries.
Negotiations have for decades been led by Russia, France and the United States in their roles as co-chairs of a panel known as the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a security and rights watchdog.
Within hours of an agreement being reached with the warring sides on Friday not to target civilians, attacks resumed, and concerns remain about the security of oil and gas pipelines in Azerbaijan.
Advances on the battlefield have reduced Azerbaijan's incentive to reach a lasting peace deal and complicated international efforts to broker a ceasefire -- in which Turkey wants a bigger role.
FIGHTING CONTINUES
Azerbaijan's defence ministry reported combat operations on Tuesday in the Zangilan and Gubadli regions of Nagorno-Karabakh near the border with Iran, and in the Aghdere and Khojavend regions -- known by Armenia as Martakert and Martuni -- in the north and east of the conflict zone. 
Azerbaijan said its positions on the border with Armenia had been fired on with mortar bombs and small arms and that the city of Fizuli, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Iran, and surrounding villages were being shelled.
Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan denied the reported shelling of Fizuli. Armenian defence ministry official Artsrun Hovhannisyan said fighting was continuing in the eastern part of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Kamran Aliyev, Azerbaijan's prosecutor general, told Reuters in an interview that advancing Azeri troops had found an empty city in Fizuli, a large town in Soviet times.
""Our military were not even able to put a flag on anything there, because there were no buildings,"" he said in the capital, Baku, adding he would consider opening a criminal investigation into what he said had been the destruction of historical buildings.

The ethnic Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry says 1,177 of its troops have been killed since Sept. 27. Azerbaijan does not disclose its military casualties, while Russia has estimated 5,000 deaths on both sides.

The country, which fared better than many of its European peers when the pandemic broke out mainly due to an early nationwide lockdown, has reported fewer cases than most in Europe. 
But it has seen a gradual increase in infections since early October and has been reimposing restrictions. 
Some Greeks believe the new rules will hurt economic activity in a country that recently emerged from a decade-long debt crisis.

KABUL (Reuters) - The death toll from an attack on Kabul University has risen to at least 35, two government sources said on Tuesday, as students protested over the attack and the country marked a day of mourning.
Gunmen barged into the university on Monday, in what was the second attack on an educational institution in the capital in just over a week. Both have been claimed by Islamic State.
The two sources told Reuters that most of those killed were students and around 50 more people were wounded, some of them breaking limbs while jumping from windows to flee from the attack during morning classes.
Officially the death toll stands at 22 with 27 wounded, according to the interior ministry. 
The country held a day of mourning on Tuesday, with many flags flying at half mast. 
Around 100 students gathered outside the university to protest that peace talks with the insurgent Taliban in Doha were not leading to a reduction in violence.
""Although we see these kinds of attacks on a daily basis, there are still ongoing peace talks with them, which is really terrible,"" said one protesting student, Zaryab Paryani. 
The Taliban has denied any part in the attack, which follows a blast last month - also claimed by Islamic State - that killed dozens of students at a tutoring centre.
But some Afghan government officials, including First Vice President Amrullah Saleh, have accused the Taliban of involvement.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Twitter accused the government of ""taking (the) public for fools"".

Negotiators from the Afghan government and the Taliban are holding talks in Doha with the aim of brokering a peace deal as the United States withdraws troops.

In Germany, police searched 83 apartments and other buildings to seize evidence like smart phones and laptops. Prosecutors said 96 suspects are being questioned about hateful posts they made online.
One of the suspects is accused of making anti-Semitic comments while another insulted a female politician online, prosecutors in the German region of Rheinland Palatinate said in a statement.
The raids are part of an annual drive initiated by German prosecutors, joined this year for the first time by Italy, France, Greece, Norway, Britain and the Czech Republic under the coordination of Europol.
Tuesday's raids are focused on online posts that promote racism and xenophobia, a Europol spokesman said.
Germany has some of the world’s toughest laws on defamation, incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities.
A German law in force since 2018 demands that social networks delete or block obviously criminal content within 24 hours of receiving a complaint or face a hefty fine.
The legislation has been closely watched as concerns mount globally about hateful posts, but it has had a limited impact and has not stopped online hate speech in Germany, blamed for helping to fuel a wave of racist attacks in the last year.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",LGBT and religious rights collide in U.S. Supreme Court foster-care case,"By Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a case pitting LGBT rights against religious rights, the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday is set to hear arguments in a dispute over the city of Philadelphia's refusal to place children for foster care with a Catholic Church-affiliated agency that excludes same-sex couples from serving as foster parents.
It will be the first major case to be heard by President Donald Trump's conservative appointee Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed to the court last week and participated in oral arguments for the first time on Monday.
The nine justices will hear arguments in an appeal brought by Catholic Social Services, part of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which accused the city of violating the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and religion. 
A lower court ruled in 2018 that the city's anti-discrimination measures were applied uniformly, meaning the Catholic organization's religious rights were not violated and it was not entitled to an exemption.
Barrett, a devout Catholic, is a strong proponent of religious rights. The case provides her and the rest of the court's new 6-3 conservative majority a new chance to recognize broader religious rights under the Constitution, building on other rulings in recent years in that vein.
During its term that ended in July, the court cemented its reputation as a friend to Christian conservatives with a trio of rulings embracing religious exemptions to certain federal laws and paving the way for public money to go to religious schools.
Catholic Social Services, which has helped provide foster care services for more than a century, has said it would be forced to close its foster care operations if it is unable to participate in Philadelphia's program.
A ruling against Philadelphia could make it easier for people to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from widely applicable laws such as anti-discrimination statutes.
""If individual organizations can begin to choose to discriminate against whom they want to serve, then it does begin to set an unfortunate precedent,"" said Cynthia Figueroa, Philadelphia's deputy mayor for children and families. 
The Catholic agency was effectively seeking to rewrite a contract it voluntarily signed, Figueroa added.
Catholic Social Services said the city is penalizing it for its religious views and for following church teachings on marriage. 
""Philadelphia demands that a religious agency, an arm of a church, speak and act according to Philadelphia's beliefs. If it does not, Philadelphia will rid itself of the meddlesome agency,"" Mark Rienzi, a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Catholic agency, said in court papers.
The Trump administration is backing the agency in the case. 
As part of the case, Catholic Social Services is asking the court to overturn a 1990 Supreme Court ruling called Employment Division v. Smith, which was authored by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Barrett's conservative mentor.
That ruling limited the ability of people to seek exemptions from laws that apply to everyone. Congress subsequently enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which lets people bring religious claims against the federal government but not the states.
Even if the court does not go as far as to overturn the 1990 precedent, Catholic Social Services would like it to make it easier for religious entities to mount defenses when the government accuses them of violating certain types of laws.
Philadelphia in 2018 suspended foster care referrals to Catholic Social Services, which then sued alongside three foster parents.
U.S. District Judge Petrese Tucker and the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled against the Catholic group.
Eleven of the 50 states currently allow private agencies to refuse to place children with same-sex couples, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a group backing gay rights.

The Supreme Court in recent years supported LGBT rights in a series of landmark rulings including one in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide and one in June protecting gay and transgender employees from workplace discrimination.

CHENNAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Supporters of U.S. vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris held prayers near her ancestral village in India ahead of Tuesday's U.S. election, while a Hindu fringe group sought divine blessings for her rival Donald Trump.
The southern Indian region where Harris' maternal grandfather was born is rooting for the Democratic Party to win because of the family connection.
Meanwhile, a group that claims to have the support of 5 million Hindus says it wants Trump to be re-elected in order to keep India's main rivals - Pakistan and China - in check.
Hours ahead of the U.S. presidential election, people living in and around Thulasendrapuram, the village of Harris' grandfather, gathered at a temple for special prayers.
One local politician conducted an ""abhishekam"", a practice that involves pouring milk over a Hindu idol while religious verses are recited, in the presence of about 20 villagers, said R. Manikandan, a shopkeeper near the temple.
He said more than 15 cars and motorcycles, belonging to reporters working for local and international media outlets, had assembled in Thulasendrapuram to cover the ritual.
R.R. Kalidas Vandayar, a businessman and the head of a cricket association in the nearest town, plans to offer food to more than 150 people to seek their blessings for Harris, who is running alongside Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
""She is from here and we are proud of her,"" said Vandayar's brother R.R. Jayakumar Vandayar.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea is building two new submarines, including one capable of firing ballistic missiles, a South Korean lawmaker said on Tuesday, following a closed-door briefing by the South's National Intelligence Service.
North Korea has a large submarine fleet but only one known experimental submarine capable of carrying a ballistic missile.
""One of the submarines North Korea is building can carry a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM),"" Ha Tae-keung, an opposition party lawmaker on parliament’s intelligence committee, told Reuters. ""One is a modified Romeo Class and the other is a new medium-large size one.""
North Korea has been subject to U.N. Security Council sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea's demands for an end to sanctions.
In July 2019 state media showed Kim inspecting a large, newly built submarine. While North Korea did not describe the submarine’s weapons systems, analysts said the apparent size of the vessel indicated it was designed to carry missiles.
Later that year North Korea said it had successfully test-fired a new SLBM from the sea, and last month it showcased a new SLBM design during a military parade in Pyongyang. 
Kim's vow to unveil new strategic weapons this year also led to speculation that North Korea could soon deploy an operational ballistic missile submarine.
North Korea has unveiled a total of 76 intercontinental ballistic missiles in nine different types at a military parade on Oct. 10, that showcased the country’s long-range weapons for the first time in two years, Yonhap news agency reported, citing Ha.
The weapons showcased this year were the largest of all past military parades in scale, he said.
The lawmaker also said there was circumstantial evidence indicating that Kim had ordered an investigation into the North Korean troops who shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who went missing in late September, Yonhap reported.
North Korea last week said the shooting of the South Korean man in its waters last month was a self-defensive measure amid concerns about the coronavirus.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India, the United States, Japan and Australia began their largest joint naval exercises in over a decade on Tuesday, Indian government sources said, seen as part of efforts to balance China's vast military and economic power in the region.
The annual ""Malabar"" wargames that India holds with the United States and Japan have been expanded to include Australia this year to cover all members of the Quad, an informal group of the four largest democracies in the Indo-Pacific.
China has accused the United States, which has been leading the effort to forge a common front among its allies, of a ""Cold War mentality"" and ideological prejudice.
Five ships of the Indian Navy, including a submarine, were deployed in the exercise along with U.S. Navy's John S McCain missile destroyer, Australia's Ballarat frigate and a Japanese destroyer, the Indian ministry of defence said.
There will be no contact between the military personnel of the four nations because of COVID-19 restrictions during the first phase of the drills running till Nov. 6, it said. 
Later this month, India and the United States will deploy aircraft carriers in the drills, a military source said. 
""The exercise will showcase the high-levels of synergy and coordination between the friendly navies, which is based on their shared values and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order,"" the defence ministry said in its statement.
The exercises comes at a time when the host, India, is locked in a military stand-off on the disputed land border with China.
Thousands of troops are in close proximity in the western Himalayas, where India says Chinese troops have intruded across its side of the de facto border. Beijing denies any intrusion and says India has been building roads and other infrastructure in the disputed area, causing the crisis.
Australia's diplomatic relations with China also worsened this year after Canberra led calls for an international inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic and Beijing imposed trade sanctions on Australian beef and barley.

Separately, Japan is embroiled in a dispute with China over ownership of islands in the East China Sea.

IZMIR, Turkey (Reuters) - A young girl was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in the western Turkish city of Izmir on Tuesday, more than 90 hours after a deadly earthquake in the Aegean Sea killed at least 104 people.
Rescuers heard Ayda Gezgin's screams from under the rubble and managed to pull her out hours later, taking her out on a stretcher as emergency teams continued to search five apartment blocks for survivors.
Images showed a rescue worker hugging Ayda after she was found under the debris, covered in dust. Crowds in the area applauded workers after they carried away the young girl, whose age was variously given as three or four years old.
""She smiled, she was waiting for us,"" said Levent Onur, one of the rescue workers pulling Ayda out, adding the child had been stuck behind a washing machine which shielded her from injury.
""The name of our miracle after 91 hours is Ayda. Thank God,"" tweeted cabinet minister Murat Kurum.
Friday's earthquake in the Aegean Sea was the deadliest to hit Turkey in nearly a decade, with 102 people killed in Izmir and two teenagers on the Greek island of Samos, according to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD)
The quake injured 1,026 people, with 143 still receiving treatment in Izmir, AFAD said. More than 3,500 tents and 13,000 beds are being used for temporary shelters in Turkey, where relief efforts have drawn in nearly 8,000 personnel and 25 rescue dogs, the agency said. 
Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said Friday's quake had a magnitude of 6.9. There have been 1,475 aftershocks, AFAD said. 
Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. More than 500 people were killed in a 2011 quake in the eastern city of Van, while another in January this year killed 41 people in the eastern province of Elazig.
In 1999, two powerful quakes killed 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. AFAD said Friday's earthquake had a magnitude of 6.6, with some 1,400 aftershocks.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Hundreds of men and women marched, clad in T-shirts supporting U.S. President Donald Trump or pink fabric dresses bearing the image of Jesus, as they waved American flags, Republican presidential campaign signs, and even a few Nigerian flags.
The rally, after all, was in Onitsha, a city in eastern Nigeria. 
Trump has disparaged African nations, calling them ""shithole https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-immigration-trump-nigeria/nigeria-summons-representative-of-us-ambassador-over-trump-comments-idUKKBN1F424L countries"" and saying Africans would never leave the United States if allowed in. This year, he added Nigeria and five other countries when he expanded visa curbs.
But millions in Africa's most populous nation love the bombastic 45th U.S. president all the same. 
""President Trump, may we shout for joy over your victory,"" Rev. Daddy Hezekiah of the Living Christ Mission Inc., which organized the Oct. 25 rally, said in a video. 
A Pew Research Center poll in January found that 58% of Nigerians had confidence in Trump, behind only Israel, the Philippines and Kenya. A 2020 Gallup poll showed 56% of Nigerians approved of U.S. leadership, versus 24% for Europeans. 
In a posh Lagos eatery, a portrait of Trump in a gold-trimmed red agbada, a flowing robe worn by Yoruba men, hangs on the wall. The traditional clothing is a ""mark of respect"", said artist Peter Udoakang. 
""I made this painting to bring him closer to us,"" said the 23-year-old, adding that Trump's ""radical"" approach to governing appealed to Nigerians, who are used to hustling in a tough economy to survive. 
On a busy Lagos road, driver Michael Onyeonoro said if Nigeria found a similar leader, the U.S. visa troubles might not matter. 

""If we have a person like Trump...Nigeria will be a better place to stay,"" Onyeonoro said. ""There will be no need of going outside the country.""

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: International donors likely to pledge less aid for Afghanistan - sources,"By Rupam Jain and Charlotte Greenfield
(Reuters) - Afghanistan is likely to receive reduced pledges for aid from international donors gathering in Geneva next month, three sources familiar with discussions said, amid uncertainty over 
how the government's peace talks with the Taliban will progress.
Washington is hoping the intra-Afghan peace process will eventually bring the curtain down on the United States' longest war, as it plans to withdraw the remaining few thousand personnel still in Afghanistan by May.
But the withdrawal of foreign forces will leave behind a country still dependent on foreign aid, and one in which the Taliban could secure greater influence, making donors uneasy over whether the hardline Islamists will try to roll back progress made on human rights and girls education.
The Taliban did not respond to requests for comment on the concerns, and it was not known whether their representatives would be invited to the donors conference in Geneva on Nov. 23/24.
But some analysts see foreign aid as vital in helping donors shape policies of any future Afghan government.
""It's one of the primary forms of leverage the U.S. and international community believe they have over the Taliban,"" said Andrew Watkins, an analyst covering Afghanistan for International Crisis Group. ""Any future Afghan state will rely on foreign aid almost as much as the current one does."" 
The impact of the coronavirus epidemic this year has made Afghanistan's plight worse, with government revenues sinking, and unemployment and poverty projected to rise dramatically.
Yet, donors are likely to tell Afghanistan to expect, possibly significantly, less aid, while also imposing stricter conditions and committing funds for a shorter period, said the three sources, who declined to be named because the discussions are private.
All three sources said the United States, Afghanistan's largest donor, is likely to make deep cuts to its current annual contribution of around $800 million for civilian funding, beyond the money allocated for defence and security needs.
One said Washington could not only ""cut aid by half"", but could also move ""away from a four-year-commitment cycle"" to pledge funds for just a year.
Other NATO members like Britain and France were also considering reducing pledges, while Australia was planning cuts of up to 30%, two sources said.
The U.S. State Department and Australia's department of foreign affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. France's Embassy in Kabul declined to comment and the British Foreign Office did not respond to questions around its plans on aid pledges.
SWITCHING TO ANNUAL REVIEWS
Dozens of donor nations and multilateral institutions have met every four years to pledge the billions of dollars that fund roughly three-quarters of the Afghan government's budget. 
The aid is largely pledged to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), a World Bank managed fund that finances vital national priority programs in a country where the United States has been fighting for 19 years.
At the last donor conference in Brussels four years ago, donors pledged $15.2 billion in aid to support Afghanistan between 2017-2020, an equivalent to $3.8 billion per year.
A spokesman at Afghanistan's finance ministry said it was premature to comment on aid figures, but the government did not expect any reductions in pledges.
Finland's foreign minister Pekka Haavisto, whose government is co-organising the Geneva meeting, said one major change will be a switch to reviewing funding annually, rather every four years.
He said ""strict conditions"" would be applied during reviews to address donor concerns about corruption, and to safeguard progress made on rights issues since U.S. backed forces ousted a Taliban government in 2001.

""The donor community don't want to lose the achievements of the last 19 years,"" Haavisto told Reuters. ""The best answer has been yearly check-ups and clear conditionality.""

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",Khamenei says Iran's U.S. policy not affected by who wins election,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday the U.S. presidential election's result will not impact Tehran's policy towards Washington.
""Our policy towards the United States is clearly set and does not change with the movement of individuals. It does not matter to us who comes and goes,"" Khamenei said in a speech carried live on state TV.
Khamenei was speaking on the anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, which coincided with the birthday of Islam's Prophet Mohammad.
""The students' attack on this den of spies was quite appropriate and wise,"" Khamenei said, referring to radical Islamist students who stormed the embassy, taking hostage 52 staff for an eventual 444 days. There have been no U.S.-Iranian diplomatic relations since.
Iran this year cancelled rallies and other events marking the embassy seizure because of concerns over the spread of the coronavirus which has killed about 36,000 people in the country, the worst hit in the Middle East.
The Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, has pledged to rejoin Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers if Iran returns to compliance with it.
In 2018 President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, under which Iran international financial sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs to its nuclear programme. Iran followed Washington's rejection by reducing its compliance.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told U.S. network CBS on Monday that he wants the United States to rejoin the accord, but that ""re-engagement does not mean renegotiation"" because ""if we wanted to do that [renegotiate], we would have done it with President (Donald) Trump four years ago.""
Zarif told CBS that ""the statements by the Biden camp have been more promising, but we will have to wait and see"".

Trump has said he wants to strike a broader accord that would also address Iran's missile programme and regional activities. Iran has ruled out any negotiations unless Washington first returns to the agreement.

Federal District Judge Robert Summerhays sentenced Holden Matthews to 25 years but gave him 18 months credit for the time he has already spent in jail. 
Matthews, who will serve 282 months, had admitted to burning down three predominantly African American churches and pleaded guilty to both state and federal charges in February.
The judge also ordered him to pay about $2.7 million in restitution to the churches he burned. 
Matthews had burnt three churches - St. Mary Baptist Church, Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church - over a 10-day span in 2019. The three churches, all in St. Landry Parish, burned down between March 26 and April 4.
Matthews was arrested and charged with three counts of simple arson on religious buildings and three hate crimes charges.
Authorities said back then that Matthews had ""a relationship with a type of music called black metal,"" an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. Black metal has an association with church burnings in other parts of the world, they said.
The judge said on Monday that even though Matthews' acts were not driven by race, they brought back fears to a ""dark time in history"". 

The judge was referencing the time when Black churches were burned by white supremacists during the civil rights movement.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Gunmen attacked six locations in central Vienna on Monday starting outside the main synagogue, killing two people and injuring at least 14 in what Austria called a ""repulsive terror attack"" while hunting one or more assailants on the loose.
Witnesses described the men firing into crowds in bars with automatic rifles, as many people took advantage of the last evening before a nationwide curfew was introduced because of COVID-19. Police shot and killed one assailant.
Police sealed off much of the historic centre of Vienna, urging the public to shelter in place. Many sought refuge in bars and hotels, while public transport throughout the old town was shut down and police scoured the city.
""It is the hardest day for Austria in many years. We are dealing with a terror attack the severity of which, thank God, we have not experienced in Austria in many years,"" Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told a news conference. 
Austria's capital had so far been spared the kind of deadly militant attacks that have struck Paris, London, Berlin and Brussels, among others, in recent years. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the ""repulsive"" act was ""definitely a terror attack"", but he could not say what the motive was.
Oskar Deutsch, the head of Vienna's Jewish community, which has offices adjoining the synagogue on a narrow cobbled street dotted with bars, said on Twitter https://twitter.com/DeutschOskar/status/1323409412812398592?s=20 that it was not clear whether the temple or offices were targeted but that they were closed at the time.
Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister told London's LBC radio he was living in the compound of the synagogue. ""Upon hearing shots, we looked down (from) the windows and saw the gunmen shooting at the guests of the various bars and pubs,"" he said. 
""The gunmen were running around and shooting at least 100 rounds or even more in front of our building,"" he said.
Border checks were being reinforced, the Interior Ministry said, and children would not be required to attend school on Tuesday. Although people were urged to stay indoors Vienna Mayor Michael Ludwig told broadcaster ORF the city would run normally on Tuesday, albeit with a tougher police presence.
MANHUNT
""According to what we currently know, at least one perpetrator is still on the run,"" Nehammer said.
""We have brought several special forces units together that are now searching for the presumed terrorists. I am therefore not limiting it to an area of Vienna, because these are mobile perpetrators,"" Nehammer earlier told ORF.
Kurz said the army would protect sites in the capital so the police could focus on anti-terror operations. Speaking to ORF, he said the attackers ""were very well equipped with automatic weapons"" and had ""prepared professionally"".
Videos circulated on social media of a gunman running down a cobblestone street shooting and shouting. One showed a man gunning down a person outside what appeared to be a bar on the street housing the synagogue. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.
Condolences poured in from around the world, with top officials from the European Union, France, Norway, Greece and the United States expressing their shock at the attacks.
President Emmanuel Macron of France, which has seen two deadly knife attacks in Paris and Nice in recent weeks, issued a statement expressing shock and sorrow.
""This is our Europe,"" he said. ""Our enemies must know with whom they are dealing. We will not retreat.""
French officials have ramped up security since the attacks in Paris and Nice, which had suspected Islamist motives. Macron has deployed thousands of soldiers to protect sites such as places of worship and schools, and ministers have warned that other Islamist militant attacks could take place.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet that ""our prayers are with the people of Vienna after yet another vile act of terrorism in Europe.""
""These evil attacks against innocent people must stop. The U.S. stands with Austria, France, and all of Europe in the fight against terrorists, including radical Islamic terrorists.""
Austrian officials have not released any details about the attackers or the potential motive for the Vienna attack, although Kurz said an anti-Semitic motive could not be ruled out. 
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden condemned what he called a ""horrific terrorist attack,"" adding, ""We must all stand united against hate and violence.""
In 1981, two people were killed and 18 injured during an attack by two Palestinians at the same Vienna synagogue. In 1985, a Palestinian extremist group killed three civilians in an attack at the airport.

Nehammer is due to hold a news conference on the situation at 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) on Tuesday.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 09:40PM ET</span>",Factbox: What's new in China's 2020 population survey versus 2010 census,"BEIJING (Reuters) - More than 1 billion Chinese citizens will participate in a once-in-a-decade census that will inform policymakers on demographic shifts in the world's most-populous but fast-ageing nation, and help shape social and economic policies in the years to come. 
Over 7 million census takers began going door to door on Sunday to collect information ranging from car ownership to whether they have family members in Hong Kong or Taiwan. Authorities will publish the survey results in April. 
Below are some changes in the way the census is being conducted compared with the 2010 survey, to reflect a wealthier and older population: 
LONGER SURVEY
Census takers, instead of pen and paper, are armed with smartphones and computer tablets. While that may increase the accuracy of data collection, it does not shorten the survey window, which will last more than a month, ending on Dec. 10. The 2010 census took only 10 days. 
The number of questions have increased to 19 from 18 previously. Also, 10% of the population will be selected afterwards to answer 48 questions in a second questionnaire, compared with 45 previously.
IDENTITY CARD NUMBER
Identity card numbers are logged for the first time, electronically linking the information collected to identifiable individuals. Officials have said the ID card details are to be matched with data recorded by the police and health services and other authorities to ensure accuracy. They pledged that the information will be kept strictly confidential, and will not be used for any other purpose beyond the survey. 
HONG KONG & TAIWAN
For the first time, survey respondents must disclose the number of family members who are residents in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or are now foreign nationals. No other details on those family members are being asked. 
RISING RENTS
In the longer questionnaire, respondents are asked to indicate the amount of rent they pay each month. The top bracket is ""10,000 yuan or higher"" ($1,495). That's much higher than the highest tier of ""3,000 yuan or higher"" in the 2010 census, reflecting the sharp increase in property values in the past decade in China and the higher cost of living. 
CAR OWNERSHIP
Also in the second questionnaire, respondents are asked for the first time to indicate if they own cars. They are to additionally disclose the overall value of all the cars they own, pointing to the increased private wealth created in the past 10 years. No other assets, such as the number of properties owned, are required to be divulged.
LAND RIGHTS
In the past, respondents were asked if they hold urban or rural residency permits under a decades-old ""hukou"" household registration system. In this year's census, respondents are simply asked if they hold management rights to rural land, reflecting Beijing's renewed focus on rural land resources and their utilisation. All rural land is owned by local collectives, not the state. Farmers have the right to use land owned by their local collective under long-term contracts, and can lease out the management of their land to others if they wish. 
THE AGED
In the 2010 census, citizens aged 60 and above were asked to describe their general health. For the first time, this year, they are additionally asked about their living situation - whether they are living alone, with a partner, with their children or in an institution. China is facing what experts call a ""demographic time-bomb"", following a decades-long one-child policy, which was finally abandoned in 2016. In 2018, almost a fifth of Chinese citizens were aged 60 and over, or 249 million people.

It was the first court appearance in Wisconsin for Kyle Rittenhouse since he was ordered extradited from Illinois on Friday.
Presiding over the hearing, Kenosha County Commissioner Loren Keating said that a ""very significant cash bond is necessary to assure this defendant's appearance in court, as the court does believe that he is a flight risk."" 
Rittenhouse's attorney, Mark Richards, argued for lower bail, saying that his client's unsuccessful attempt to turn himself in to Kenosha police during the street disturbances where the killings took place, suggest he would not flee.
Rittenhouse, 17, returned to his home in Antioch, Illinois, that night and was taken into custody in Lake County soon after.
Victims' advocates, including John Huber, the father of Anthony Huber, one of the people Rittenhouse is charged with killing, argued for higher bail, saying that militia groups are raising money for him and would help him escape.
Should he be released, Keating also barred Rittenhouse from possessing any weapons. 
Wearing an orange face mask during the online hearing, Rittenhouse said only ""yes, sir"" and ""yes,"" when Keating asked him a number of procedural questions. His next hearing was set for Dec. 3. He has not yet entered a plea. 

Rittenhouse was charged with first-degree reckless homicide and five other criminal counts related to the shootings, which occurred on Aug. 25 in Kenosha during civil unrest sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

(Reuters) - A Mississippi legislator and veteran Congressman are seeking criminal charges after Reuters exposed previously unreported details in the 2018 death of inmate Harvey Hill at the Madison County Detention Center.
The 36-year-old died in May 2018 after a violent altercation with guards. His family believes he was suffering an emotional breakdown when he lashed out, striking a guard with a lunch tray. Guards kicked and punched Hill, then slammed him into a concrete wall, previously unpublished jail surveillance video obtained by Reuters showed.
They led him to a shower, away from the cameras, and beat him again, still handcuffed, a state investigation found. Hill was taken to an isolation cell and later died. An autopsy ruled the death a homicide.
“If they have evidence that shows this was a murder, they need to charge those individuals,” said Democratic state lawmaker Chris Bell. “I just don’t understand what’s the holdup.”
State authorities have been investigating Hill’s death, but no one has been charged. The guards say Hill was combative and their response justified under the jail's use-of-force policy.
The Hill family attorney, Carlos Moore, said the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division has been examining the circumstances of the death. Reached for comment, a spokesperson told Reuters: “DOJ does not comment on ongoing investigations.”
The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation investigated the death in 2018, but the district attorney has taken no formal action. Neither the bureau nor the district attorney responded to Reuters requests for comment.
Representative Bell said he is “at a loss for words” why no charges have come. “There needs to be something done immediately,” he said.
Calls for action are also coming from Capitol Hill. Democratic U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, the senior member of Mississippi’s congressional delegation, reviewed Reuters’ findings on inmate deaths, including Hill’s. “Justice demands that Harvey Hill’s murderers be charged and held accountable,” Thompson said.
The Reuters investigation into Hill’s death was part of a larger examination that exposed how thousands of people are dying in America’s jails before getting their day in court. Many, like Hill, arrested on a trespassing charge, were held on minor charges.
To read the full investigation, Dying Inside, click https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-deaths
As part of its nationwide examination, Reuters found 58 people died among 11 large Mississippi jails over more than a decade. Of those, at least 39 were not convicted of the charges they faced. Seven of the inmate deaths were ruled a homicide.
Mississippi is among 17 states with no official standards or oversight mechanisms for local jails, Reuters found.
“Anytime there is a death or murder or police brutality, transparency is a must,” said Corey Wiggins, executive director of the Mississippi chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. “In this case, you had someone who was essentially killed while in custody. It’s why criminal justice has to be reformed.”
Wiggins said he will use Hill’s death to draw attention to systemic problems in local jails and will work with state and local leaders to enact reforms.
Hill’s family has also been pressing for legal action. “If nothing is done about them killing him, then it could happen to someone else,” said Cassandra Hill, his younger sister.
A wrongful death lawsuit filed by Hill’s family has settled with the sheriff’s department and the jail’s medical contractor, Quality Correctional Health Care, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The sheriff and the company did not respond to requests for comment about the settlement.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara edged closer to claiming a landslide election victory, partial tallies showed on Monday, though opponents said his bid for a third term was illegal and the results were skewed by an opposition boycott.
The president has been named winner of all constituencies announced so far, most with more than 90% of the vote, after a bitter presidential vote marred by deadly violence.
Two major opposition candidates on the ballot had asked supporters not to take part in Saturday's election, in protest at Ouattara's decision to run. Their parties said whole swathes of the country had not participated.
Ivory Coast's constitution allows presidents to stand for two terms. Ouattara says the approval of a new constitution in 2016 restarted his mandate, which the opposition disputes.
Opposition activists say his decision to seek a third term was a further blow to democracy in West Africa less than three months after a military coup in neighbouring Mali.
The Carter Center, which monitored the election, said the political and security situation made it difficult to organise a credible vote. 
""The electoral process excluded a large number of Ivorian political forces and was boycotted by part of the population in a volatile security environment,"" it said in a statement. 
The opposition candidates who boycotted the vote - former President Henri Konan Bedie and ex-Prime Minister Pascal Affi N'Guessan - have said they will not recognise a Ouattara victory.
In a joint statement on Monday evening, the opposition said they have created a transitional council presided by Bedie.
""The council will have a mission to prepare the framework for a credible and transparent presidential election. It will name a government in the coming hours,"" N'Guessan said in a news conference.
The country's commercial capital Abidjan was calm during the election and the days that followed. 
Inland, however, more sporadic violence broke out Saturday as youths clashed in opposition strongholds, killing at least five people. Cocoa farmers said they were staying away from their plantations due to insecurity.

The electoral commission has released nearly 50% of the results, with more due later on Monday.

An inventory found that most of the differences between the books and the actual stocks of the elite troops could be explained by accounting errors, a report sent to parliament by armed forces head General Eberhard Zorn on Monday showed.
About 29,000 of 48,000 missing pieces of ammunition, fuses and detonating cord have been accounted for, according to the document.
Evidence also suggested that the missing 62 kilograms of explosives never existed, according to the report. They appeared to be the result of staff mistakenly counting more explosives than were actually kept in stock.
The army leadership found in the course of an investigation into Germany's elite KSK special forces that huge amounts of ammunition and explosives handed out to the forces appeared to have gone missing.
In May, police seized weapons, explosives and ammunition during a raid on the private property of a KSK soldier in the eastern state of Saxony.
In July, Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer disbanded one of the four KSK commando companies in a bid to purge the unit of far-right extremist sympathisers.
Established in 1996, the KSK's reputation was tarnished in 2003 when its then-commander was forced into early retirement after being accused of being close to far-right extremists - links that have continued to dog the unit's reputation since.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - A wave of COVID-19 lockdowns and curbs has stirred resistance across Europe, with the right-wing British politician who helped force an EU referendum harnessing popular anger at a new lockdown by recasting his Brexit Party under a new banner.
Britain, which has the highest official death toll in Europe from COVID-19, is grappling with more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day and scientists have warned the ""worst-case"" scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended a second lockdown in England from critics who said it was either unnecessary or too late, arguing now was the time to prevent a ""medical and moral disaster"".
""We are fighting a disease... When the data changes of course we must change course too,"" he told parliament.
Cast by his supporters as the godfather of the movement to quit the European Union, Brexit Party founder Nigel Farage said Johnson had terrified Britons into submission with a second lockdown.
""The single most pressing issue is the government's woeful response to coronavirus,"" Farage and Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice said in a joint article in the Daily Telegraph, announcing his Reform UK party.
Instead of a lockdown, Farage proposed targeting those most at risk and said people should not be criminalised for trying to live normal lives such as meeting family for Christmas.
France, Germany, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands and other countries have announced second lockdowns or strict new curbs as infections surge.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said now was the time for world leaders to act.
""This is another critical moment for action,"" Tedros said. ""Another critical moment for leaders to step up. And another critical moment for people to come together for a common purpose. Seize the opportunity, it's not too late.""
Tedros was addressing a WHO news briefing in Geneva from self-isolation at home after announcing on Twitter that he had been in contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
Small shopkeepers in France, which reported a daily record 52,518 new COVID-19 infections on Monday, have complained about being forced to close while supermarkets are allowed to sell ""non-essential goods"" such as shoes, clothes, beauty products and flowers because they also sell food.
MERRY CHRISTMAS? HAPPY NEW YEAR?
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday French supermarkets would face the same limits on selling non-essential goods but shopowners were not allowed to challenge the lockdown, in place until at least Dec. 1.
""I am not optimistic that in just four weeks we will lower the number of new cases to the level announced by the president (5,000 new cases per day),"" said epidemiologist Dominique Castigliola, director of research at the National Institute of Health and Medical Research.
""We will need more time. I don’t think we’ll be able to hold big family meals at Christmas. That seems very unlikely to me.""
Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be no big New Year parties in Germany, but families should be able to get together for Christmas. 
""Throughout the winter months, we will have to limit private contacts,"" she told a news conference. ""The light at the end of the tunnel is still quite a long way off.""
Police in the Spanish capital, Madrid, on Sunday raided 81 illegal parties, 18 drinking sessions known in Spain as ""botellones"", and 10 bars which broke COVID-19 curbs.
Protests flared against new restrictions across Italy last week, with violence reported in Milan and Turin. Italy will tighten restrictions but is holding back from a lockdown, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Monday.
Italy's daily tally of infections has increased 10-fold over the last month.
More than 46.37 million people have been infected globally and over 1.2 million have died from the respiratory disease, according to a Reuters tally. The United States, which holds a presidential election on Tuesday, leads the world with more than 9 million cases and 230,700 deaths.
WHO technical lead for COVID-19 Maria Van Kerkhove said the latest spike in infections was stretching health services.
""One of challenges that we are seeing across North America, across Europe, is that the increases in cases, the increases in hospitalisation, the increases in ICU admissions are happening at the same time,"" she told the Geneva briefing.
""In the spring there was some staggering of this. But it's happening in many countries at the same time, where many systems are becoming overwhelmed at the same time.""
World shares recovered from one-month lows as strengthening factory data in China and Europe offset news of lockdowns, while investors prepared for more volatility arising from the U.S. election.
U.S. President Donald Trump has continually downplayed the virus, mocking Democratic challenger Joe Biden for wearing a mask and social distancing at campaign rallies, a tactic which enlivens his base supporters but infuriates his opponents.
Trump has also ridiculed his top coronavirus task force adviser, Anthony Fauci, who has contradicted Trump's assertions that the U.S. fight against the virus is ""rounding the turn"".

The United States reported 67,862 new cases on Sunday, the highest number it has reported on the last day of any week.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Artillery strikes on civilians in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict could amount to war crimes, the U.N. human rights chief said on Monday, reiterating a call for Azerbaijan and Armenia to halt attacks on towns, schools and hospitals in the mountain enclave.
Separately, Armenia's prime minister called for an investigation into the presence of ""foreign mercenaries"" in Nagorno-Karabakh after ethnic Armenian forces said they had captured two fighters from Syria.
Azerbaijan denied the presence of foreign combatants.
Fierce battles continued along the front line of a conflict that has killed at least 1,000 people, and possibly many more. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said indiscriminate attacks in populated areas in and around the conflict zone contravened international humanitarian law.
She said in a statement that repeated calls for both Armenia and Azerbaijan to avoid the loss of civilian life and damage to civilian infrastructure had gone unheeded.
""Instead, homes have been destroyed, streets reduced to rubble, and people forced to flee or seek safety in basements,"" she said. ""Such attacks must stop and those responsible for carrying them out, or ordering them, must be held to account.""
Just hours after agreeing in Geneva on Friday to avoid the deliberate targeting of civilians, Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh accused each other once more of shelling residential areas.
Citing data from both sides of the conflict, Bachelet said about 40,000 Azeris had been temporarily displaced by the latest fighting while some 90,000 ethnic Armenians had fled Nagorno-Karabakh and were currently in Armenia.
International rights groups have also accused both sides of using banned cluster munitions, most recently in the shelling of the Azeri city of Barda on Wednesday.
FOREIGN FIGHTERS
Armenia's foreign ministry said the Artsakh Defence Army, its name for the ethnic Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh, had captured two Syrian combatants over the weekend, one from Idlib province and the other from Hama.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that the involvement of ""foreign mercenaries"" was ""a threat not only to the security of Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia but also to international security and this issue should become a subject of international investigation.""
Asked about foreign fighters, Azeri presidential aide Hikmet Hajiyev said: ""We reject such allegations.""
The Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry said fierce battles took place along parts of the front line on Monday and that it had repelled an Azeri platoon. A spokesman for the ministry said a deputy commander in the Artsakh army was killed in combat.
Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said artillery fire killed one civilian and wounded two in the country's southern Syunik region.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said it had repelled an attack on its positions in the high ground of the Zangilan district, between the enclave and the Iranian border, while army units in the Gazakh, Tovuz and Dashkesan regions also came under fire.

Azeri President Ilham Aliyev wrote on Twitter that Azerbaijan had retaken a further eight settlements in Zangilan, Gubadli and Jabrayil regions.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Four Thai activists, including protest leader and rights lawyer Arnon Nampa, were freed early on Tuesday and promised to keep fighting to oust Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and for reforms to the monarchy.
The activists were among dozens arrested during emergency measures imposed last month to try to end months of protests, but which backfired by drawing tens of thousands of people onto the streets of Bangkok.
The four were freed after a court ruled that police had reached the limit for detaining them. They still face public order and other charges relating to the protests.
""We are out and ready to fight again,"" Arnon said after being released from Bangkok Remand Prison, where hundreds of supporters had gathered.
Arnon broke a longstanding taboo on criticising the monarchy in August when he was the first to openly call for reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Also among those released were Ekachai Hongkangwan and Suranat Paenprasert, who face rarely used charges of violence against the queen over an incident in which Queen Suthida's royal motorcade was jeered when it unexpectedly arrived where protesters had gathered.
The charges can carry the death penalty if the queen's life is thought to have been threatened and in other cases between 16 years and life imprisonment for those found guilty. 
All have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.
As well as reforms to the monarchy, protesters seek to change the constitution and demand the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth, a former junta leader they accuse of engineering last year's election to keep power that he seized in a 2014 coup. He says that vote was fair and he will not quit.

The Palace has made no comment since the start of the protests, but on Sunday the king told Britain's Channel 4 news ""we love them all the same"" of the protesters and ""Thailand is a land of compromise"".

ABUJA (Reuters) - ""Hoodlums"" wearing military uniforms may have shot Nigerian protesters campaigning against police brutality and it was too soon to tell if soldiers were involved, the country's attorney general said on Monday.
Demonstrations across the country turned violent on Oct. 20 when witnesses in Lagos said the military opened fire on peaceful protesters in the upmarket Lekki district shortly after local authorities imposed a 24-hour curfew, drawing international condemnation.
Soldiers and police killed at least 12 people in two Lagos neighbourhoods on Oct. 20, according to witnesses and rights group Amnesty International. The army and police have denied involvement.
Attorney General Abubakar Malami told reporters in the capital, Abuja, the matter was being investigated and there was a need to establish whether the shooting took place, who was responsible and whether the people who were shooting were part of the military.
""You cannot rule out the possibility of perhaps hoodlums that set in to create a scene... could equally partake in the process,"" Malami said at the news conference, which was also attended by government officials including the defence minister and finance minister. 
He also said it was ""pre-emptive"" to conclude that there had even been a shooting.
Lagos state has ordered an investigation into the incident.
Last week the military said the Lagos state government asked the army to intervene to restore order, but soldiers did not shoot civilians.
Nationwide protests against alleged human rights abuses by police sparked some of Nigeria's worst street violence since it returned to civilian rule in 1999. Police last week said 22 of its personnel were killed in the violence and 205 police stations were damaged.

The unrest, which has largely died down, has posed the biggest political challenge faced by President Muhammadu Buhari since he took office in 2015.

PARIS (Reuters) - Schools across France held a minute's silence on Monday in memory of Samuel Paty, the teacher beheaded by a Chechen teenager who wanted to avenge his use of cartoons mocking the Prophet Mohammad during a class on freedom of expression.
With France at its highest security level following further attacks since Paty's killing on Oct. 16, some 12 million pupils returned to school for the first time since the 47-year-old was slain in broad daylight on the eve of a two-week school holiday. 
President Emmanuel Macron cast the killing as an attack on French values and the Republic itself. But his insistence that France will not compromise on basic freedoms of belief and expression has provoked an outcry among Muslims worldwide.
""The idea of terrorism is to create hatred,"" Macron wrote in a message to schoolchildren on social media. ""We will pull through this together.""
Around the country, pupils stood in silence at 11 a.m. while teachers were told to allow time to answer questions about Paty's killing.
""My students needed to offload what was on their minds,"" said Isabelle Leborgn, a high school teacher in western France. 
The attack and national soul-searching that ensued had confused many youngsters, she said. ""Some think it's the fault of a religion. There are many things to reflect on.""
The attack on Paty, as well as one in a church in Nice and another on a preacher in Lyon in the two weeks that followed, have left France on edge. The government has said more attacks are likely.
""It's always in the back of your head that we live in a society where there is a potential risk,"" said Clement, a student at the school where Leborgn teaches. ""But we cannot always live in fear."" 
""THEY ARE TRYING TO DIVIDE US""
France has deployed extra soldiers to protect places of worship and schools following the recent attacks.
Paty's macabre murder convulsed secular France, where the separation of church and state is fiercely defended by many citizens of all faiths. It also exposed the fault lines cleaving a country where some Muslims see the government's use of secular laws as a tool to suppress their expression of religious belief.
One group of Muslim leaders on Monday issued a statement defending France's strict adherence to secularism - known as laicite - and condemning violence carried out in the name of Islam.
""Laicite is essential to allowing different religions including Islam to flourish in France,"" the leaders said. They denounced those who they said manipulated fellow Muslims into believing they were suffering at the hands of a racist state.
""These people are trying to divide us and sew discord,"" they continued.
Macron has enraged Muslims around the globe by describing Islam as ""a religion in crisis all over the world"" and defending free speech that some deem blasphemous or inflammatory.
On Monday, thousands protested outside the French embassy in Jakarta carrying banners calling Macron the ""real terrorist"". 
In Bangladesh, supporters of the Islamic group Hefazat-e-Islam (Protectors of Islam) used their shoes to beat on a poster of Macron as thousands marched on the embassy in Dhaka.

Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will travel to Niger, Egypt and Morocco over the next week as part of efforts to defuse tensions, diplomatic sources said.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>","Two thirds of Slovaks joined widely-watched blanket COVID test, 1% positive","By Radovan Stoklasa and Jan Lopatka
TRENCIN, Slovakia (Reuters) - More than 3.6 million Slovaks - two thirds of the population - took part in a widely-watched nationwide coronavirus testing programme over the weekend, Prime Minister Igor Matovic said on Monday.
The scheme to test the bulk of a country in two days is being studied by other nations looking for ways to slow the virus and avoid overwhelming their health systems.
A total of 38,359 people or 1.06% of those who took part tested positive and must quarantine, Matovic told a news conference. 
""I deeply believe that this solution will work in Slovakia on the condition that those who received certification that they are negative will continue to act responsibly, and those who got a positive result will remain in quarantine with their families,"" he added. 
The premier has been pushing the programme as a decisive way to slow the spread of the virus and avoid a widespread lockdown.
It has faced opposition from some experts who say the antigen tests that Slovakia used - quicker but less accurate than standard PCR tests - are better suited for targeted programmes and need to run with other measures.
Matovic said the government was aware of those concerns but felt that even a 50% success rate in revealing infected people would help. 
The weekend's results showed that infection rates had dropped substantially in four districts where a pilot round was held a week ago, he added.
Children up to the age of 10 were exempt and testing was voluntary for others - but people who chose not to take part must go into quarantine.
""We had to have the test done, otherwise we would not get in here ... unfortunately it is what it is,"" said Patrik Kvasovec, a customer at the Laugaricio shopping centre in Trencin, north of Bratislava. 

Compared with other parts of Europe, Slovakia recorded relatively few cases after the pandemic started spreading in March but infections have soared in recent weeks. The government has warned the increase could overwhelm hospitals.

1342,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 12:12PM ET</span>","Ravaged by first wave, Italy ill-prepared as second COVID assault hits","By Giselda Vagnoni, Elvira Pollina and Emilio Parodi
ROME (Reuters) - One month ago, the World Health Organization posted a video praising Italians’ “strong and effective response” to the coronavirus pandemic.
At the time, Italy had one of the lowest infection rates in the Western world and appeared to have learnt the lessons of the first wave, which killed more people than anywhere else in Europe except Britain.
Now it appears that Italy, ahead of the rest of Europe when COVID-19 arrived, was simply behind the curve when it roared back as summer ended. New cases are rising at record rates, hitting 31,758 on Oct. 31 against around 2,500 at the start of the month, while deaths are up tenfold to more than 200 a day.
To be sure, many northern hemisphere countries are also facing a coronavirus resurgence. But just as Italy became a symbol of the perils of the virus, so its inability to protect against a second wave has underscored Europe’s failure to use the summer lull to bolster its defences, notably in tracing and testing.
""It is a monumental debacle. The fact that Italy is in the same situation as other countries in Europe is no comfort to me,"" virologist Andrea Crisanti told Reuters. ""We had five months to strengthen our surveillance, tracking and prevention systems and instead we are heading towards a new lockdown.”
The government says it wants to avoid another national lockdown and denies failing to anticipate a second wave.
""There may have been mistakes, you can always do better but we have not underestimated the situation. We have worked on all fronts,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said last week.
Crisanti, who has become a celebrity with his dogged demands for more testing, published a letter with nine colleagues on Friday listing what they said were the government's failings, along with recommendations.
One shortcoming, they said, was the system Italy had adopted to trace those who had contact with COVID sufferers and make sure they were tested. 
In June, the government employed 9,000 people for this. That has risen to just 9,200, a third of the number Germany employs. The state placed adverts last week to recruit another 2,000.
""We warned the authorities from the very beginning that we would have needed much more people, and people professionally trained, for tracing COVID-19,"" said Miria De Santis, head of the national association of health assistants.
""I think the authorities overlooked the risk of the second wave,"" she told Reuters.
PRIVACY PROBLEMS
Franco Locatelli, a leading member of the scientific committee that advises the government, denies the state lowered its guard, but acknowledges that the tracing system has been overwhelmed.
""COVID-19 tracking and testing is absolutely crucial but beyond a certain number of infections, it cracks. I meet 20, 30 people every day, the incubation period of the disease is 2, 3 days. With the current numbers, it means 700,000 people must be traced (each day). No matter how much you strengthen the system, you can't do it,"" he said last week. 
Another element was meant to be a smartphone app to track infections. As in most of Europe, Italy's app has not performed well. 
Since its launch five months ago, 9.5 million people have downloaded it, about 16% of the population. So far, 2,192 users have registered as having coronavirus – 20 times fewer than expected given the national infection rate. 
Italy and other European countries have put strong emphasis on protecting app users' privacy, with the software registering when people come close to each other, but not where they are.
""The task force of experts set up by the Italian government recommended from the start using software able to geolocate detections, because it was reckoned essential to know, for instance, if someone got infected in a nursing home,"" said Carlo Alberto Carnevale Maffe, a professor at Milan's Bocconi University and a government adviser on tracing.
China and South Korea did this and have beaten back the virus. Italy chose the less intrusive route.
""Europe has not learnt the lesson coming from the East, that public health must be addressed collectively and not individually,"" Maffe told Reuters. 
'NAVIGATING BLIND' 
In another failing, local regions, which have autonomy over health care, have yet to set up a comprehensive testing system. 
Around 200,000 swabs are being carried out daily, much more than in March, but Crisanti, who is professor of microbiology at Padua University, believes 400,000 are needed. He said he wrote to the government in August urging it to ramp up capacity, but got no reply.
The Health Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
The lack of data has fuelled public anger as the government imposes restrictions by shutting gyms, pools, theatres and cinemas, and ordering bars and restaurants to close at 6 p.m.
Business owners have challenged authorities to produce evidence that these are activities where infections are raging. For the first time there have been clashes in cities across Italy between police and people protesting against the curbs.

""We are navigating blind because no one thought to turn on the radar. The radar is the data ... which, if used wisely, should have been telling us where infections are happening,"" said Antonella Viola, an immunologist at Padua University.

Mindful of the economic pain caused by stricter measures in the spring, Switzerland's federal government has charted a different course from neighbours France and Germany in reaction to surging case numbers, seeking to avoid heavy lockdowns.
However, Geneva plans to go further as new COVID cases exceed 1,000 per day in a canton of 500,000 - one of the highest rates of infection by population density in Europe. The canton of Neuchatel will adopt similar measures on Wednesday.
In a sign of the deteriorating situation, the Geneva-based World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Sunday that he had been identified as the contact of a COVID-19 positive person.
Gatherings have been limited to five people from 1800 GMT although some exceptions apply and, unlike the spring, schools remain open. 
""It's a catastrophe. We don't have a choice so we do it,"" Yoan Lomet, owner of the restaurant l'Elephant dans la Canette, told Reuters.
In the streets of Geneva, many were dining in the sunshine and even swimming in the lake. Crowds gathered on shopping streets to make last-minute purchases and not all wore masks. 
""I think the (new) measures are not sufficiently drastic,"" said Thierry Barnier, a French resident who works in Geneva, observing people in Geneva's busy Place du Molard.
Geneva University Hospital's director Bertrand Levrat described the situation at the hospital as ""dramatic"" and said it expected to soon begin a helicopter transfer service for COVID patients.
""Now is the time, and some would even say it's a bit late, to take measures,"" Mauro Poggia, Geneva state councillor, told Swiss television on Sunday night. 

Geneva hosts a United Nations office as well as the World Trade Organization (WTO) which is due to hold a key meeting on its new head next week. At least 34 COVID cases have been reported among U.N. staff since mid-October.

The Oct. 22 ruling bans terminations due to foetal defects, ending one of the few legal grounds left for abortion in staunchly Catholic Poland and setting the country further apart from Europe's mainstream.
Protesters have flooded into the streets almost every day since the ruling, defying coronavirus restrictions that ban gatherings of more than five people, in an outpouring of anger against the verdict, and more broadly against the nationalist government and its allies in the Roman Catholic Church.
Footage from private broadcaster TVN24 showed protesters blocking traffic in several streets in central Warsaw. Traffic was also blocked in the southern city of Katowice and in Poznan in western Poland.
In Poznan, the protesters stood in a line blocking tram tracks and a road, chanting ""I will protect my sisters when the state does not protect them"" and holding banners that read ""This is war"" and 'Poland is a woman"".
In Katowice cars blocked traffic in the city centre, while in the south-western city of Wroclaw protesters marched with banners that read ""I think, I feel, I decide"".
The government is expected to publish the ruling later on Monday in its official gazette, meaning it has entered into legal force.
The protests are the latest and largest manifestation of a conflict between liberals and religious conservatives that has also centred around LGBT rights. The protests have seen huge mobilisation among younger Poles.

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), urged the protesters on Monday to take part in talks and not to try and settle differences on the street because of the risks of spreading COVID-19.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The sale of four sophisticated U.S.-made aerial drones to Taiwan has crossed a key hurdle in Congress and is at the last stage of approval, sources said on Monday, a deal likely to add to already strained ties with China.
The $600 million deal would be the first such sale since U.S. policy on the export of sophisticated and closely guarded drone technology was loosened by the Trump administration.
Reuters reported in recent weeks on the administration moving ahead with four other sales of sophisticated military equipment to Taiwan, with a total value of around $5 billion, as it ramps up pressure on China and concerns rise about Beijing's intentions toward the island.
The U.S. State Department could formally notify Congress of the sale later this week, one of the people said. The formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales, but this is unlikely given broad bipartisan support for the defense of Taiwan.
The four MQ-9 SeaGuardian drones, made by General Atomics, would come with associated ground stations and training. While the drones are armable, they will be outfitted with surveillance equipment, the people said.
Reuters reported in September that sales of major weapons systems to Taiwan were making their way through the U.S. export process.
On Oct. 21, the State Department sent notifications to Congress for the first tranche of arms sales to Taiwan. They included truck-based rocket launchers made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), Rocket System (HIMARS) Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) missiles and related equipment made by  Boeing Co  (N:BA), and external sensor pods for F-16 jets.
On Oct. 26 the United States moved ahead with the proposed sale of 100 cruise missile stations and 400 land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing Co (N:BA).

Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province that it has vowed to bring under control, by force if necessary. Washington considers it an important democratic outpost and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed a Texas inmate to pursue his claim against prison officials that his civil rights were violated by being locked up in cells with extremely filthy conditions. 
The justices, in an unsigned opinion, set aside a lower court ruling that had found that prison officials were protected under a legal defense called qualified immunity from the claim in inmate Trent Taylor's lawsuit accusing them of violating the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the decision. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court last week, did not participate in the case. 
Taylor, who is serving an 11-year sentence for aggravated robbery, said he was left naked for six days in two different cells - one covered in human feces and the other covered in raw sewage - at a state psychiatric prison unit in Lubbock in 2013 following a suicide attempt. 
The Supreme Court created qualified immunity five decades years ago to protect government officials from frivolous lawsuits. Police and other officials have said the doctrine ensures that they can make split-second decisions in dangerous situations without the hindrance of worrying about being sued later. 
Taylor, 33, appealed a 2019 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that said that although prison officials violated the Eighth Amendment, they were protected by qualified immunity because their actions were not ""clearly established"" as unlawful at the time. 
The justices disagreed, calling the prison conditions ""deplorably unsanitary.""
""Confronted with the particularly egregious facts of this case, any reasonable officer should have realized that Taylor's conditions of confinement offended the Constitution,"" the justices wrote.
The claims in Taylor's lawsuit arose from a six-day period in September 2013 during his detention at the John T. Montford unit of the Texas Department of Corrections. 
Taylor said that the floor, ceiling, window and water faucet in the first cell, where he was held for about four days, were covered in feces. Taylor said he spent around two days in a separate cell with a drain in the floor where he was told to urinate. The drain was blocked, Taylor said, meaning there was raw sewage on the floor.
Reuters in May published an investigation that revealed how qualified immunity, with the Supreme Court's continual refinements, has made it easier for police officers to kill or injure civilians with impunity. [See https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-police-immunity]
The investigation found that police often escape liability even when a lower court determines they used excessive force in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment, so long as their specific conduct has not been ""clearly established"" in earlier cases as unconstitutional.

In an analysis of hundreds of appeals in excessive force cases between 2005 and 2019, Reuters found an increasing tendency in the courts to grant qualified immunity.

Rescue efforts were continuing in eight buildings in Izmir where 79 people were killed, making Friday's earthquake the deadliest in Turkey for nearly a decade. Two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos, authorities said.
Television footage showed the girl, Elif, being pulled from the rubble and carried by rescue workers on a stretcher to an ambulance, 65 hours after the earthquake struck. 
Elif's two sisters and brother were rescued along with their mother on Saturday, but one of the children subsequently died. 
""A thousand thanks to you, my God. We have brought out our little one Elif from the apartment block,"" Mehmet Gulluoglu, head of Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), wrote on Twitter.
More than 3,500 tents and 13,000 beds have been supplied to provide temporary shelter, according to AFAD, which said 962 people had been injured in Friday's earthquake.
More than 740 victims have so far been discharged from hospitals, AFAD said.
It was the deadliest earthquake in Turkey since one in the eastern city of Van in 2011 which killed more than 500 people. A quake in January this year killed 41 people in the eastern province of Elazig.
Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey.

The Friday earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centred in the Aegean Sea, northeast of Samos.

Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years, was not on the EU's original list of 40 individuals targeted for travel bans and asset freezes, but the EU says his refusal to consider new elections as a way out of the crisis left it with no choice.
EU ambassadors will be given a second sanctions list of 15 officials, including Lukashenko, at a meeting on Wednesday and - barring objections by any member states by close of business on Friday - the plan will be adopted.
The sanctions aim to support mass anti-government protests in Minsk, where thousands of demonstrators have been arrested.
Belarus announced retaliatory measures against the EU last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sided with Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson (NYSE:MCK) in his ongoing effort to avoid a lawsuit filed by a police officer injured during a 2016 protest in Louisiana triggered by the police killing of a Black man.
The justices threw out a lower court ruling that had allowed the lawsuit to proceed and said that more analysis was needed on whether Louisiana state law allows for such a claim.
McKesson has argued that the rights of freedom of speech and assembly under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment should shield him from the lawsuit that accused him of negligence for leading the protest in Baton Rouge, but the court did not resolve that issue.
""The constitutional issue, though undeniably important, is implicated only if Louisiana law permits recovery under these circumstances in the first place,"" the court said in the unsigned ruling.
The officer sustained serious injuries after being struck in the face by a rock or piece of concrete thrown by an unknown person, not by McKesson. 
Litigation will now continue in lower courts.
Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas dissented and newly appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate, the ruling said.
The officer, whose identify was not disclosed in the lawsuit, sued the Black Lives Matter organization and McKesson seeking monetary damages over an incident at a July 2016 protest in Baton Rouge. The negligence lawsuit argued that McKesson should have known that violence would result from his actions leading the protest, which was one of many around the country that year arising from incidents involving police and Black individuals. 
The protest took place outside the police department in the aftermath of the police killing of Alton Sterling, a Black man, after a struggle outside a convenience store where he was selling homemade CDs. The incident was caught on video.
McKesson, a civil rights activist who was one of the leading voices in the Black Lives Matter movement, said that his First Amendment rights outweigh any potential liability for negligence he could face under Louisiana law.
His lawyers said that if protest organizers can be sued for actions taken by others without their involvement, it could enable opponents to effectively block future demonstrations because activists would have to direct resources to battling litigation and could face monetary damages at trial.
McKesson's lawyers, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have cited a 1982 Supreme Court ruling involving Black civil rights activists in Mississippi that limited liability for protest leaders over the conduct of others when they are involved in actions protected by the First Amendment.
The officer, according to the lawsuit, suffered loss of teeth, a jaw injury, a brain injury and a head injury. 
The Black Lives Matter movement was formed after the high-profile killing of a Black 17-year-old named Trayvon Martin by a man named George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012. Its activists have criticized overly aggressive policing particularly against Black Americans. The movement attained further prominence following the May police killing of a Black man named George Floyd in Minneapolis.
In 2017, a federal judge ruled that neither McKesson nor the Black Lives Matter movement as a whole could be sued over the Baton Rouge incident.

The officer appealed and in 2019 the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the claim against McKesson, who then appealed to the Supreme Court. The 5th Circuit left in place the judge's ruling dismissing Black Lives Matter from the case.

BERLIN (Reuters) - There will be no big New Year's parties in Germany this year, but families should be able to come together for Christmas, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday, in a message meant to reassure the nation as a month-long lockdown took effect.
The lockdown, which includes the closure of restaurants, gyms and theatres, was necessary to protect Germany's health system, said Merkel, warning that the number of people with the virus in intensive care units had doubled in the last 10 days.
""The light at the end of the tunnel is still quite a long way off,"" she told a news conference. 
But striking a more hopeful tone than when she presented the lockdown measures last Wednesday, the chancellor also said that if Germans reduce their contact with each other in November, they would be able to do more over Christmas.
""It's going to be a Christmas under coronavirus conditions, but it shouldn't be a lonely Christmas,"" she said.
""I don't think there will be big New Year's parties, but that core family members will be able to visit each other, perhaps with protective measures.""
Citing one example, she said families might be permitted to visit grandparents after a few days of ""pre-quarantine"".
Germany kept infection and death rates below those of many of its neighbours in the first phase of the crisis early this year, but like much of the rest of Europe it is now facing a second wave with record infection rates.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 12,097 to 545,027, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's main infectious diseases agency, showed on Monday. The reported death toll rose by 49 to 10,530, the tally showed.
""We can't allow this rapid spread of the virus to overwhelm our health system,"" Merkel said in opening remarks in which she defended the 'lockdown light' against sceptics.

""Throughout the winter months, we will have to limit private contacts,"" she said, before adding: ""I don't want a curfew in Germany if we can avoid it.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - German police are investigating a Syrian satirist who filmed a video in a Berlin street in which, dressed in an Arab robe and turban, he flogged a handcuffed man wearing a mask depicting French President Emmanuel Macron.
The video also showed Fayez Kanfash dragging the Macron character on a leash cheered by onlookers on Sonnenallee, a street in Berlin's Neukoelln district known for its Arab and Turkish restaurants and shops
Kanfash has more than one million followers on Youtube and he uses his channel to promote Islam as a peaceful religion.
Macron has stirred anger across parts of the Muslim world over his defence of the right to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Muslims deem them blasphemous and insulting to the prophet.
Four people have been killed in two attacks in French cities by suspected Islamist militants in recent weeks as the furore over the cartoons has raged.
A Berlin police spokesman said authorities were looking into whether the Macron flogging stunt amounted to incitement to commit violence or whether it was satire. A 23-year-old was questioned about the incident, the spokesman said, without naming the person.
Kanfash, who said he was stopped and questioned by police about the stunt, said he wanted to show Germans and Westerners that freedom of expression has its limits.
""The intention was never to incite violence,"" he said by phone from Berlin, which became his home four years ago after he fled Syria. ""We just wanted to say, 'if freedom of expression allows you to insult our prophet, then don't be offended if we insult your leaders'.""
Germany is home to 3 million Turks and about 800,000 Syrians.

""We have come to bless President Trump, both for the past, to thank him, but also for the future, that he succeeds in the coming election,"" Yishai Fleisher, spokesman for the Hebron settlers, said at the Cave of the Patriarchs burial site.
One of those interred there, according to tradition, is Abraham, who is revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims. Hoping to encourage coexistence between Jews and Palestinians, the Trump administration has named the Israeli-Arab rapprochement that it has been brokering the ""Abraham Accords"".
But Trump, a Republican running against Democratic former vice president Joe Biden in Tuesday's election, has been shunned by Palestinians for perceived bias since he broke with global consensus by recognising Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. 
His administration has also softened U.S. disapproval of Israel's settlements on land where the Palestinians want to establish a state, and which most world powers deem illegal.
A rabbi officiating at Monday's ceremony prayed for God to secure Trump ""four more years"", citing the president's ""commitment to the preservation and strengthening of the people of Israel, the state of Israel and the land of Israel"". 

A Trump peace plan stirred some settler anger, however, by proposing that Palestinians get a state on 70% of the West Bank.

The British government summoned the Iranian ambassador last week after the news that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was to be recalled to court in Iran.
""It is appalling that Iran has begun a new case against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and have threatened her with being returned to prison. The Iranian authorities have put an intolerable burden on Nazanin and her family,"" British foreign minister Dominic Raab said in a statement.
""I am relieved she remains on temporary release, but she needs to be returned home to her family. We continue to make this clear in the strongest terms.""
A project manager with the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation, the dual national was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she prepared to head back to Britain with her daughter after a family visit.
She was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran's clerical establishment. Her family and the foundation, a charity that operates independently of media firm Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters, deny the charge.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe was temporarily released from jail in March in response to concerns about the spread of COVID-19 in Iran's prisons, but her movements are restricted and she is barred from leaving the country.
Lawmaker Tulip Siddiq said she had spoken to Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, who said she had been taken to court, and that the trial was adjourned before she could put forward a defence.

""No date for next hearing, but also no prison & she is back home with her parents,"" Siddiq said in a tweet.

OIAPOQUE, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil has mobilized more than 4,000 soldiers to patrol its northern coast near the jungle border with French Guiana for the trafficking of drugs, weapons and gold and for other crimes, which are rampant in the remote Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest region.
Reuters accompanied soldiers armed with rifles as they navigated Amazon rivers and coastlines in boats and amphibious tanks over two days of patrols in the northern Amazon rainforest states of Pará and Amapá.
Police, environmental authorities and other government agencies are also involved in the mission, called Operation Ágata Norte.
The mission, which began on Oct. 22 and is set to continue into November, has seized 146,000 tonnes of manganese, 86 grams of gold and several shipments of undocumented lumber, and destroyed 3,000 marijuana plants, according to a Defense Ministry statement.
""The biggest problem that we've seen, which could become an even bigger problem in the future, is the issue of illegal wildcat mines, mainly the deforestation and environmental damage that they bring,"" said General Adilson Giovani Quint, commander of one of the jungle infantry brigades on the mission.
Destruction of Brazil's Amazon rainforest at the hands of illegal miners, loggers and other criminals has surged since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in Jan. 2019.

Bolsonaro has called for commercial farming and mining in the Amazon, saying it will help lift the region out of poverty. He has also weakened environmental enforcement agencies that he sees as too zealous in issuing fines and destroying illegal mining and logging equipment.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Qatar are among countries slated to establish relations with Israel under a regional rapprochement launched by U.S. President Donald Trump, an Israeli official said on Monday.
Straying from Israel's reticence about Tuesday's U.S. election, Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen said implementing further normalisation deals could depend on the next president displaying continued ""resolve"" against Iran.
Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden wants to rejoin the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal that the Republican incumbent quit, to the satisfaction of Israel and some Gulf Arabs.
Trump, who has played up his Middle East policy while campaigning, was asked last week which countries might follow the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan in normalising ties with Israel. ""We have five definites,"" he responded.
Cohen said Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Morocco and Niger were ""on the agenda"". 
""These are the five countries,"" he told Ynet TV. ""And if the Trump policy continues, we will be able to reach additional agreements."" 
While not explicitly favouring either U.S. candidate, Cohen argued that Trump's policy had prompted Arab and Muslim countries to seek accommodation with Israel. 
If the next president ""does show resolve vis-a-vis Iran, then what will happen is that they will take their time, will not rush, will not choose a side,"" Cohen said. ""A concessionary policy will gets the peace deals stuck.""
Saudi Arabia, the Gulf powerhouse and Islam's birthplace, quietly acquiesced to the UAE and Bahrain deals with Israel, signed on Sept. 15. But Riyadh has stopped short of endorsing them, and signalled it is not ready to follow suit.
The Saudis were the architects of a 2002 Israeli-Arab peace proposal that called for Israeli withdrawal from occupied land to make way for a Palestinian state. 

Qatar, which has links to Iran and Hamas, has ruled out normalisation before Palestinians achieve statehood.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican says comments by Pope Francis on civil union laws in a documentary last month were taken out of context and did not signal a change in Church doctrine on homosexuals or support for same-sex marriage.
The documentary, ""Francesco"", which premiered at the Rome film festival on Oct. 21, made headlines for a comment in which the pope says that homosexuals have a right to be in a family and that civil union laws covering homosexuals are needed.
The pope's comments as portrayed prompted praise from liberals and calls for urgent clarification from conservatives.
Last week, the Vatican's Secretariat of State quietly sent an ""explanatory note"" to its ambassadors, who sent it to bishops.
The note was first reported by papal biographer Austen Ivereigh. A Vatican source confirmed it on Monday and the Vatican's ambassador to Mexico posted it on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
It says that two separate quotes in response to separate questions were spliced to appear as one, deleting the intervening context and questions.
The documentary's director, Russian-born American citizen Evgeny Afineevsky, told reporters he interviewed the pope but journalists later found the footage in a 2019 interview with Mexico's Televisa. Some was not previously aired.
After the documentary premiered, Afineevsky refused to discuss the editing process. It was not immediately possible to contact him for comment on the Vatican note.
The note said that in the first quote, the pope was referring to the right of homosexuals to be accepted by their own families as children and siblings. 
Some saw the comments as homosexuals having a right to form families.
The note said the documentary cut comments where the pope expressed opposition to opposed homosexual marriage and made clear he was referring to civil union laws, which some countries have enacted to regulate benefits such as health care.
A phrase where Francis said ""it is an incongruence to speak of homosexual marriage"" was cut.
""It is clear that Pope Francis was referring to certain state provisions and certainly not the doctrine of the Church, which he has reaffirmed numerous times over the years,"" the note said.

The Church teaches that homosexual tendencies are not sinful but homosexual acts are and that homosexuals must be treated with respect.

Fewer than one in four registered voters cast a ballot, Algeria's lowest ever turnout, with many in the opposition ""Hirak"" street protest movement opposing the referendum. 
Two thirds of those who did vote supported the changes, the electoral commission head Mohamed Charfi said at a news conference on Monday, adding that the coronavirus had negatively affected turnout. 
However, it means that only 15.8% of registered voters went to the polls and cast a ballot in favour of the new constitution. Prominent members of Hirak hailed the low turnout as a defeat for the government's strategy. 
""I hope men and women within the system will understand this lesson and do what is needed to listen to the people's demands. The people want their own constitution and institutions,"" said Mustapha Bouchachi, a lawyer and human rights activist. 
The changes approved in the referendum include presidential term limits, new powers for the parliament and judiciary and a clause to let the army intervene outside Algeria's borders. 
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who is in hospital in Germany, pushed the process of constitutional reform to try to quell mass street protests that thrust Algeria last year into its biggest crisis for decades. 
The protests forced Tebboune's predecessor Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down after 20 years in office, and continued even after December's election, stopping only when Algeria imposed a lockdown against the pandemic. 
Tebboune had hailed the protests as a moment of national renewal, offering dialogue with demonstrators and embarking on a process of consultations to change the constitution. 
Meanwhile, the authorities tried and imprisoned close Bouteflika allies and prominent businessmen in his circle on corruption charges. 

Yet many Hirak members maintain their goals - replacing a governing elite that has ruled since independence from France in 1963, ending corruption and forcing the army to withdraw from politics - were only partly accomplished.

""I will pay homage to senior monks, and then I will go with police, I will go wherever they send,"" he said, accusing the government and ruling party of bullying him, according to a video broadcast of the speech.
Wirathu is known for his rhetoric against minority Muslims, particularly the Rohingya community, but he has also been critical of the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi and supportive of Myanmar’s powerful military.
The western district court in Yangon issued a warrant for his arrest in May last year.
His surrender to authorities comes days ahead of a Nov. 8 national election.

Wirathu is the most prominent of the nationalist monks to gain growing political weight in Myanmar since a transition from military rule began in 2011.
He has often targeted Rohingya Muslims, more than 730,000 of whom fled an army crackdown in Rakhine State in 2017 that United Nations investigators said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"".

Riot police on Sunday fired warning shots into the air, used stun grenades and arrested more than 300 people to deter tens of thousands of Belarusians who marched through Minsk to demand veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko leave power.
Mass demonstrations have taken place since the Aug. 9 election. Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, rejects accusations the vote was rigged and says he has no intention of quitting.
At a regular review of Belarus at the U.N. Human Rights Council, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland and the United States called for releasing people rounded up in protests and for investigating widespread allegations of torture.
The Aug. 9 elections were fraudulent, said Andrew Bremberg, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva.
""We are deeply concerned by the ongoing use of violence, intimidation and repression against the Belarusian people,"" he said, calling on the authorities to ""demonstrate restraint and engage in a genuine dialogue with Belarusian civil society"".

Resource-rich Papua has been plagued by a long-standing conflict between security forces and separatist groups since its absorption into Indonesia in 1969.
In late September, Christian pastor Yeremia Zanambani was found dead with gunshot wounds in a pig shed, sparking outrage and pressure from church groups for an investigation.
A report on Monday by Indonesia's human rights commission (Komnas HAM) said it suspected a military officer of torturing and shooting the pastor during a search for missing weapons and the whereabouts of separatists.
Describing the killing as ""extra-judicial"", the report said wounds from a sharp weapon were also found on the pastor.
After a separate government fact-finding probe, Indonesia's chief security minister said last month security forces or a ""third party"" may have had some involvement. 
Komnas HAM said in Monday's report it had recommended to President Joko Widodo and the security minister that along with finding the culprits, witnesses should be protected and efforts made to ensure a less security-driven approach to policing the area. 
""Civilians become victims after being suspected of joining separatist groups by the TNI (Indonesian army) or the police,"" Beka Ulung Hapsara, a commissioner at Komnas HAM, told Reuters.
Responding to the report, military spokesman Colonel Gusti Nyoman Suriastawa said an investigation was ongoing and it would not hesitate to punish any officer if found guilty.

Lempart, a 41-year-old lawyer by training and one of the heads of Strajk Kobiet (Women's Strike), thinks the parallels between the Polish and Belarusian movements are clear: they are being run by Eastern Europeans and by women.
With her thick-framed black glasses and blonde hair speckled with gray, she has led daily marches across Poland, giving speeches to the point of losing her voice and encouraging people to go out on the streets despite the coronavirus pandemic. 
""We see that many things work in a similar way in Poland and in Belarus...we are culturally close still. We are in the European Union...but we have this common spirit with many countries to the east of Poland,"" Lempart told Reuters, wearing a black mask bearing the movement's signature red lightning bolt. 
""I think it is a backlash against a patriarchal culture, against patriarchal states against the fundamentalist religious states, against the states that treat women really badly,"" she added.
Unlike Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lempart is no activism novice having been involved in Poland's ""black protests"" for women's rights since 2016. 
But she is looking to Tsikhanouskaya for ideas on how to keep protests going despite a surge in coronavirus cases in Poland.
Strajk Kobiet set up its own ""coordination council"" on Sunday, modelling it on the Belarusian initiative which brought together activists, economists and former politicians to plan out the burgeoning revolution in Belarus.
After the first meeting in Warsaw, Lempart said the group wanted better access to abortion, stronger women's and LGBT rights, the separation of church and state and more support for a struggling healthcare system, small businesses and education. 
Lempart insists the goal of the protests is not to create a political movement, although she is hoping for greater European Union support.
""They should be protecting us, the Polish citizens...They are turning their backs on us and talking just to the Polish government and they should be talking to us,"" Lempart said. 
In the meantime, the goal of the women's strike is to ensure the protests continue, despite a record daily spike in coronavirus cases in Poland on Saturday of nearly 22,000.
A blockade is planned on Monday while a solidarity chain into smaller Polish towns is scheduled for Wednesday. 

""We won't get scared,"" Lempart said. ""People might get tired. This is our job in supporting people in not getting tired.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Thousands of angry Muslims protested outside the French embassy in the Indonesian capital on Monday carrying banners calling French President Emmanuel Macron the ""real terrorist"" and demanding the country’s ambassador be immediately expelled.
Joining global outcry over Macron’s comments about Islam, protesters in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation demanded the French leader withdraw his words and apologise to Muslims around the world.
""Inshallah (God willing), we Muslims forgive but if he does not withdraw all his words and caricatures and apologise, Inshallah, he will always be despised (by the Muslim world),” Nazaruddin, a 70-year-old protestor, told Reuters.
Dressed in black and white prayer caps and face masks, protesters joined Monday’s protest in downtown Jakarta carrying banners with a devilish caricature of the French president’s face, red with pointed ears, carrying the words ""Macron is the real terrorist"". 
Demonstrators waved Islamic flags while calling for the French ambassador to be expelled and a boycott on French products.
In recent weeks the French president has enraged Muslims for describing Islam as a ""religion in crisis all over the world"" and for vehemently defending free speech that some have deemed blasphemous and inflammatory. 
Macron’s remarks came before and after two recent attacks in France. 
Last week a knife-wielding Tunisian man yelling “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greatest) beheaded a woman and killed two other people in the French city of Nice. 
Two weeks earlier a teacher was beheaded by an 18-year-old, who was apparently enraged that a cartoon of Prophet Mohammad had been shown in class. 
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known by his nickname ""Jokowi"", has condemned both the recent attack in Nice, and Macron’s comments, which he said had “insulted Islam” and ""hurt the unity of Muslims everywhere"". 

Indonesia’s foreign ministry has summoned the French ambassador on Tuesday to discuss the remarks.

China urges the United States to stop its ""political crackdown"" on Chinese journalists, ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a news briefing.
""Upholding the principle of answering words with words and actions with actions, China will take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese journalists,"" said Wang.
The United States in March slashed the number of Chinese nationals allowed to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state-owned media, and on May 11 limited their stay to 90 days, with an option to extend. 
China has expelled U.S. journalists working for several U.S. newspapers this year, and introduced new visa restrictions on several U.S. media companies. 
Some Chinese journalists were last week granted visa extensions due to expire as soon as Nov. 4, said Wang. Others have not been granted an extension yet, he said. 
""We once again urge the U.S. to immediately give up its illusions and stop the political persecution and suppression of Chinese reporters,"" said Wang. 
""Do not say that you were not forewarned by China.""

The two countries' relations have deteriorated recently over various issues including trade and the novel coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China.

Cast by his supporters as the godfather of Brexit, Farage said Johnson had terrified the United Kingdom into submission over COVID-19 and squandered vast amounts of taxpayers' money while holding out hopes of a ""miraculous"" vaccine. 
""The single most pressing issue is the government's woeful response to coronavirus,"" Farage and Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice said in a joint article in The Daily Telegraph.
""Ministers have lost touch with a nation divided between the terrified and the furious. The debate over how to respond to COVID is becoming even more toxic than that over Brexit.""
Johnson on Saturday ordered England back into a national lockdown from Thursday morning after the United Kingdom passed the milestone of one million COVID-19 cases and a second wave of infections threatened to overwhelm the health service.
The United Kingdom, which has the biggest official death toll in Europe from COVID-19, is grappling with more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day and scientists have warned the ""worst case"" scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded.
Farage, a former commodities trader, has transformed British politics over the past decade by poaching Conservative voters to force a succession of prime ministers toward ever tougher positions on Europe.
TRUMP ALLY 
Farage, whom U.S. President Donald Trump calls a friend, has spoken alongside the president in the election campaign.
He said lockdowns don't work.
Instead, Farage proposed targeting those most a risk, like the sick and the elderly, but said ordinary people should not be criminalised for trying to live normal lives such as meeting family for Christmas.
""The rest of the population should, with good hygiene measures and a dose of common sense, get on with life. This way we build immunity in the population,"" he said.
The perceived electoral threat to the Conservatives from the United Kingdom Independence Party which Farage formerly led was one of the main reasons then-prime minister David Cameron decided in 2013 to promise the Brexit referendum.
Shunned by the British political establishment, Farage, backed by Eurosceptic financiers, helped sell Brexit to millions of voters in England and Wales who felt ignored by the mainstream Conservative and Labour parties.

The party will be recast as Reform UK -- a nod to his view that the country is in urgent need of fundamental reform.

Snowden's wife, Lindsay (NYSE:LNN), is expecting a child in late December, the RIA news agency cited Anatoly Kucherena, his Russian lawyer, as saying. 
Snowden, 37, fled the United States and was given asylum in Russia after leaking secret files in 2013 that revealed vast domestic and international surveillance operations carried out by the U.S. National Security Agency where he was a contractor.
U.S. authorities have for years wanted Snowden returned to the United States to face a criminal trial on espionage charges brought in 2013.
""After years of separation from our parents, my wife and I have no desire to be separated from our son. That's why, in this era of pandemics and closed borders, we're applying for dual US-Russian citizenship,"" Snowden wrote on Twitter.
""Lindsay and I will remain Americans, raising our son with all the values of the America we love — including the freedom to speak his mind. And I look forward to the day I can return to the States, so the whole family can be reunited.
Our greatest wish is that, wherever our son lives, he feels at home.""
Russia has already granted Snowden permanent residency rights, his lawyer said last month, a vital step towards Russian citizenship.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in August he was considering a pardon for Snowden. Trump is running for a second presidential term against Democratic challenger Joe Biden at elections on Tuesday. 

Snowden keeps a low profile in Russia. He has praised the country's natural beauty and the warmth of its people, while using social media to criticise government policy from time to time.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will make an aerial inspection on Monday of the havoc from the world's strongest typhoon this year, which has killed 16 people, though officials said a forcible evacuation effort had averted more deaths.
Three people have also been reported missing in provinces south of the main island of Luzon, the disaster agency added in a statement, with communications to some regions still severed.
Typhoon Goni, which battered provinces south of the capital Manila on Sunday, is the 18th to hit the Philippines this year and one of the strongest typhoons since Haiyan killed more than 6,300 people in 2013.
""The goal should be zero casualties, but since people were forcibly evacuated our casualties were reduced,"" Harry Roque, a spokesman for Duterte, told a news conference.
Duterte is to fly to Manila from his southern hometown of Davao for an aerial inspection of some of the worst-hit areas, Roque added. He was in Davao when the typhoon struck, provoking some public criticism.
The Philippine police chief was also travelling to Guinobatan in the province of Albay after a lawmaker reported about 300 houses were buried under volcanic rock and mud flows from the Mayon volcano.
Goni, packing gusts of up to 310 kph (190 mph), destroyed up to 80% of homes in several towns in Catanduanes, Senator Richard Gordon, the chief of the Philippine Red Cross, told media.
With its communication and power lines down, the province of 275,000 people was cut off, said Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi.
Goni hit 2.1 million residents of Luzon, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, leaving more than 50,000 homes without power by Monday, while authorities said more than 300,000 people were still in evacuation centres.
Strong winds and torrential rain have damaged crops worth 1.1 billion pesos ($23 million), mainly of rice and corn, Agriculture Secretary William Dar told a news conference.
Before Goni hit land, the Philippines had been grappling with the impact of typhoon Molave, which killed 22 people, most of whom drowned, in provinces south of Manila.
Another storm, Atsani, is gaining strength in the Pacific Ocean as it approaches the Philippines, which is usually lashed by about 20 tropical storms every year.
Vietnam said Goni is forecast to hit its central coast on Wednesday night, dumping more heavy rain in an area where floods and landslides in the past month have already killed about 160 people, with dozens missing.

Those arrested with Mbowe include former member of parliament Godbless Lema, the former mayor of Dar es Salaam, Isaya Mwita, and the former mayor of Ubungo municipality, Boniface Jacob.
""I got a message around midnight that they had been taken in,"" Lissu told Reuters on Monday.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - A late surge from Moldova's diaspora voters gave the pro-Western challenger Maia Sandu the lead in the first round of Sunday's presidential election, setting the stage for a run-off against pro-Moscow incumbent Igor Dodon in the second round. 
Sandu, a Harvard-educated former World Bank economist known for her tough stance on corruption, led with 36.1% while Dodon had 32.66%, according to data from the election commission with 99.81%% of votes counted. 
A candidate needs over 50% of the vote to avoid the Nov. 15 runoff, which would be a repeat of the 2016 election, when Dodon defeated Sandu in the second round.
The election in the nation of 3.5 million, where the West and Russia vie for influence, took place in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic that has pushed one of Europe's poorest countries into a sharp economic downturn. 
""This is an extraordinary mobilization. Thank you,"" Sandu said about diaspora voters. 
Dodon had taken power four years ago after pro-Western political forces became mired in scandals. 
Sandu led a coalition government last year that was brought down within months by a no-confidence vote.
If elected, she has promised to secure more financial support from Brussels, while Dodon has pledged to roll out a settlement next year for the breakaway Russian-speaking region of Transdniestria.
The European Union forged a deal in 2014 on closer trade and political ties with the ex-Soviet republic, which is squeezed between EU member Romania and Ukraine, but became increasingly critical of Chisinau's track record on reforms.
Sandu has received messages of support from German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, and former European Council President Donald Tusk.
A group of Dodon's supporters denounced such support as an attempt to destabilise the country. 
Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR Foreign Intelligence Service, accused the United States last week of plotting to instigate mass protests against Dodon as punishment for him fostering good relations with Moscow. 

Naryshkin similarly accused Washington of fomenting revolution in Belarus, where Moscow-backed President Alexander Lukashenko has battled months of protests following a contested election.

Pictures of the assault first appeared on social media and in domestic news outlets on Sunday and have been shared millions of times.
State media said the violence erupted after the married couple accidentally hit a vehicle while driving an electric scooter in Shuozhou city. Police said in a statement the woman was killed on Saturday morning.
""The suspect is in the custody of public security organs, and the case is being fully investigated,"" police said.
In the footage, cyclists, motorists and pedestrians, including children, can be seen watching the street-side attack.
Media posts about the incident drew tens of thousands of comments, with most criticising the inaction of the bystanders and the lax attitude towards domestic violence in some sectors of Chinese society.
""He's not holding a machine gun, why did no one step forward to control him?"" asked one commenter in a widely shared response. 
China only introduced a specific law criminalising domestic violence in 2015. Activists say violence within families is often ignored.
At the time the law was passed, the government-run All-China Women's Federation estimated that about one in four Chinese women experienced violence during their marriage. Authorities register some 40,000 to 50,000 complaints a year. 
The outrage sparked by the attack is reminiscent of a 2011 incident, also caught on video, when a toddler in the city of Foshan was struck by a vehicle twice and ignored by dozens of passersby.
Social media users pointed out that there is a widely held perception in China that someone who steps in to help could be liable for hospital costs, or ensnared in scams, discouraging people from intervening. 
China in 2017 enacted ""Good Samaritan"" legislation that aiming to tackle the issue by removing civil liability for those involved in helping victims of violence or accidents.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 01:21AM ET</span>",Pandemic protests test Putin's influence in ex-Soviet space,"By Mariya Gordeyeva and Andrew Osborn
BISHKEK (Reuters) - When mobs stormed government buildings and hounded the president from office in the Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan after disputed elections last month, Vladimir Putin seemed unimpressed.
""Every time they have an election, they practically have a coup,"" Putin told the Valdai discussion club, a gathering of Russian experts, by video conference from his residence. ""This is not funny.""
The observation may be valid: Kyrgyzstan, a parliamentary democracy on paper, has experienced three revolutions in the past two decades. But this latest revolution, as the stories of Kyrgyz people like Ulan Kudaiberdiyev reveal, was different.
In March, at the start of a coronavirus lockdown, Kudaiberdiyev lost his job driving taxis in the capital Bishkek. That left his family of eight with zero income for the seven-week period.
By the time the taxi-driver's mother Rakya got sick with COVID-19, state hospitals in the former Soviet republic were full. In a gold-rich country where the official wage is less than $250 a month, the family had to borrow money to pay for someone to come in to give her drugs via intravenous drips.
""We just scraped by,"" Rakya, 75, told Reuters.
Lockdown has been harsh for millions worldwide, and protests are mounting as restrictions multiply. Kyrgyzstan, a state of 6.5 million, is not the only former Soviet republic where they recently caught fire, underlining the fragility of Moscow's grasp in a region it once controlled. 
The Kyrgyz outbreak also shows how quickly economic shock and political frustration in the pandemic can escalate into chaos - and how swiftly Moscow can act to reassert control.
DIFFICULTIES
Putin was already facing a COVID-fuelled political crisis some 4,500 km to the west in Belarus, another ex-Soviet state, where truculent ally and veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko had dismissed the disease, telling people to drink vodka to ward it off.
That attitude angered Belarusian voters, who first mobilised in March to protect themselves from the virus, then challenged his election victory with rolling street protests that have continued.
Putin's grip on the ex-Soviet space has also been shaken by a flare-up in the decades-long conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting - the most violent since bloody ethnic unrest in the 1990s - does not seem linked to the pandemic, but has seen regional rival Turkey trying to muscle into an area Moscow has long regarded as its own domain.
In Kyrgyzstan, voters including Kudaiberdiyev voted for the opposition. When the official count showed no opposition party had won more than 10% of the vote, their frustration boiled over.
Putin, who visited Bishkek last year to agree the expansion of a Russian airbase, called events in Kyrgyzstan a disaster, referencing Russian-financed projects worth half a billion dollars Moscow had recently implemented, and tens of millions of dollars in annual grants.
A week of widely televised chaos, riots and street brawls were brought to a close with the appointment of a new prime minister after the Kremlin put its military airbase on high alert and suspended foreign aid. At least one plane used by Russia's Federal Security Service made a discreet landing in Bishkek. 
For Russia, Kyrgyzstan - which borders China and is one of the stops on Beijing's One Belt, One Road trade corridor across Asia to Europe - is of crucial military and geopolitical importance.
Apart from Russia's main airbase outside the capital, which hosts drones, helicopters and bombers, Moscow runs a naval testing facility at a deep lake in the Tian-Shian mountains.
It also has a naval centre to communicate with nuclear submarines and surface ships, and a seismic monitoring station which it uses to track earthquakes and nuclear weapons tests around the world.
In 2014, under what some analysts saw as pressure from Moscow, Kyrgyzstan shut down a U.S. airbase which had served U.S. operations in Afghanistan since 2001.
Russia boasts strong ties with China, but it is also in competition with Beijing in Kyrgyzstan. Like Putin, President Xi Jinping was also in Bishkek last year, and China has positioned itself as a major creditor to the authorities. 
Both Moscow and Beijing have pledged COVID help to the republic.
PAIN
With no savings, Kudaiberdiyev's family was forced into debt to survive during the lockdown. A bank loan of around $630 helped the family buy food and medicine and, along with handouts from charities and neighbours and a modest food package from the state, kept them going until May.
When the election came around, they backed the Mekenchil (Patriotic) party, which focused on the injustice of pandemic-related economic hardship and promised ordinary people a greater share of income from natural resources - such as gold - extracted by foreign-owned companies.
Many others felt the squeeze. About one quarter of the Kyrgyz population lives on less than US$ 1.3 a day, according to the World Food Programme. More than half of the poorer households surveyed by the country's Economic Policy Research Institute in May and June said their financial situation had deteriorated since lockdown. 
Other voters backed the same party over what they said was appalling official corruption, which they believed had seen foreign aid and money to battle the virus go into the pockets of officials. A month before the vote, financial police said they would investigate allegations of negligence and corruption that had worsened the COVID situation.
Kyrgyzstan's corruption score of 30/100 at watchdog Transparency International last year suggested it was more corrupt than sub-Saharan Africa. 
Fanning the flames, lockdown had brought many young men home. In Kyrgyzstan, as much as one-third of the economy comes from remittances from Russia, according to an August report by the United Nations Development Programme and Asian Development Bank.
The lockdown may have forced as many as 100,000 workers, most of them young men, back to farms or to seek work in urban areas, it said. Even after restrictions eased, the report said some were likely to have stayed behind.
ANGER
When initial election results showed Mekenchil had failed to make inroads at the ballot box, people were furious. 
On Oct. 5, protests broke out. Crowds stormed and ransacked government buildings, forced the incumbent government to step down, freed former political leaders from jail and threw the republic's leadership into limbo.
Four days into rival rallies to promote different candidates, one standoff proved pivotal. 
Several thousand supporters of Sadyr Japarov, a politician and convicted kidnapper who was among those sprung from jail, held a noisy rally as supporters of two rival candidates for the premiership were demonstrating nearby. 
At one point, some of Japarov's followers charged at the other groups, throwing stones and bottles, forcing them to withdraw from Bishkek's central square. Shots were fired. 
""It is clear that one of the obstacles towards democratic progress is the attempt by organised crime groups to exert influence over politics and elections,"" the U.S. embassy in Kyrgyzstan said in a statement, condemning what it called ""violence and intimidation"" on the square.
On Oct. 12, Putin's deputy chief of staff flew into Bishkek to meet the country's beleaguered president, Sooronbay Jeenbekov, and his challenger Japarov.
Around this time the head of Russia's FSB held talks with new Kyrgyz security officials; flight-tracking data seen by Reuters showed the arrival of at least one plane used by the FSB. 
After nearly a week of violent turmoil, parliament chose Japarov as prime minister in a repeat vote on Oct 14. A day later, the president resigned, and Japarov assumed his powers too.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov assured the new government Moscow was ready to assist ""legitimate authorities"" stabilise the situation. 
Japarov was quick to pledge loyalty to Russia.

""Russia has been our strategic partner for a long time,"" he said. ""And that is something that will continue to be the case.""

YANGON (Reuters) - As Myanmar prepares for a general election next week, an opposition politician has found a new way of connecting with voters facing novel coronavirus restrictions and getting her message out.
Han Oo Khin, a candidate for the People's Pioneer Party (PPP), has been criss-crossing her constituency in the commercial capital of Yangon for more than a month with a truck selling affordable groceries ranging from eggs to onions and noodles.
The Thingangyun township is one of the areas worst affected by the coronavirus so 34-year-old Han Oo Khin, who is an advertising entrepreneur, believes her mobile market stall will help people get their shopping and help her win some votes.
""It's like killing two birds with one stone,"" said Han, speaking beside the truck, which carries a big poster of her on the back, as her supporters handed out leaflets along with groceries to a cluster of shoppers.
""It assists the grassroots people in my township and on the other hand, it introduces my party and me to the public.""
Han reckons the truck has helped her make contact with thousands of people in her constituency, where there are 180,000 voters due to cast ballots on Sunday, when Myanmar holds its second general election since the end of strict military rule.
With more than 50,000 coronavirus cases and more than 1,200 deaths, Myanmar is facing one of Southeast Asia's worst outbreaks of the virus and election campaigning across the country has been hit by curbs on movements and gatherings. 
The PPP is one of several new political parties emerging to challenge the popularity of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Suu Kyi's party is widely expected to win but smaller parties say they see opportunities with her support chipped away by growing ethnic conflict in some areas and a sluggish economy.
The PPP is headed by a former member of parliament from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy who was expelled from the party for criticising it over various issues.
Han has no illusions the PPP can defeat the ruling party but she's looking long term and plans to keep operating the grocery truck to help build her party's image and her profile.

""We'll keep serving the people to prepare for the 2025 election,"" she said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has accepted just 164 asylum seekers this year from nearly 6,000 who applied despite coronavirus travel curbs, government data showed. 
Immigration is a contentious issue in South Korea, where many pride themselves on ethnic homogeneity, even as its population of 51 million rapidly ages and the labour force shrivels.
The figure of 5,896 applicants for refugee status between January and August was down about 36% from the corresponding period last year, data from the justice ministry showed last week. 
Russians topped the list of applicants at nearly 18%, followed by people from Egypt, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and India.
Only about 4% of the 4,019 who completed the screening process were accepted or granted residency for humanitarian reasons, although not recognised as refugees, a rate less than the 6% of 2019 and 16% of 2018, the data showed. 
South Korea began accepting refugee applications in 1994 in line with a U.N. refugee convention. The number of asylum seekers has risen sharply since it became the first Asian nation to adopt its own refugee law in 2013, peaking at 16,173 in 2018. 
But the government clamped down after a sudden spike in Yemeni arrivals in the southern resort island of Jeju that year stoked fears over a possible rise in crime and other social ills.
Defectors from neighbouring North Korea are not regarded as asylum seekers and automatically receive citizenship. 
In Europe, although asylum applications have also plummeted this year amid border closures against the virus, many countries have sheltered hundreds of thousands of refugees stricken by war and poverty.
But few Asian nations, including Japan, have been keen to accept more refugees.

Robertson, who will continue as finance minister, will replace Winston Peters of Labour's previous coalition partner New Zealand First, while Ardern said Davis wanted to focus on making a difference for the country's Maori people.
A thumping election win gave Ardern the freedom to form the first single-party government since New Zealand adopted a German-style proportional voting system in 1996. 
Her new ministry, however, will still include two senior Green Party members, in roles outside of cabinet, with coalitions the norm in the Pacific nation of five million as parties look to build consensus.
Ardern said her government's top priorities will be to drive economic recovery from COVID-19 while continuing to shield the country from the virus, which has largely been kept at bay.
""The next three years will be very challenging for New Zealand. With the global outlook worsening we won't be immune to the ongoing impact COVID is having around the world,"" Ardern told reporters in Wellington.
Ardern's popularity, boosted by her leadership in tackling the coronavirus, helped Labour win 64 of the 120 seats in the country's unicameral parliament - the party's biggest election victory in half a century.

New Zealand has so far reported 25 deaths and just over 1,600 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, far lower than many other developed countries.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Hundreds of demobilized former members of the FARC rebel group marched in Colombia's capital Bogota on Sunday to demand more security, implementation of a 2016 peace deal, and an end to the killings of former combatants.
Waving both white and Colombian flags, former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) arrived in Bogota as part of the 'pilgrimage for life and peace.'
The killings of 236 former members of the demobilized FARC since the signing of the 2016 peace deal has been a major hurdle for implementation of the agreement that ended the group's role in more than five decades of conflict which has left 260,000 dead and millions displaced. 
The United Nations has expressed concern over killings of former FARC in the wake of the peace deal, which allowed some 13,000 members of the leftist rebel group to demobilize. 
""We laid down our arms believing in the promises of the state, yet to date 236 of our comrades have been killed in different parts of the country,"" said senator Carlos Antonio Lozada of the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, the political party born out of the peace deal which kept the rebel group's FARC acronym.
Lozada demanded full guarantees for the social and economic reintegration of demobilized rebels, adding that the state is obliged to protect their lives. 
The government of President Ivan Duque says it is committed to the peace deal, blaming FARC dissidents who rejected the 2016 agreement, as well as other illegal armed groups involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining, of killing former FARC guerrilla members. 

Pastor Alape, a former top FARC rebel commander and peace negotiator, blamed ""powers that benefit from war and violence"" for the killings of ex-combatants. He called on the government for greater social investment and a lower military presence in areas affected by violence.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Riot police fired warning shots into the air, used stun grenades and arrested more than 200 people to deter tens of thousands of Belarusians who marched through Minsk on Sunday to demand veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko leave power.
Mass demonstrations have flooded the capital for 12 straight weeks since a disputed election, ratcheting up pressure on the embattled leader of 26 years who rejects accusations the vote was rigged and says he has no intention of quitting. 
This week Lukashenko partially closed the border to the west, replaced his interior minister and said that any protester who lays a hand on officers policing the protests should ""at least leave without hands"".
Tens of thousands of people swept through Minsk in at least two columns, the Nasha Niva newspaper reported.
The Vesna-96 rights group published the names of 221 people who had been detained. 
Senior police officials have threatened to use firearms against protesters if needed.
""The situation is really alarming and everyone's mood is tense,"" one protester who requested anonymity said by phone. 
""Police buses and equipment are constantly driving past the column. It feels like people are ready for any kind of escalation."" 
A witness told Reuters that riot police used force to disperse marchers who had marched towards Kurapaty, a site on the outskirts of Minsk that is a memorial to victims of execution by Soviet secret police. 
""People got to a field near Kurapaty, (police) buses pulled up and chased after people at top speed, then they started throwing grenades. What's more, they were throwing them into the thick of the crowd,"" the witness said by phone on condition of anonymity.
A man in civilian clothing chased a resident through a courtyard near one protest route firing a paintball gun at them in footage published by the RFE/RL media outlet. 
Video posted on opposition social media showed a crowd of people chanting ""We believe, we can, we will win!"" while marching through the streets. The video footage could not independently be verified. 

Mobile phone internet in the capital was unavailable and several metro stations were briefly closed down.

NICE, France (Reuters) - Shocked local parishioners gathered outside the Notre-Dame catholic church in the southern French city of Nice on Sunday, seeking solace at its first mass in the three days since a knifewielding attacker killed three people inside.
In France's second deadly knife attack in two weeks with a suspected Islamist motive, an assailant shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest) beheaded a woman and killed two other people in the basilica.
Church sexton Vincent Loques was one of the victims, along with devout mother-of-three- Simone Barreto Silva, who moved to France from Brazil as a teenager. A 60-year-old woman, named by church officials as Nadine, was beheaded.
On Sunday evening, several hundred people gathered on the other side of a security perimetre around the church to follow the mass from a distance. 
""I was baptised here, took holy communion here... my parents were buried here. It was very important to come out of solidarity,"" church regular Michele, 67, said before the mass got underway. ""It was a shock... It was a barbaric act.""
The Nice attack followed the beheading of a Paris schoolteacher on Oct. 16 by a Chechen-born man, apparently angered that the teacher had shown cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad to teach a lesson on free speech.
Standing on the steps of the church, which was covered in wreaths and candles, the bishop of Nice, Andre Marceau, paid tribute to the three victims. 
""The meaning of this celebration is to speak of... our bewilderment, our sadness, our suffering, our feeling of anger maybe, our struggle to understand,"" Marceau said ahead of the mass. ""And above all, to give strength to our peacemakers.""
The church is located not far from the seaside promenade, where a suspected Islamist drove a 19-tonne truck into a crowd in 2016, killing more than 80 people on Bastille Day.
The people of Nice had suffered enough, said Martine Leroy, a local resident outside the church. 

""We form a bloc today, and people need to see this bloc, the whole world needs to see it,"" she said. ""It all has to stop. We're here to tell our leaders that we've had enough, we want to be able to be at ease walking around in our city.""

After resisting calls for a new national lockdown for most of last month, Johnson announced on Saturday that restrictions across England will begin after midnight on Thursday and last until Dec. 2.
The United Kingdom, which has the highest official COVID-19 death toll in Europe, is grappling with more than 20,000 new cases a day. Scientists have warned a worst-case scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded this winter.
""Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now, we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave,"" Johnson is expected to say, according to his office.
""Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level.""
Britain has reported 46,717 COVID-19 deaths - defined as those dying within 28 days of a positive test. A broader measure of those with COVID-19 on their death certificates puts the toll at 58,925.
Essential shops, schools, and universities in England will remain open but pubs and restaurants will be shut apart from for takeaways. Outbound international travel will be discouraged except for work and non-essential retail will close.
Lawmakers will vote on these measures on Wednesday and the opposition Labour Party has offered its support.
The rest of the United Kingdom - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have their own lockdown policies and enacted tougher health restrictions last month.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove on Sunday said England's lockdown could be extended beyond Dec. 2 if necessary, but Johnson will tell lawmakers that an extension is not the plan.

But officials also ruled out making exceptions for booksellers or other small stores upset about the lockdown, hitting back at sporadic resistance to the restrictions on non-essential shops as some tried to remain open.
""We are taking these measures to protect the French people,"" Prime Minister Jean Castex said in an interview with TV channel TF1. 
Instead, the government will now stop supermarkets from selling non-essential goods like flowers to level the playing field for florists, toy shops and independent booksellers that have to close, Castex said. 
In common with other European nations suffering from an upsurge in the novel coronavirus, France has entered a second strict lockdown, which includes closing non-essential stores for at least 15 days.
Hospitalisations for COVID-19 infections have been creeping up and the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 46,290 in France in the past 24 hours, data on Sunday showed.
The battle between large and small retailers showed the challenge of enforcing the lockdown a second time, particularly in the run-up to the Christmas period where many normally do more business.
Mayors in about 50 cities and towns brought in local edicts over the weekend allowing shops to remain open, with even Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo saying she would to do the same for book stores.
Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday such actions were irresponsible and posed a health risk, but promised some 100 million euros ($116.47 million) to help small businesses build up online operations.
""It shouldn't be that Amazon, let us say, emerges as the big winner of this crisis at the expense of local shops,"" Le Maire told BFM TV.
Amazon said on Saturday it was withdrawing advertising for pre-Black Friday discounts in France after the government said it was inappropriate when other retailers were suffering.
Some small businesses, including many booksellers in France, are experimenting with new ways to stay open. 
One high-profile victim of COVID-19 is the famous English-language Parisian bookshop Shakespeare and Co, which has pleaded with customers to place online orders and collect books from its door.
French writers, literary figures and publisher have launched online petitions asking the government to allow bookstores to remain open. 
The organisers of the prestigious Prix Goncourt literary award said last week they would not announce a winner for this year, as planned on Nov. 10, if bookstores were ordered to shut.

CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (Reuters) - For Ben Yehuda Martinez, head of forensic services in the violence-torn Mexican state of Guerrero, there is more to celebrating Day of the Dead than arranging a colorful altar with flowers and photos.
It means trying to identify 428 bodies currently unclaimed at the state's forensic cemetery, most of them victims of crime.
""Trying to find out their identities ... that's the greatest recognition we can get on the Day of the Dead,"" Martinez said at one of Mexico's newest facilities for unidentified bodies.
The latest official count of people listed as disappeared reached 73,000 this year. Most are believed to be victims of drug cartel turf wars, casting a shadow over the typically festive Nov. 1-2 Day of the Dead holiday.
For families who spend months or years searching for vanished relatives, the possibility of death is often hard to accept, said Arturo Gerardo Cervantes, a forensic adviser for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). 
""They never lose hope of finding their loved ones alive,"" he said.
Still, once there is proof, it can bring closure.
For one family looking for a missing young woman, that proof came from her feet. Relatives fondly recalled how she would put up her feet on the coffee table while watching television.
About 60%-70% of the dead examined by Guerrero's forensic team are shooting victims. Others died in incidents ranging from natural disasters to car crashes. Workers are at pains to treat them with dignity.
On Friday, a priest led a ceremony to commemorate their lives alongside a wreath of golden marigolds, the traditional Day of the Dead flower, before sprinkling holy water upon numbered compartments stacked four rows high.
The scene was a contrast to those playing out at ordinary cemeteries around Mexico, where families pay tribute to deceased relatives with festive picnics and elaborate decorations. 
The cemetery opened in 2017 to relieve overcrowding at forensic facilities caused by record levels of violence.
With ICRC assistance, officials designed the site to accommodate bodies individually, rather than putting several into one grave. The facility holds up to 1,120 in individual tombs.
Each has a plaque with a person's case number, so families can easily retrieve bodies once they are identified.
That requires specialists in matching distinguishing features such as teeth, fingerprints, birthmarks and DNA. Such people are in short supply.

""Here the violence truly, like everywhere else, hasn't slowed down ... bodies arrive every day,"" Martinez said. ""This is a never-ending story.""

QUEBEC CITY, Canada (Reuters) - Two people were killed and five wounded after being stabbed by a man dressed in medieval clothes and wielding a sword, Quebec police said on Sunday, noting the attack appeared to be driven by personal motives and not linked to any terror group.
Police arrested a 24-year-old man from Montreal early on Sunday morning, Quebec Police Chief Robert Pigeon said at a news conference. 
""Dressed in medieval costume and armed with a Japanese sword, everything leads us to believe he chose his victims at random,"" Pigeon said, adding that preliminary information indicated the man was not affiliated with any terror group.
Pigeon said the suspect had come prepared to inflict as much damage as possible but did not elaborate. Quebec newspaper Le Soleil said the suspect had gasoline containers in his car. Pigeon declined to comment on the report. 
The incident began late Saturday night, on Halloween, inside the city's famed walled center. Police told nearby residents to stay indoors and made an arrest after a three-hour manhunt.
""It is once again, and we believe, an isolated act,"" Quebec City Mayor Regis (NYSE:RGS) Labeaume told reporters. ""We need to have a societal debate on the subject (of mental health) because it is becoming more and more difficult to manage.""
In 2017, a Canadian man gunned down six members of a Quebec City mosque and was later sentenced to life in prison.

Quebec's police chief said on Sunday that the suspect had spoken of conducting an attack ""in a medical context"" five years ago but was not known to police and did not have a criminal record.

BOGOTA/BUCARAMANGA, Colombia (Reuters) - Dodging army border patrols, fording rivers and braving low Andean temperatures, thousands of Venezuelan migrants are making arduous journeys into Colombia in search of a better life, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Colombia, which slammed its border shut in March to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, has long been the top destination for migrants fleeing economic and social collapse in neighboring Venezuela. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, Venezuelan migrants flocked homeward, unable to find work when Colombia entered a strict lockdown. Colombian officials estimate more than 100,000 migrants returned home. 
But, with little prospect of an improvement in Venezuela's economic situation, the majority of those are eventually expected to try to return to Colombia, many with relatives or friends, said the head of Colombia's migration agency, Juan Francisco Espinosa.
Hundreds are already crossing illegally each day on foot along the porous 2,219 kilometer (1,380-mile) border, avoiding patrols by the army, police and migration officials.
""We've been walking for 12 days: experiencing cold, sleeplessness, hunger, counting each day and trusting in God,"" said 42-year-old Jose Saenz. He and his eldest son, 22, hope to reach Pereira, in the coffee-growing region of western Colombia, where he used to work in construction.
The father-of-five returned to Venezuela last year for the holidays and then was unable to return when the pandemic struck. He spoke to Reuters on the side of a highway headed to the city of Bucaramanga, still weeks of walking away from his destination.
A majority of the estimated 1.7 million Venezuelans who live in Colombia are undocumented and make their living informally in construction, street-selling or deliveries.
The government is expected to extend the border closure. 
When the border re-opens, some 200,000 migrants are forecast to cross to Colombia within three to five months, taking the total migrant population to about 2 million, Espinosa said.
Colombia's public health and education services are available to migrants regardless of their immigration status. The country has received relatively little support from the international community and repeatedly asked for more aid.
Controlling the border is close to impossible. There are some 53 illegal border crossings in Norte de Santander (MC:SAN) province alone, said General Marco Evangelista Pinto, commander of the army's second division.
""Generally, they come with children, pregnant women, elderly adults and we just tell them they can't pass here. And what they do is find other places,"" he said.
About 300 Venezuelans arrive in Colombia each day via illegal crossings, migration authorities and the army estimate, risking contact with armed groups and having to ford swollen rivers during rainy season.
""This is the second time I've come to Colombia,"" said Yesenia Marquez, 39, walking along a highway connecting the cities of Pamplona and Bucaramanga with her two children. 
""I had to return to Venezuela because of family problems and when I decided to come back, COVID blocked my way.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Sunday his government will give provisional provincial status to part of Kashmir, drawing condemnation from India, which has long objected to any such changes by Islamabad.
Khan's proposal would apply to Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan's only land link to China, which is the northern part of the larger Kashmir region. Both Delhi and Islamabad have claimed all of Kashmir since gaining independence 73 years ago, and have fought two wars over the territory.
""We have made a decision to grant provisional provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan, which has long been the demand here,"" Khan said in a speech in the city of Gilgit.
Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Shri Anurag Srivastava said Delhi ""firmly rejects the attempt by Pakistan to bring material changes to a part of Indian territory, under its illegal and forcible occupation.""
Last year India angered Pakistan by announcing changes to the status of Kashmir, taking away some of the region's privileges. Although Pakistani officials made no link between India's prior move and Khan's proposals, the Pakistani action is likely to be viewed in both countries as a partial tit-for-tat response.
Both sides control parts of Kashmir, which is divided between them by a United Nations-mandated ""Line of Control"". UN observers are still stationed in the region. 
Kashmir has carried a vague constitutional status in both countries since 1947 to accommodate for a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution on the dispute. While full details were not immediately disclosed, Khan's proposal appears likely to bring the region closer to the status of Pakistan's other federating provinces. 
Khan said the decision was within the scope of the UNSC resolution. He gave no time-frame for its implementation. Such a move would require a constitutional amendment in Pakistan, which must be passed by two-thirds of Pakistan's parliament.
Khan's visit to the area comes ahead of an election for a Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly, to be held on November 15. The body, created in 2009, has few powers, and the region is largely governed directly by Islamabad.
India's foreign ministry has already objected to the election, saying Pakistan illegally occupies the territory. 
Strategically located Gilgit-Baltistan, with an estimated population of 1.2 million, borders Afghanistan and China, and is at the heart of the $65 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor infrastructure development plan.

Similar plans by Islamabad to adjust its status were previously shelved over concerns that it would adversely impact Pakistan's case in the United Nations for full control over Kashmir.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian security forces killed the chief of the largest militant group in Kashmir in a gun battle on Sunday, as the disputed region is riven by violence more than a year after New Delhi withdrew its semi-autonomy.
The killing takes the number of militants killed in the Muslim-majority region so far this year by Indian troops to 190, police official Vijay Kumar told Reuters.
Saiful Islam Mir, commonly known as Saifullah, chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen militant group, was shot dead in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar, Kumar said. 
Saifullah took over the leadership of the group in the portion of Kashmir controlled by India after its previous chief there, Riyaz Naikoo, was killed in a gun battle with Indian troops in May.
The overall head of the Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen is militant commander Syed Salahuddin, whom Washington placed on a list of global terrorists in 2017.
India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full but rule in part. New Delhi has long accused Pakistan of supporting an armed insurgency in the Himalayan territory, a charge Islamabad denies.
Last August, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government reorganised the state of Jammu and Kashmir, splitting it into federally-administered territories, promising better governance.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down development work, and members of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been increasingly targeted by militants.
Last week, three young BJP workers were shot dead by militants in southern Kashmir.

The overture comes ahead of demonstrations that opposition has called for on Monday to protest against the poll's results. 
""I will be the servant of all Tanzanians. I would like to thank my fellow presidential contestants for participating,"" Magufuli said at a function in the capital Dodoma where he formally accepted the results.
According to results announced by the country's poll body on Friday, Magufuli secured 84% of the vote against his leading opponent Tindu Lissu's 13%. 
""I promise to work with you to ensure we are pushing for the national development. Development is non-partisan ... politics is not a war, politics is not a conflict, we are all Tanzanians."" 
On Saturday Lissu's CHADEMA party and another opposition party ACT-Wazalendo rejected the results, called for protests and demanded a fresh poll be held.
The United States has said it was concerned about reports showing ""systematic interference in the democratic process"" during the election.
The vote was marred by allegations of irregularities, including the use of force against unarmed civilians, pre-ticking of ballots, the detention of opposition officials and restrictions on political party agents accessing polling stations, the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam said.
Nicknamed the ""Bulldozer"", Magufuli is praised by some for pushing through big-impact infrastructure projects and a sweeping anti-corruption campaign. 
But his critics accuse his government of intolerance and authoritarianism that has included a crackdown on critical voices, closure of some media outlets and preventing opposition rallies.

Officials deny the accusations.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said on Sunday his troops would ""go to the end"" should negotiations fail to result in an agreement by ethnic Armenian forces to withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding regions.
Aliyev, speaking during a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in the Azeri capital Baku, also said Armenia had ""no basis"" to request Russian military assistance in the conflict.
Further shelling was reported by Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces in and around Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday. The death toll in the region's worst fighting in more than 25 years has already surpassed 1,000 and is possibly much higher.
Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.
The conflict has brought into sharp focus the increased influence of Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan, in a former Soviet region considered by Russia to be within its sphere of influence. Russia also has a security alliance with Armenia. 
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has asked Russia to outline the extent of the support it could expect from Moscow.
In response, Russia's foreign ministry said on Saturday it would provide ""all assistance required"" should the conflict spill onto ""the territory of Armenia"" - land that is outside the current conflict zone.
Aliyev, quoted by state news agency Azertag, said he wanted to resolve the conflict through negotiations that would result in the withdrawal of ethnic Armenian forces.
""Otherwise,"" he said, ""we will continue by any means to restore our territorial integrity and ... we will go to the end.""
Azerbaijan's advances on the battlefield since fighting began on Sept. 27 have reduced its incentive to strike a lasting peace deal and complicated international efforts to broker a truce. Three ceasefires have failed to hold.
The ethnic Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh military said that missiles been targeted at the town of Martuni, the village of Karin Tak and the city of Shushi, just 15 kilometres (9 miles) from the enclave's largest city, Stepanakert.
Armenia's defence ministry said a second militant from Syria had been captured on the battlefield. Azerbaijan has previously denied the presence of foreign fighters. 
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said its army units in Tovuz, Gadabay and Gubadli had come under shelling overnight. Combat on Sunday was concentrated in Aghdere, Aghdam, Gubadli and Khojavend - the Azeri name for Martuni.
Nagorno-Karabakh's army says 1,166 of its soldiers have been killed since Sept. 27 and the office of Nagorno-Karabakh's human rights ombudsman said the civilian death toll was 45.

Azerbaijan, which does not disclose its military casualties, says 91 civilians have been killed. Russia has estimated as many as 5,000 deaths on both sides.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - At least five people died and many others were wounded in election day clashes in opposition strongholds in Ivory Coast, officials said on Sunday. 
The country was spared the kind of widespread violence that many feared would erupt during voting on Saturday, as President Alassane Ouattara seeks a third term that his opponents say is unconstitutional.
Opponents of 78-year-old Ouattara say he is breaking the law by running again because the constitution limits presidents to two terms, and risks shattering the fragile peace that has been in place since a civil war killed 3,000 people in 2010-11. 
The streets of the country's economic engine, Abidjan, were quiet on Sunday, as they had been on election day, as many stayed at home for fear of violence. Some had already left the commercial capital for villages in the provinces ahead of the vote. 
However, some areas did see violence, and the atmosphere remained tense ahead of partial results expected on Sunday. 
""Young armed men from the surrounding villages ... fired on the other young people,"" said Germain N'Dri Koffi, mayor of the town of Tiebissou in the centre of the country, the heartland of opposition candidate, former president Henri Konan Bedie. 
Four were killed and 27 injured by bullets and machetes, he said. One other person was killed in the pro-Bedie town of Niable, a government official said on condition of anonymity. 
Opposition candidate Pascal Affi N'Guessan said on Sunday that 12 people had died, without providing details.
The towns affected are not major producers of cocoa, of which Ivory Coast is the world's top grower. However, some buyers told Reuters on Sunday that middlemen were avoiding trips into rural areas of cocoa-growing regions for fear of violence. 
Ouattara says he can run again under a new constitution approved in 2016, and is doing so only because his handpicked successor died unexpectedly in July. 

Bedie and Affi had urged supporters to boycott the vote. That is expected to hand Ouattara victory, but may undermine the legitimacy of a third term.

""It’s time that we come out to protect our beloved monarchy,"" said Bin Bunleurit, a former film star turned rescue volunteer who had encouraged people to demonstrate at the Grand Palace in Bangkok.
""Everyone has the right to advocate for whatever change they want, but what is the reason they want to reform the monarchy?""
The Palace has made no comment since the start of the protests in mid-July.
Protesters say King Maha Vajiralongkorn's powers are too great and want to reverse changes that gave him personal control of some army units and a palace fortune valued in the tens of billions of dollars.
They criticise the king's long stays in Germany as wasteful and accuse the monarchy of enabling decades of army domination by accepting coups such as the one in which Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took power in 2014. 
Student and youth-led protests initially sought the removal of Prayuth, but have become the greatest challenge to the monarchy since the end of absolute royal rule in 1932.
The biggest protests have drawn tens of thousands of people, many times more than the royalists have brought out, even including accompanying members of security forces who are also ordered to wear yellow - the king's colour.
Suwit Thongprasert, a defrocked Buddhist monk and royalist leader, welcomed the size of the crowd on Sunday. 
""It is a signal to those who want to abolish the monarchy to think of the people,"" he told reporters.
Prayuth's government banned protests last month and arrested many of the best known leaders, but the emergency measures were cancelled after they backfired by drawing many more people onto Bangkok streets.
Three high-profile protest leaders were hospitalsed over the weekend after police said they were being re-arrested at the expiry of the limit to their detention. One of them passed out in police custody in scenes that angered protesters.

Prayuth has said he will not resign and rejects accusations that elections last year were engineered for his benefit.

The death toll from Friday afternoon's quake rose to 51. Turkish authorities have announced 49 deaths in the coastal city of Izmir, while two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos.
The man, identified as Ahmet Citim, was rescued from the rubble of the residential ""Riza Bey"" building, one of the 20 residencies that collapsed during the earthquake.
Officials said 20 buildings were destroyed in Izmir's Bayrakli district which was in the process of urban transformation due to lack of earthquake resistance.
Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey.
The Friday earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centered in the Aegean Sea, northeast of Samos.
President Tayyip Erdogan said 885 people had been injured, 15 of them critically. 
""I WILL PLAY VIOLIN FOR YOU""
Sixteen-year-old Inci Okan was trapped under the rubble of the same 8-story building as the elderly man before being rescued 17 hours after the strong quake, along with her dog Fistik (Pistachio).
Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca and National Medical Rescue Team (UMKE) member Edanur Dogan visited Okan at hospital.
Emergency worker Dogan had held the girl's hand while rescue teams removed the debris above her. 
""I am very happy. Thankfully my father was not at home. My father couldn't fit there. He would hurt his head. I am tiny. I am short so I squeezed in and that's how I was rescued. We stayed home with my dog. Both of us are well,"" Okan said from her hospital bed.
Okan promised to play the violin for Dogan after being discharged from hospital.

""I will play the violin for you, I promise.""

The latest arrests took place on Saturday, the source said. 
An assailant shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest) beheaded a woman and killed two other people in a church in Nice on Thursday, in France's second deadly knife attack in two weeks with a suspected Islamist motive.
The suspected attacker, a 21-year-old from Tunisia, was shot by police and is now in critical condition in a hospital.
The latest arrests in the case involved two men from the town of Grasse, near the southern French coast close to Nice, BFM TV reported. 
France's chief anti-terrorism prosecutor has said the man suspected of carrying out the Nice attack had arrived in Europe on Sept. 20 in Lampedusa, the Italian island off Tunisia.
Investigators in Italy are also stepping up enquiries about the suspected assailant's movements and contacts on the island of Sicily. They believe he may have spent time there after going from Lampedusa to Bari in early October on a ship used to quarantine migrants, judicial sources said. 

In Bari, he is believed to have been handed an expulsion order obliging him to leave Italy within a week, the judicial sources said. Investigators are looking into the possibility the suspected attacker stayed in the Sicilian town of Alcamo for a 10 day period, the sources added.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - When Lebanon's financial crisis pushed Vartkes to leave for Armenia this summer, he never imagined he would volunteer to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh.
The young Lebanese-Armenian didn't think twice, however, when the conflict between Azerbaijani and ethnic Armenian forces erupted soon after his move. 
""I wanted to go that night,"" Vartkes, who asked not to be identified by his last name, said by phone. He has yet to be called to back troops in the region, which is recognized as part of Azerbaijan though governed by ethnic Armenians.
""I feel like I have to do something for the country.""
An Armenian defence ministry official has said many from the diaspora applied to volunteer without giving a precise number. Hundreds from as far afield as Argentina and the United States have rushed back to Armenia for combat training, a local instructor says. 
The fighting, some of the deadliest in the mountain enclave in more than 25 years, has prompted mass mobilisation across Armenia and seen its vast global diaspora spring into action. 
In Lebanon, a community of nearly 140,000 of Armenian origin, one of the world's largest, has fundraised and sent aid despite a crippling currency crash. Many have had roots in Lebanon since their ancestors fled mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire a century ago.
Karapet Aghajanyan, the combat instructor in Yerevan, who trains local and foreign volunteers, told Reuters around 10 Lebanese-Armenians have received training in his camp.
He said they arrived from Beirut after the fighting broke out in late September to go to the frontline. 
Scores of Lebanese of Armenian descent were already leaving Beirut for Yerevan months before the fighting, members of the community say. Lebanon's economic collapse, and then the huge Beirut port explosion that killed nearly 200 people in August, have fuelled migration. 
Lebanese MP Hagop Pakradounian, who heads the Armenian Revolutionary Federation party, said there was no organisation registering or sending any volunteers from Lebanon.
He said no more than 20 people had gone from Beirut to sign up, acting on their own. It was not clear if any were called to battle.
""We cannot prevent them at the end of the day. We try to dissuade them but they have this impulse,"" he said. ""It's an existential war for the Armenian people, that's why some youths are going.""
The violence has raised fears of a wider conflict dragging in Turkey, which backs Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia. 
Azerbaijan rejects any solution that would leave Armenians controlling the enclave. Armenians refuse to withdraw from territory they view as part of their historic homeland. 
On a main highway out of Beirut, white banners hung from bridges read: ""Stop Azeri aggression.""
In Lebanon's largely Armenian town of Anjar, the head of the municipality, Vartkes Khoshian, said even families worried about paying bills had donated.
""The people gave more than they had,"" he said. ""We all follow news minute by minute.""
This month, Anjar commemorated one of their own who was killed in battle, Kevork Hadjian, an opera singer born in the Lebanese town who lived in Armenia. 
Many residents saw him as a hero.
The singer's 74-year-old mother, Sosse Hadjian, said she had spent days watching TV, weeping over slain fighters. But she didn't know her son was at the front until her brother delivered the news of his death.

""I'm a mother who lost a son after all. It's really hard,"" she said. ""But I'm also proud he joined for Armenians, for the homeland.""

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Protesters in Mexico burned effigies of Donald Trump and a border patrol agent on the U.S. border on Saturday, condemning President Donald Trump's migration policies and urging Americans to reject him at the ballot box on Tuesday.
A few dozen migrant activists marched to the beach fence separating Mexico from the United States at the border city of Tijuana chanting, ""Trump, we won't pay for your wall,"" then set fire to a crude, besuited effigy of the president on a stick.
""We're calling on people to vote against Trump and in favor of hope. Biden has promised us a humanitarian migration reform, we'll be watching to ensure the promises are kept this time,"" said Hugo Castro, a Mexican-American migrant activist.
Trump, a Republican, is battling Democratic opponent Joe Biden, seeking re-election as president four years after he won office pledging to stop illegal immigration from Mexico, which he has accused of sending rapists and murderers north.
Insisting Mexico will pay for the border wall he is building between the two countries, Trump has pushed and threatened President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador into tightening up Mexico's borders against migrants from Central America.

Alongside the Trump effigy, the demonstrators torched a pinata of a border patrol agent, a week after a Mexican man was killed in an altercation with U.S. officials attempting to cross into the United States on the Tijuana-San Diego border.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Algerians vote on constitution with president in hospital,"By Hamid Ould Ahmed and Lamine Chikhi
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Polls opened in Algeria on Sunday in a referendum on constitutional changes pushed by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and the powerful military as a way to turn the page on last year's popular unrest. 
The referendum is seen as a test of strength for both Tebboune and the leaderless opposition ""Hirak"" protest movement that brought thousands of people onto the streets weekly to demand radical change, and which rejects the vote. 
Tebboune, who has been in hospital in Germany since last week after saying aides had tested positive for COVID-19, has pushed for a big turnout, which would demonstrate popular support for his strategy of moving on from the demonstrations.
In a statement late on Saturday to commemorate the anniversary of Algeria's war of independence from France, read out on his behalf because of his absence in Germany, he again urged people to vote. 
However, there was little evident enthusiasm for the ballot on Sunday morning amid strict health measures because of the global pandemic.
""There is no point in voting. This constitution will not change anything,"" said 30-year old bus driver Hassan Rabia, sitting with two friends at a cafe in central Algiers.
At the Ali Chekir school at Ouled Fayet west of Algiers, about 10 people were waiting to vote. ""Let's hope for the better and pray for Tebboune's speedy recovery,"" said Ahmed Slimane, 60. 
Referencing Tebboune's hospitalisation in Germany, a cartoon in el Watan newspaper showed a man standing at a polling booth and sweating, looking at ballots marked 'yes' and 'no' in German rather than in Algeria's official languages of Arabic and French. 
Tebboune has presented the changes as addressing - at least in part - the wishes of the protesters who last year forced his predecessor Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down after 20 years in office. 
However, their demands - replacing the ruling elite that has governed since independence in 1963, the military's withdrawal from politics and an end to corruption - have been at best only partly met. 
Many of Bouteflika's closest allies and other top officials, including his brother Said and the former intelligence chief Mohamed Mediene, as well as major business tycoons, have been jailed on corruption charges. 
The new constitution includes presidential term limits and more powers for the parliament and judiciary. 
However, the military remains the most powerful institution in Algerian politics, though it has played a less prominent role since Tebboune's election. 

The new constitution gives it a new power - the right to intervene outside Algeria's borders under certain conditions, with the generals concerned about insecurity in neighbouring Libya and Mali.

MANILA (Reuters) - A super typhoon weakened after barrelling through the southern part of the Philippines' main island of Luzon on Sunday, with officials reporting at least four deaths, power supply outages, infrastructure damage and flash floods. 
The weather bureau downgraded Goni, the world's strongest storm so far this year, to typhoon category, with 215 kph (140 miles per hour) sustained winds and gusts of up to 290 kph (180 mph) after it made landfall in the Bicol region. 
Tropical storm-wind alerts were lowered, but the weather agency warned in its 0300 GMT bulletin that Goni still posed a threat while traversing provinces south of the capital Manila.
Goni made two landfall in two places in the Bicol region, where four deaths were reported, said provincial Governor Al Francis Bichara, including one hit by a tree and a five-year-old washed away after a river overflowed.
The disaster management agency could not confirm the report.
Video footage by news channels and on social media showed rivers overflowing and some dikes destroyed, submerging villages in Bicol.
Bichara also received reports of volcanic mud flows, as well as electricity supply and communication service outages.
In Quezon, Governor Danilo Suarez said power supply was cut in 10 towns as Goni toppled trees.
Between 19 million and 31 million people could be affected by the typhoon, including those in danger zones and in metropolitan Manila, the disaster management agency said.
About 347,000 people were in evacuation centres, said disaster management chief Ricardo Jalad, lowering the figure of nearly a million reported by the agency on Saturday.
President Rodrigo Duterte was monitoring the government's disaster response from his southern hometown Davao city, according to presidential spokesman Harry Roque.
Health officials reminded those in evacuation centres to observe social distancing as the coronavirus spread is also a concern.
Dozens of international and domestic flights have been cancelled as the civil aviation authority ordered a one-day closure of Manila's main gateway, the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.
Goni is among the strongest typhoons to hit the Philippines since Haiyan, which killed more than 6,300 people in 2013.
It follows Typhoon Molave, which hit the Philippines last month killing 22 people, mostly through drowning in provinces south of Manila.
The weather bureau said it was also monitoring another cyclone, tropical storm Atsani, which could hit northern Luzon provinces in the coming days.

Ardern earlier this month delivered the biggest election victory for her centre-left Labour Party in half a century. Although she no longer needs support from other parties to govern, coalitions are the norm in New Zealand as parties look to build consensus.
On Saturday, Ardern said her new government would be announced on Monday, offering the Greens two ministerial portfolios, but also included enhanced provisions that allow the coalition partner more freedom.
""What's unique here is that we're both agreeing that we actually don't have to agree,"" Ardern told reporters in televised remarks at the signing ceremony on Sunday.
The Greens are obliged to back the government over decisions made in their portfolios but are otherwise entitled to take a different position to Labour.
""I'm again really proud that we have a good mandate, because it shows that this is a cooperation agreement that is a win-win for the Greens,"" the Green Party's co-leader Marama Davidson said.

Prior to the October election, the Labour Party was in a governing coalition also with the Greens and New Zealand First.

The New York Times reported on Friday that U.S. border authorities have been expelling migrant children from other countries to Mexico, fueling tensions on an issue that has strained U.S.-Mexico ties under the Trump administration.
Mexico's government reacted by saying it would look into the report, but has not confirmed any cases.
""At present there is no register of minors entering Mexican territory without being accompanied by their relatives,"" Roberto Velasco, a senior foreign ministry official, wrote on Twitter.
Velasco said Mexico would continue to investigate the matter alongside civil society groups and multilateral organizations.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Mexican official said U.S. authorities were not allowing Mexico to review who was being expelled from the United States. Efforts were underway to negotiate a solution to the issue, the official added.

According to the newspaper, the expulsions were set out in an internal email from a senior U.S. Border Patrol official, and breached the terms under which Mexico agreed to help Washington impose tougher border controls to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

The arrests, which took place early in the morning, did not appear to be directly linked to the law but come as police have arrested around 30 under the legislation in recent months.
Police did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Lawmakers Wu Chi Wai, Andrew Wan, Helena Wong, Kwok Wing Kin, Eddie Chu, Raymond Chan and Fernando Cheung announced their arrests on their individual Facebook pages.
Beijing imposed the national security law on its freest city on June 30, a move widely condemned by Western governments and human rights groups. The law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

Critics of the legislation say it represents the latest move by Beijing to tighten its grip over the former British colony and erode its judicial independence.

In Paris, mayor Anne Hidalgo also joined a growing wave of support for independent booksellers, saying in an interview published on Sunday that she would bring in local authorisations for them to remain open. 
The French government put in place fresh restrictions on Friday to combat a resurgence in COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations, echoing a two-month shutdown earlier this year. This time, schools will remain open but all non-essential stores are supposed to close. 
In the small town of Yerres, shops such as shoe-sellers remained open under a local edict. 
""I think you're taking much less risk going to buy your book or your shoes or your clothes in a small shop where there aren't many people than in a big superstore,"" the mayor, Olivier Clodong, told Reuters, adding he found it unfair that hypermarkets, which sell food, could stay open. 
Police paid a visit to grooming parlour in Yerres where a dog was being shampooed, but they did not issue an on the spot fine. Authorities have said they will be tolerant at the start of the lockdown, which began on Friday.
About 20 other mayors brought in similar measures in other parts of France on Saturday, TV network BFM TV said. 
The revolt has particularly centered on booksellers. 
""Along with other cities, we will take a joint initiative, following the one taken already in Dijon, to allow independent book stores to reopen,"" Paris mayor Hidalgo told the Journal du Dimanche (JDD) newspaper. 
She also called on the government to allow museums to stay open, with rigorous sanitary protocols and caps on visitors. 
A book store in Yerres, as well as many in central Paris, tried to remain open by operating 'click and collect' services that allow people to pick up books ordered online or on the phone at the door. 
Also in an interview with the JDD, junior economy minister Olivier Dussopt said the government - which is rolling out support for businesses including reduced welfare bills and partial unemployment schemes - would stick to its plan to reassess the situation for retailers in two weeks' time. 
""The edicts brought in by the mayors are illegal and they know it,"" Dussopt said.

The decision on Monday to postpone the choice of a new leader had stoked internal divisions in the party, with one candidate - Friedrich Merz - accusing some in the CDU establishment of opposing him for the job.
The party's three leadership candidates - Merz, Armin Laschet and Norbert Roettgen - have agreed to hold the congress in mid-January, CDU general secretary Paul Ziemiak announced on Twitter.
""Unity in the CDU is important for Germany, particularly in such difficult times,"" Ziemiak said, adding that the candidates all prefer a meeting in person, but if that is not possible, they appeal for an online meeting with digital voting.
The final details will be hammered out by the party's leadership on Dec. 14, he said.
Top CDU officials had expressed concerns about party cohesion and discipline - usually a strength - going into election year 2021, especially as Merz strengthened the fears by crying foul over the postponement of the party congress.
At stake is the leadership of Europe's biggest economy in the era after Merkel, who has vowed not to run again at elections due next autumn after looming large on the European stage since 2005 and proving a winner with German voters.
The CDU's popularity has been boosted by Merkel's competent handling of the pandemic, with far lower infection rates in Germany than in neighbouring countries.
Opinion polls show Merz is more popular with CDU members than Laschet, who is premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Roettgen, a foreign policy expert. But the party elite, to whom the delegates are close, favour Laschet.

Germany must hold its next federal election by Oct. 24, 2021 at the latest.

The Dominican Republic's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday it was evaluating the step at the request of the local Jewish community, noting that its embassy in Israel had been in Jerusalem until 1980.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi praised the Dominican Republic and expressed gratitude to his Dominican counterpart Roberto Alvarez Gil for considering it.
""I thanked him during our phone call yesterday for this important decision and for the many years of friendship between our two countries,"" Ashkenazi said on Twitter.
The announcement came just two months into a new Dominican administration led by President Luis Abinader, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants. Since taking power, Abinader has described as ""very special"" the country's relationship with the United States, the Dominican Republic's main trade partner.
Coming just a few days before a U.S. presidential election, the Dominican declaration followed on the heels of other Latin American countries that have recently moved their embassy to Jerusalem or are considering it.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who is seeking re-election on Tuesday, enraged the Palestinians and angered many world leaders by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in late 2017, and the U.S. embassy moved there the following year.
Guatemala moved its embassy to Jerusalem soon afterwards, and Honduras has said it aims to do the same by the end of 2020. Brazil is also mulling the move.
Jerusalem's status has been one of the thorniest issues in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of a future state. Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector it annexed after the 1967 war, as its capital.

A day after daily coronavirus infections hit a record high, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said the measures would cover 121 municipalities, including the key regions of Lisbon and Porto. The affected areas are home to about 70% of Portugal's population of roughly 10 million.
The lockdown list includes municipalities where more than 240 new infections have been registered per 100,000 people for the past 14 days, and will be reviewed every 15 days, Costa said in a televised news conference.
""If nothing is done, the rise in infections will inevitably lead us to a situation of failure of our health system,"" he said.
""We have a very tough month ahead of us. It is more likely we will add more municipalities than we drop from that list next time,"" he said.
Portugal has recorded a comparatively low 141,279 infections and 2,507 deaths, but daily cases hit a record 4,656 on Friday before retreating to 4,007 on Saturday, when the death toll rose by 39. 
A total of 1,972 people are in hospital after a non-stop increase in hospitalisations over the past two weeks, with 286 people in intensive care units.
The health system, which prior to the pandemic had the lowest number of critical care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe, can accommodate 800 COVID-19 patients in ICUs.

Movement between Portugal's municipalities had already been prohibited between Friday and Nov. 3 to reduce risk of virus transmission during the All Saints holiday.

(Reuters) - Scottish movie legend Sean Connery, who shot to international stardom as the suave, sexy and sophisticated British agent James Bond and went on to grace the silver screen for four decades, has died aged 90.
""His wife Micheline and his two sons Jason and Stephane have confirmed that he died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by family,"" family spokesperson Nancy Seltzer said on Saturday.
Connery was raised in near poverty in the slums of Edinburgh and worked as a coffin polisher, milkman and lifeguard before his bodybuilding hobby helped launch an acting career that made him one of the world's biggest stars.
“Sean was a global legend but, first and foremost, he was a patriotic and proud Scot,"" said Scottish First Minster Nicola Sturgeon.
Connery will be remembered first as British agent 007, the character created by novelist Ian Fleming and immortalized by Connery in films starting with ""Dr. No"" in 1962.
As Bond, his debonair manner and wry humour in foiling flamboyant villains and cavorting with beautiful women belied a darker, violent edge, and he crafted a depth of character that set the standard for those who followed him in the role.
He would introduce himself in the movies with the signature line, ""Bond - James Bond."" But Connery was unhappy being defined by the role and once said he ""hated that damned James Bond"".
Tall and handsome, with a throaty voice to match a sometimes crusty personality, Connery played a series of noteworthy roles besides Bond and won an Academy Award for his portrayal of a tough Chicago cop in ""The Untouchables"" (1987).
He was 59 when People magazine declared him the ""sexiest man alive"" in 1989.
Connery was an ardent supporter of Scotland's independence and had the words ""Scotland Forever"" tattooed on his arm while serving in the Royal Navy. When he was knighted at the age of 69 by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 2000 at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, he wore full Scottish dress including the green-and-black plaid kilt of his mother's MacLeod clan.
BECAME FED UP WITH 'IDIOTS'
Some noteworthy non-Bond films included director Alfred Hitchcock's ""Marnie"" (1964), ""The Wind and the Lion"" (1975) with Candice Bergen, director John Huston's ""The Man Who Would be King"" (1975) with Michael Caine, director Steven Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" (1989) and the Cold War tale ""The Hunt for Red October"" (1990).
Fans of alternative cinema will always remember him starring as the ""Brutal Exterminator"" Zed in John Boorman's mind-bending fantasy epic ""Zardoz"" (1974), where a heavily moustachioed Connery spent much of the movie running around in a skimpy red loin-cloth, thigh-high leather boots and a pony tail.
Connery retired from movies after disputes with the director of his final outing, the forgettable ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" in 2003.
""I get fed up dealing with idiots,"" he said.
The Bond franchise was still going strong more than five decades after Connery started it. The lavishly produced movies, packed with high-tech gadgetry and spectacular effects, broke box office records and grossed hundreds of millions of dollars.
After the smashing success of ""Dr. No,"" more Bond movies followed for Connery in quick succession: ""From Russia with Love"" (1963), ""Goldfinger"" (1964), ""Thunderball"" (1965) and ""You Only Live Twice"" (1967).
Connery then grew concerned about being typecast and decided to break away. Australian actor George Lazenby succeeded him as Bond in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" in 1969.
But without Connery it lacked what the public wanted and he was lured back in 1971 for ""Diamonds Are Forever"" with temptations that included a slice of the profits, which he said would go to a Scottish educational trust. He insisted it would be his last time as Bond.
Twelve years later, at age 53, Connery was back as 007 in ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983), an independent production that enraged his old mentor, producer Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli.
PREFERRED BEER TO MARTINIS
In a 1983 interview, Connery summed up the ideal Bond film as having ""marvellous locations, interesting ambiance, good stories, interesting characters - like a detective story with espionage and exotic settings and nice birds."" 
Connery was a very different type from Fleming's Bond character with his impeccable social background, preferring beer to Bond's vodka martini cocktails that were ""shaken not stirred"".
But Connery's influence helped shape the character in the books as well as the films. He never attempted to disguise his Scottish accent, leading Fleming to give Bond Scottish heritage in the books that were released after Connery's debut.
Born Thomas Connery on Aug. 25, 1930, he was the elder of 
two sons of a long-distance truck driver and a mother who worked as a cleaner. He dropped out of school at age 13 and worked in a variety of menial jobs. At 16, two years after World War Two ended, Connery was drafted into the Royal Navy, and served three years.
""I grew up with no notion of a career, much less acting,"" he once said. ""I certainly never have plotted it out. It was all happenstance, really.""
Connery played small parts with theatre repertory companies before graduating to films and television.
It was his part in a 1959 Disney leprechaun movie, ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People,"" that helped land the role of Bond. Broccoli, a producer of the Bond films, asked his wife to watch Connery in the Disney movie while he was searching for the right leading actor.
Dana Broccoli said her husband told her he was not sure Connery had sex appeal.
""I saw that face and the way he moved and talked and I said: 'Cubby, he's fabulous!'"" she said. ""He was just perfect, he had star material right there.""

Connery married actress Diane Cilento in 1962. Before divorcing 11 years later, they had a son, Jason, who became an actor. He married French artist Micheline Roquebrune, whom he met playing golf, in 1975.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. special forces rescued an American citizen who had been kidnapped by armed men in an operation on Saturday in northern Nigeria that is believed to have killed several of his captors, U.S. officials said.
Forces including Navy SEALs rescued 27-year-old Philip Walton, who had been abducted on Tuesday from his home in neighboring southern Niger, two U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity, adding that no U.S. troops were hurt.
A diplomat source in Niger said Walton is now at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Niamey. 
""Big win for our very elite U.S. Special Forces today,"" U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News that the Trump administration had over the years rescued 55 hostages in 24 countries.
The Pentagon confirmed the operation but did not provide the identity of the hostage.
Walton, who kept camels, sheep and poultry and grew mangoes near the border with Nigeria, was kidnapped by six men armed with AK-47 assault rifles who arrived on motorcycles at his home in southern Niger's Massalata village early on Tuesday.
His wife, young daughter and brother were left behind. 
Reuters has reported that the perpetrators appeared to be from the Fulani ethnic group, and that they spoke Hausa and some English. They demanded money and searched the family's home before leaving with Walton.
Niger, like much of West Africa's Sahel region, faces a deepening security crisis as groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State carry out attacks on the army and civilians, despite help from French and U.S. forces.
Four U.S. soldiers were killed in an ambush in Niger in 2017, sparking debate about the United States' role in the sparsely populated West African desert that is home to some of the world's poorest countries.

At least six foreign hostages are being held by Islamist insurgents in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Islamists have collected millions of dollars in ransom payments in recent years. The U.S. government has frequently criticized other countries for paying.

On Friday, Tanzania's National Electoral Commission declared Magufuli the winner of Wednesday's poll, with 84% of the vote against 13% for his opponent, Tundu Lissu of the Chadema party.
""We are calling on the international community and bodies not to recognise what was referred to as a general election, and we call on them to take appropriate action,"" Chadema chairman Freeman Mbowe said in comments posted on the party's Twitter account.
""We demand fresh elections as soon as possible.""
Mbowe, who led the opposition in parliament, urged opposition supporters to demonstrate on Monday against the handling of the election, which Lissu has called a ""travesty"". 
Zitto Kabwe, a leader of ACT-Wazalendo, along with Mbowe, was among dozens of opposition candidates who lost their seats in parliament to the ruling CCM party. ACT-Wazalendo on Saturday joined the calls for protests against the result.
In his bid for a second term, Magufuli promised to boost the economy by completing infrastructure projects started in his first term, such as a hydro-electric dam, a railway line and new planes for the national carrier.
But the opposition and rights groups have complained that his administration has cracked down on critical voices, closing down media outlets and preventing opposition rallies.
The main challenger, Lissu, was shot 16 times in 2017 in what remains an unsolved case.
The government has denied stifling dissent.
The United States has said it was concerned about ""reports of systematic interference in the democratic process"" during the election. 
The vote was marred by allegations of irregularities, including the use of force against unarmed civilians, pre-ticking of ballots, the detention of opposition officials and restrictions on political party agents accessing polling stations, the U.S. Embassy said.
But, in a preliminary statement, the East African Community's Election Observer Mission said that the electoral commission had ""organised the elections in a professional manner"".
Government spokesman Hassan Abbasi could not be reached when Reuters sought comment on Saturday.
On Wednesday, the electoral commission denied allegations of fake ballots, saying they were unsubstantiated.

CCM won more than 200 of the 264 constituencies that were up for a vote on Wednesday, according to the privately-owned Mwananchi newspaper.

The man, who was not named and who was detained on Friday, posted messages on social media in support of the Oct. 16 murder of Samuel Paty, Catalan regional police said.
Paty was killed outside his school in a Paris suburb by an 18-year-old Chechen who was apparently incensed by the teacher showing a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad in class. Police shot the attacker dead. 
""Police officers from the Mossos d'Esquadra have arrested a man of Moroccan nationality, for an alleged crime of exaltation of terrorism and a crime of incitement to commit terrorist crimes,"" Catalan police tweeted. 
The suspect appeared before a court in Barcelona on Saturday and was released on condition he surrender his passport and appear before magistrates every 14 days, police said. 
An attacker killed three people in a church in Nice on Thursday in the second deadly knife attack in France in two weeks. Three people have been taken into custody.
The attacks came amid growing Muslim anger across the world over France's defence of the right to publish cartoons depicting the prophet.
French President Emmanuel Macron has deployed thousands of soldiers to protect sites such as places of worship and schools, and ministers have warned that other Islamist militant attacks could take place.
Police will guard French schools in the Spanish region of Catalonia from next week.

PARIS (Reuters) - A third person was taken into custody in France in connection with a knife attack which left three dead in Nice on Thursday, a police source said on Saturday, as the government ramps up security efforts against possible militant attacks. 
An assailant shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest) beheaded a woman and killed two other people in a church in Nice, in France's second deadly knife attack in two weeks. 
The third arrest took place on Friday and followed another that day and a previous one on Thursday, the police source said. At least two of the people in custody, including one Nice resident, were being investigated over suspected contacts with the attacker, judicial sources have said. 
The suspected assailant was shot by police and is now in critical condition in a hospital.
President Emmanuel Macron has deployed thousands of soldiers to protect sites such as places of worship and schools, and ministers have warned that other Islamist militant attacks could take place.
The Nice attack, on the day Muslims celebrate the Prophet Mohammad's birthday, came amid growing Muslim anger across the world over France's defence of the right to publish cartoons depicting the prophet. 
On Oct. 16, Samuel Paty, a school teacher in a Paris suburb, was beheaded by an 18-year-old Chechen who was apparently incensed by the teacher showing a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad in class.
Protesters have denounced France in street rallies in several Muslim-majority countries, and some have called for boycotts of French goods.
An interview with Macron on the TV network Al Jazeera, in which he addresses some of these tensions, is due to air later on Saturday, the French president's office said. 
By reaching out directly to Muslim audiences, Macron is keen to counter what he sees as a misinterpretation of his recent statements on Islam and explain France's often misunderstood secularist model, people close to him said. 
Macron also spoke to Pope Francis on Friday, following the attack at the Notre-Dame Catholic basilica in Nice, the President's office said, and discussed the importance of freedom of speech and of dialogue between religions. 
""He (Macron) stated he would continue to fight against extremism so that all French people can express their faith in peace and without fear,"" his office said. 
ITALIAN INVESTIGATION
France's chief anti-terrorism prosecutor has said the man suspected of carrying out the Nice attack was a Tunisian born in 1999 who had arrived in Europe on Sept. 20 in Lampedusa, the Italian island off Tunisia.
Prosecutors in the Sicilian city of Palermo, in Italy, are investigating the man's subsequent passage through the island, including the people he might have been in touch with there, and are requisitioning phone records, judicial sources told Reuters.

Investigators are looking into the possibility that the suspect arrived in the Italian city of Bari in early October, on a ship used to quarantine migrants, before leaving for Palermo, the sources said.

TRENCIN, Slovakia (Reuters) - Long queues formed outside coronavirus testing centres in Slovakia on Saturday, as the country embarked on a bid to test most of the country's 5.5 million inhabitants over a single weekend.
Up to 20,000 medics plus support teams including soldiers staffed around 5,000 sites to administer the antigen swab tests.
""We didn't think twice, we were clear since the beginning we would go even if we didn't have to,"" said Katarina Hegerova, 73, after lining up with her husband in drizzle for over an hour at a site outside Trencin, a city north of the capital Bratislava.
Slovak media reported similarly long queues at other sites.
Authorities say the ambitious plan to slow the infection's spread by testing most citizens aged 10 and over in just two days is the biggest of its kind in a country of comparable size.
Prime Minister Igor Matovic has said he hopes it will avert a strict lockdown, by identifying large numbers of infected individuals and quarantining them.
Slovakia reported 2,573 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday through molecular PCR testing, raising the total to 57,664, with 219 deaths.
The faster antigen test being administered nationwide this weekend gives results in just 30 minutes but is less accurate than the PCR method.
The testing is free and voluntary, but the government will impose lockdowns on people who do not participate. 
Matovic said that as of 9 a.m. on Saturday, 97% of the testing teams were complete.
""Everyone who wants to take part in testing will be served. Do not go to sites where long lines form... They will be empty in late afternoon and tomorrow,"" he said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Opponents of the scheme have questioned whether it makes sense given the time and resources involved, and possible large numbers of false results.

A second round of testing is planned for a week's time, to catch those errors, and for people who miss out this weekend or get infected in the interim.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian president Joko Widodo on Saturday condemned what he called ""terrorist"" attacks in France, but also warned that remarks by President Emmanuel Macron had ""insulted Islam"" and ""hurt the unity of Muslims everywhere.""
Conservative Islamic organizations in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, have called for protests and boycotts against France, sharing an image of Macron as a red-eyed devilish snail.
""Freedom of speech that injures the noble purity and sacred values and symbol of religion is so wrong, it shouldn’t be justified and it needs to stop,"" the Indonesian leader, who is known by his popular name Jokowi, said in a televised address. 
He added, however, that ""linking religion to acts of terrorism is a massive mistake. Terrorists are terrorists.""
A knife-wielding Tunisian man shouting “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greatest) beheaded a woman and killed two other people in a church in the French city of Nice on Thursday. The attack came less than two weeks after a middle-school teacher in a Paris suburb was beheaded by an 18-year-old attacker who was apparently incensed by the teacher showing a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad in class.
Macron has vowed to stand firm against attacks on French values and freedom of belief, but some of his comments both prior to and after the recent attacks - including calling Islam ""a religion in crisis all over the world"" - have proved controversial.
Jokowi did not specify which of Macron's comments he was referring to in his address on Saturday. 
An Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Saturday the ministry had summoned the French ambassador on Tuesday over remarks by Macron they said ""insulted Islam"" and the fact he allowed publication of the cartoons.

Tens of thousands of Muslims in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia, and the Palestinian territories protested against France on Friday.

IZMIR (Reuters) - Turkish rescue workers searched through rubble for survivors on Saturday, as the death toll from a powerful earthquake that hit the Aegean Sea the previous afternoon rose to 27.
Officials in the city of Izmir said 25 people were killed in coastal areas in Turkey's west, while two teenagers - a boy and a girl - died on the Greek island of Samos after a wall collapsed on them.
At least 20 buildings in the city were destroyed, authorities said, and the rescue work was punctuated by frequent aftershocks.
Bulldozers were removing debris from collapsed buildings, and rescuers were dismantling walls to reach those stuck under the rubble, television images and videos showed. 
Environment Minister Murat Kurum said some 100 people had been rescued so far.
More than 800 people were injured in Turkey, and the area had been hit by some 470 aftershocks, the country's disaster agency said. 
In central Izmir, rescuers were seeking to save a mother and her four children from the remains of a building. Relatives waited outside another collapsed building. 
One Izmir resident, who didn't want to be named, said both her parents were still trapped. ""I couldn't get any news. I couldn't get any news,"" the woman told Reuters, when asked about attempts to reach them. 
Search and rescue operations were complete in eight buildings, while operations continued in nine others, officials said.
The leaders of Turkey and Greece - caught up in a bitter dispute over exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean - spoke by phone late on Friday. 
In a rare show of warmth between the two countries, Turkish and Greek leaders exchanged solidarity messages. 
""I just called President (Tayyip Erdogan) to offer my condolences for the tragic loss of life from the earthquake that struck both our countries. Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted.

""I offer my condolences to all of Greece on behalf of myself and the Turkish people. Turkey, too, is always ready to help Greece heal its wounds. That two neighbours show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life.""

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Armenia and Azerbaijan once more accused each other of bombing residential areas on Saturday, in defiance of a pact to avoid the deliberate targeting of civilians in and around the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Shelling was reported by both sides within hours of the latest agreement to defuse the conflict, reached after talks in Geneva between the two countries' foreign ministers and envoys from France, Russia and the United States.
The agreement with the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group fell short of what would have been a fourth ceasefire since fighting began on Sept. 27. The death toll in the worst fighting in the South Caucasus for more than 25 years has surpassed 1,000 and is possibly much higher.
Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war in the region.
The Nagorno-Karabakh Emergency and Rescue Service said the central market in Stepanakert, the enclave's largest city, had come under fire and that large parts of it had been burned.
Shushan Stepanyan, spokeswoman for the Armenian defence ministry, also said several civilians had been wounded in attacks on the strategic city of Shushi, 15 km (9 miles) to the south of Stepanakert.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry denied both accusations. It said that the regions of Terter, Aghdam and Aghjabedi had come under artillery fire, as had Gubadli, a town between the enclave and the Iranian border that was taken by Azeri troops this week.
More than 1,000 fighters from the Nagorno-Karabakh army have been killed. Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military casualties, while Russia has estimated as many as 5,000 deaths on both sides.
Three ceasefires have failed to halt the fighting, the most recent brokered in Washington last Sunday by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The OSCE Minsk Group said Armenia and Azerbaijan had also agreed to exchange the bodies of fighters and to provide within a week lists of detained prisoners of war, with the aim of an eventual exchange.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgians voted for a new parliament on Saturday in an election seen as a test of credibility for the ruling party and a way to form a more diverse parliament.
Voting, which got under way at 0400 GMT, was brisk, with lines forming outside several polling stations in the capital Tbilisi.
A fifth of Georgian territory remains under the control of pro-Russian separatists following a short war with Russia in 2008.
The country's economy was hit by the spread of the coronavirus and is now forecast by the government to contract by 4%.
A majority of polls suggest the ruling Georgian Dream party - founded and funded by the country's richest man, Bidzina Ivanishvili - is leading, but it is not clear whether it will be able to get more than 40% of the votes needed to form a single-party government.
The ruling party leaders said they were confident of victory and promised to hold a free and fair election.
""We have an information that a turnout is high, our supporters are very active and we expect to receive over one million votes,"" Irakli Kobakhidze, the ruling party executive secretary, told reporters.
Reuters correspondents saw long queues outside polling stations in central Tbilisi with voters wearing protective masks due to the coronavirus concerns.
""No coronavirus will prevent me to make my choice, I'm ready to stand here for hours as I want changes in our country ... this government should go,"" Petre Lomsadze, 31-year-old resident of Tbilisi, said.
Many other Georgians accuse the government of mishandling the economy, selective justice, weak foreign policy and falling short of democratic standards, including brutal dispersal of protests.
The opposition says that the outcome of the upcoming poll should not set a precedent of the ruling party being elected for a third consecutive term.
""Opposition will win and it will be a decisive victory, oligarchic governance should be over,"" said Tina Bokuchava, a lawmaker from the opposition United National Movement (UNM), referring to Ivanishvili.
Critics accuse Ivanishvili, who does not occupy any government posts and is only Georgian Dream party head, of governing the South Caucasus country of 3.7 million people behind the scenes.
More than 30 opposition parties, led by the UNM, the largest and strongest opposition force, on Friday vowed not to form a coalition government with the ruling party after the election.
Polls suggest that the distribution of 30 majoritarian seats in 150-seat parliament may play a decisive role and indicate that more diverse voices will be presented in the next parliament. Those seats are filled through voting for individual candidates in electoral districts, as opposed to party lists used for the remaining 120 seats.
Both the government and the opposition would like to see Georgia join the European Union and NATO, but such a move would be strongly resisted by Moscow. Georgian Dream also favours stronger ties with Russia.
Polls will close at 8 p.m. (1600 GMT). The election are monitored by local and limited number of international observers due to pandemic concerns.

Results of four separate exit polls commissioned by private television channels will be announced right after polls close, while first preliminary results are expected to be announced by the Central Election Commission early on Sunday.

IZMIR, Turkey (Reuters) - Nineteen people were killed in Turkey and Greece after a strong earthquake struck the Aegean Sea on Friday, bringing buildings crashing down and setting off tidal waves which slammed into coastal areas and islands.
People ran onto streets in panic in the Turkish city of Izmir, witnesses said, after the quake struck with a magnitude of up to 7.0. Neighbourhoods were deluged with surging seawater which swept debris inland and left fish stranded as it receded.
Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said 17 people died, one due to drowning, while 709 people were injured. On the Greek island of Samos two teenagers, a boy and a girl, were found dead in an area where a wall had collapsed.
Search and rescue operations continued at 17 collapsed or damaged buildings in Izmir, AFAD said. Authorities were setting up tents with a total capacity of 2,000 people near areas with the highest damage, Urbanisation Minister Murat Kurum said.
Ilke Cide, a doctoral student who was in Izmir's Guzelbahce region during the earthquake, said he went inland after waters rose following the earthquake.
""I am very used to earthquakes ... so I didn't take it very seriously at first but this time it was really scary,"" he said, adding the earthquake had lasted for at least 25-30 seconds.
Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Turkey is among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude quake struck Izmit, a city southeast of Istanbul. In 2011, a quake in the eastern city of Van killed more than 500.
FLOODING
Ismail Yetiskin, mayor of Izmir's Seferihisar, said sea levels rose as a result of the quake. ""There seems to be a small tsunami,"" he told broadcaster NTV.
Footage on social media showed debris including refrigerators, chairs and tables floating through streets on the deluge. TRT Haber showed cars in Izmir's Seferihisar district had been dragged by the water and piled on top of each other.
Idil Gungor, who runs a hotel in Izmir's Seferihisar district, told broadcaster NTV that people were cleaning the debris after the floodwaters receded. She said fish had washed up on the garden of the hotel, around 50 metres (55 yards)from the shore.
Residents of the Greek island of Samos, which has a population of about 45,000, were urged to stay away from coastal areas, Eftyhmios Lekkas, head of Greece's organisation for anti-seismic planning, told Greece's Skai TV.
""It was a very big earthquake, it's difficult to have a bigger one,"" said Lekkas.
High tidal wave warnings were in place in Samos, where eight people were also injured, according to a Greek official.
""We have never experienced anything like it,"" said George Dionysiou, the local vice-mayor. ""People are panicking."" A Greek police spokesman said there was damage to some old buildings on the island.
The leaders of Turkey and Greece - caught up in a bitter dispute over exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean - spoke by phone and expressed hopes that both countries would see a speedy recovery from the quake, Turkey's presidency said.
Both leaders said they were ready to help the other country if needed and emphasised the importance of solidarity.
""Whatever our differences, these are times when our people need to stand together,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis wrote in a tweet.
""That two neighbors show solidarity in difficult times is more valuable than many things in life,"" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan wrote in a tweet responding to Mistotakis.
Cooperation between the two countries after the devastating 1999 earthquake led to a period of warmer ties between them.

AFAD put the magnitude of the earthquake at 6.6, while the U.S. Geological Survey said it was 7.0. It was felt along Turkey's Aegean coast and the northwestern Marmara region, media said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Some students at Thailand's Thammasat University posed with cardboard cutouts of well-known critics of the monarchy on Saturday in a protest as King Maha Vajiralongkorn was to present degrees amid growing calls for royal reform.
Youth and student-led demonstrations that began in July by demanding the ousting of former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister have increasingly called for curbs on the king's powers, breaking a longstanding taboo.
State broadcaster Thai PBS quoted a source as saying only around half of this year's 9,600 Thammasat graduates joined rehearsals that are essential for those attending the degree ceremony. Last year, it said, only 10 percent missed the final ceremony.
The Palace has made no comment since the protests began. Prayuth warned students on Friday not to disrupt the graduation ceremonies at Thammasat, long seen as a centre of radicalism.
Student protesters set up life-size cardboard cutouts of historian Somsak Jeamteerasakul and former diplomat Pavin Chachavalpongpun, widely followed critics of the monarchy who live in self-exile.
""I chose to take a picture with Somsak because I respect him and I don’t think he deserves whatever happened to him for speaking the truth and bravely criticising the monarchy openly,"" said one 23-year-old student, who gave his name as Marut.
Some students posed with a cardboard cutout of Bernard, a well-known nut seller on the campus for decades. Many students, at the ceremony with their families, ignored the cutouts.
The university did not respond to a request for comment.
The graduation ceremony with accompanying photos is a rite of passage in Thailand.
Many families display gilt-framed pictures of graduates receiving degrees from the monarch, a practice begun last century to strengthen royal bonds with the middle class.
This year's protests have challenged the prestige of the Palace to the greatest extent since the 1932 revolt that ended absolute monarchy.
A week long government crackdown in mid-October, with a ban on protests and the arrest of many protest leaders, backfired when it prompted bigger demonstrations.
Three of the best known protest leaders were re-arrested overnight after the expiry of the limit for keeping them detained. Pictures of one of them being carried unconscious from a police van fuelled protesters' anger.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said it believed Panupong ""Mike Rayong"" Jadnok, 24, had been put in a chokehold by police. Police spokesman Kissana Phatanacharoen told Reuters ""he had a reaction and so was sent to the hospital,"" describing the arrest procedures as ""normal"".

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",New Zealand PM Ardern to announce government on November 2,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Saturday she will announce her new government on Monday after offering the Green Party two ministerial portfolios outside of cabinet as part of a proposed cooperation agreement.
Ardern delivered earlier this month the biggest election victory for her centre-left Labour Party in half a century. Although she no longer needs support to govern, coalitions are the norm in New Zealand as parties look to build consensus.
Under the agreement offered to the Green Party - one of Ardern government's coalition partners prior to the election - the two portfolios would be held by the Green Party's co-leaders. 
James Shaw would be minister for climate change and would be associate environment minister, while Marama Davidson would become the minister for the prevention of family and sexual violence. 
""On election night I said I wanted to govern for all New Zealanders and to reach as wide consensus on key issues as possible,"" Ardern said at a televised news conference. ""This agreement does that."" 
In return, Ardern said, the Greens would not oppose the government on confidence and supply votes. They would also support Labour on procedural motions in the parliament. 
The Green Party would be able to take their own position on issues not covered by the ministerial portfolios and areas of co-operation.
The cooperation deal could still be rejected by the Green Party membership who were to vote on it on Saturday, but Ardern said she would announce the composition of the government on Monday regardless of the Green Party's decision.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2020 01:55AM ET</span>",Hong Kong media boss distances himself from contentious Hunter Biden-China report,"(Reuters) - Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai said he personally had ""nothing to do with"" a report on alleged China business links of the son of U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden, but admitted funds from his private firm had been used to fund it.
Lai, a prominent democracy advocate in Hong Kong and a staunch China critic, said on Twitter that he was ""sorry"" that his flagship newspaper, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily, had been implicated in an article by U.S. media outlet NBC.
In the article, NBC alleged that a 64-page document circulating on the internet about the purported connections of Hunter Biden to the Chinese Communist Party and his business dealings in China had ""questionable authorship and anonymous sourcing"".
The article cited the co-author of the ""intelligence document"", Christopher Balding, as saying the document had been ""commissioned by Apple Daily"", which the paper said in a statement were ""false allegations"".
Balding, an academic, didn't immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
While Lai said that his newspapers had not personally commissioned the 64-page document, he admitted that his senior executive, Mark Simon, had ""worked with the project"".
""Mark used my private company’s money to reimburse for the research he requested. It’s only US$10,000 so he didn’t have to have my approval,"" Lai added on Twitter. 
""I know it is hard for anyone to believe that I didn’t know about it and my integrity is damaged.""
In a statement posted online, Simon said he had resigned because of the incident, and apologised for having ""allowed damage to Jimmy on a matter he was completely in the dark on"".
He gave no further details when contacted by Reuters.
The Apple Daily recently published two articles on Hunter Biden and his ties to a Taiwanese businessman who the paper said was a purported broker ""enabling Hunter Biden’s deals in mainland China over a decade"".
But the paper said in a statement that these stories had been carried out by its own journalists in Taiwan with independent verification of their own findings, and were separate from the 64-page document.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine officials on Saturday ordered evacuation of thousands of residents in the southern part of the main Luzon island as a category 5 storm that is the world's strongest this year approaches the Southeast Asian nation.
Typhoon Goni, with 215 kph (133 miles) sustained winds and gusts of up to 265 kph (164 mph), will make landfall on Sunday as the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines since Haiyan that killed more than 6,300 people in November 2013.
Pre-emptive evacuations have started in coastal and landslide-prone communities in the provinces of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur, while Albay provincial government would order residents in risky areas to leave their homes, Gremil Naz, a local disaster official, told DZBB radio station. ""The strength of this typhoon is no joke.""
Typhoon Molave last week killed 22 people, mostly through drowning in provinces south of the capital Manila, which is also in the projected path of Goni, the 18th tropical storm in the country.
Authorities are facing another hurdle as social distancing needs to be imposed in evacuation centres to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Philippines has the second highest COVID-19 infections and deaths in Southeast Asia, next only to Indonesia.
Relief goods, heavy machinery and personal protective equipment are already positioned in key areas, Filipino Grace America, mayor of Infanta town in Quezon province, told DZBB radio. ""But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, our funds for calamity concerns and expenses are insufficient.""
Local officials cancelled port operations and barred fishers from setting sail.
Typhoon Goni, moving westward at 20 kph (12 mph) from the Pacific Ocean, will bring intense rains over the capital and 14 provinces nearby on Saturday evening, and threats of floods and landslides.
Another typhoon, Atsani, is gaining strength just outside the Philippines. Around 20 typhoons hit the Philippines every year.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 10:10PM ET</span>",Mexican president picks first woman to head security ministry,"By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president has chosen a woman to lead the security ministry for the first time, tasking her with bringing to heel heavily armed drug gangs that have fueled chronic violence and caused tens of thousands of deaths.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday he wanted Rosa Icela Rodriguez, a loyal political ally who is currently in charge of Mexico's ports, to become security minister, replacing powerful incumbent Alfonso Durazo.
Rodriguez, a former journalist who cut her teeth in public administration in various posts during successive left-leaning Mexico City governments, is regarded as politically astute, as well as close to Lopez Obrador's wife, Beatriz Gutierrez.
Before taking charge of the ports in July, Rodriguez was Mexico City interior minister under Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, earning plaudits for keeping order when the capital had to cope with unparalleled curbs against the coronavirus this spring.
""She did a good job in charge of the Mexico City interior ministry,"" said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, praising her appointment.
Rodriguez is largely untested at a national level, and few jobs have proven more taxing than improving security.
Announcing his decision during a regular news conference, Lopez Obrador said he did not yet know whether Rodriguez would accept the post, because she was still recovering from COVID-19.
She faces a daunting task, with homicides reaching record levels on Lopez Obrador's watch in spite of his pledge when he took office in December 2018 to reduce violence.
Benitez said he hoped Rodriguez would be less prone to trying to put a positive spin on crime statistics, and believed that having a woman in charge could give her more clout in tackling rising femicides, or gender-based murders of women.
Outgoing minister Durazo is stepping down to run for the governorship of the northern state of Sonora in 2021.
Rodriguez's nomination comes just a few days after a scandal engulfed the armed forces with the arrest in Los Angeles of former defense minister Salvador Cienfuegos on drugs charges.
Putting Rodriguez in charge of security should act as useful check on the military, which had threatened to accumulate more and more power until Cienfuegos' arrest, security expert Benitez said.

How she fared would depend heavily on her relations with intelligence chiefs and the National Guard, the militarized police force Lopez Obrador created to tackle the cartels, he added.

MILWAUKEE/ROCHESTER, Minn. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Friday sought support in Midwestern states where the coronavirus has roared back, with Trump falsely accusing doctors of profiting from COVID-19 deaths while Biden said Trump had surrendered to the pandemic.
Trump criticized Democratic governors who have imposed restrictions that aim to slow the virus's spread, and said Biden would prohibit Americans from gathering for holidays or other special occasions if elected. Many of those who came to see him did not wear masks.
""You've got to open up your state and you've got to do it fast!"" Trump said at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, with just four days to go before the election. 
At a later event in Rochester, Minnesota, he greeted hundreds of supporters who were locked out of a rally that was limited to 250 participants by state authorities. 
Trump also trained his ire on the U.S. medical system, falsely saying that doctors are somehow incentivized to drive up the death count. 
""Our doctors get more money if someone dies from COVID,"" he said in Waterford Township, Michigan.
Biden accused Trump of ""giving up"" in the fight against the virus and said he should not attack medical personnel who are treating its victims.
""Unlike Donald Trump, we will not surrender to this virus,"" he said at a rally in St. Paul, Minnesota. Supporters, socially distanced in their cars at the state fairground, and honked their horns in agreement.
​ The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed nearly 230,000 people in the United States and cost millions more their jobs, has dominated the final days of the campaign. 
A record surge of cases is pushing hospitals to the brink of capacity. The news pushed Wall Street to its worst week since March, undercutting one of Trump's main arguments for re-election.
Trump, who recovered from COVID-19 weeks ago, has played down the health crisis for months, telling supporters in recent weeks that the country is ""turning the corner"" even as cases surge. Biden has warned of a ""dark winter"" ahead and promised a renewed effort to contain the virus.
Biden leads Trump 52% to 42% in Reuters/IPSOS national opinion polling, partly because of widespread disapproval of his handling of the pandemic. Opinion polls show a closer contest in the most competitive states that will decide the election.
The focus on the upper Midwest underlined the region's importance in the race. Michigan and Wisconsin were two of the three historically Democratic industrial states, along with Pennsylvania, that narrowly voted for the Republican Trump in 2016, delivering him an upset victory. 
Biden leads Trump by 9 percentage points in Michigan and Wisconsin and 5 points in Pennsylvania, according to Reuters/IPSOS polling.(https://polling.reuters.com/)
'DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED'
Minnesota, which has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1972, is one of the few Democratic states that Trump is trying to flip this year. Biden said his visit was not a sign he was worried about the state, where he has held a steady lead. Trump was due to visit later in the day.
The pandemic and an extraordinary level of enthusiasm have prompted Americans to vote early in unprecedented numbers.
More than 86 million votes have been cast either by mail or in person, roughly 63% of the total number of votes in the entire 2016 election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.
In Texas, a traditionally Republican state where polls show Biden and Trump close, more than 9 million people have cast ballots, eclipsing total turnout from 2016, the Texas secretary of state's office said. Texas is the second state, along with Hawaii, to already surpass its 2016 total. 
Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that mail-in ballots are susceptible to fraud, and has more recently argued that only the results available on election night should count.
Early voting data show that far more Democrats have voted by mail, while Republicans are expected to turn out in greater numbers on Tuesday.
This means preliminary results from states like Pennsylvania that do not begin counting mail-in ballots until Election Day could show Trump in the lead before flipping as more Democratic-heavy ballots are added.
Last-minute legal battles have added to the uncertainty.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court said Minnesota's plan to count ballots that arrive after Election Day was illegal. That ruling came after the Supreme Court allowed North Carolina and Pennsylvania to keep similar deadlines in place.

Separately, a federal judge in Washington ordered the U.S. Postal Service to take extra steps to ensure speedy delivery of mail ballots in areas where service has been slow.

Paul Novak, a judge in Lake County, Illinois, where 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse is being held, handed down a six-page ruling denying the teen's request for release and ruled he must raise his self-defense claims in a Wisconsin court. 
The ruling was issued hours after an extradition hearing at which Rittenhouse's lawyers did not call any witnesses, despite indicating they may elicit testimony from his mother and four experts.
In addition to arguing Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, his lawyers had alleged technical errors in paperwork behind his arrest in his hometown of Antioch, Illinois, close to Kenosha, Wisconsin where the shootings took place.
Novak said he found no paperwork issues and it was not his role to judge the merits of the case under extradition law.
""These are matters that can be raised in Kenosha, Wisconsin, through pre-trial proceedings or during trial,"" Novak wrote.
John Pierce, Rittenhouse's lawyer, said on Twitter that he planned to appeal the ruling to the Illinois Court of Appeal.
""We will never surrender. Kyle will be set free and cleared of all charges,"" Pierce said.
Rittenhouse was charged with first-degree reckless homicide and five other criminal counts related to the shootings, which occurred on Aug. 25 in Kenosha, Wisconsin during civil unrest sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake.
Rittenhouse returned to his home in Antioch, Illinois after that night and was taken into custody in Lake County soon after.
Immediately after Friday's ruling, Rittenhouse was taken to the Wisconsin state line and handed over to the authorities in Kenosha, a spokesman for the Lake County Sheriff's Office said.

""He is officially in Kenosha County’s custody,"" Sergeant Christopher Covelli said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials said late Friday that the Iranian hackers behind a wave of threatening emails sent to thousands of Americans earlier this month successfully accessed voter data.
The statement, issued jointly by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), partially confirms the authenticity of a video distributed as part of a disinformation campaign that briefly drew attention when it became public last week. 
The campaign - which consisted of thousands of threatening emails sent to random U.S. voters in the name of a pro-Trump far right group - featured a video in which a hacker purported to demonstrate how they could cause havoc by breaking into a voter registration records. 
Experts who examined the footage said it amounted to little more than an attempt to scare voters about the integrity of the Nov. 3 contest, but the question of whether the hackers actually did break in anywhere had gone unanswered until now. 
CISA and the FBI confirmed Friday that ""the actor successfully obtained voter registration data in at least one state."" 
The state was not identified, although purported personal details of Alaska voters were briefly flashed on the video. The FBI, CISA, and the Alaska Division of Elections did not immediately return messages seeking comment. CISA and the FBI said the Iranian hackers also scanned a number of other states' election sites for vulnerabilities. 
Cyberscoop, which first reported https://www.cyberscoop.com/iran-election-hacking-state-websites-probe-fbi on CISA and the FBI's findings, said 10 states were scanned altogether.
U.S. officials have been on high alert over the threat of potential cyber interference in the upcoming election, which pits Republican President Donald Trump against Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

Earlier on Friday, Reuters reported that Russian hackers had this year targeted the California and Indiana branches of the Democratic Party.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan met international mediators in Geneva on Friday in the latest round of talks to resolve conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, where hundreds have been killed in more than a month of fighting.
The ministers are meeting envoys from France, Russia and the United States, co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group created to mediate a conflict that has escalated in recent days, a diplomat in the Swiss city told Reuters.
The foreign ministries of Armenia and Azerbaijan both confirmed that their respective ministers had flown to Geneva.
Human rights groups also called for an immediate halt to the use of banned weapons by both sides after confirming the use of cluster munitions either fired or supplied by Armenian forces in an attack this week on the Azeri city of Barda.
The worst fighting in the South Caucasus for more than 25 years has brought into sharp focus the increased influence of Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan, in a former Soviet region considered by Russia to be within its sphere of influence.
Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war in the region.
Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said on Twitter the country's troops had taken under their control nine more settlements. The regions to which he referred are in the southern part of the conflict zone, close to the border with Iran.
Azerbaijan's military gains since fighting began on Sept. 27 make a negotiated settlement more difficult. Aliyev has rejected any solution that would leave Armenians in control of territory claimed by both countries as part of their historic homeland.
In comments published on the prime ministerial web site, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, responding to questions from foreign media, said he believed ""the principle of 'remedial secession' should be applied to Nagorno-Karabakh"".
Remedial secession refers to the secession of a subgroup from its parent state as a remedy of last resort.
Three ceasefires have failed to halt the latest fighting, the most recent brokered in Washington last Sunday by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Sporadic fighting continued on Friday. Azerbaijan's defence ministry said military positions and settlements in the Aghdere, Khojavend and Gubadli regions had come under fire.
The ethnic Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry said it had thwarted Azeri offensives and that shelling of residential areas of towns in the enclave had resumed. It also said it had captured a fighter from Syria.
Rights group Amnesty International and New York-based Human Rights Watch said they had independently confirmed the use of cluster munitions in an attack on Barda on Wednesday. Azerbaijan has said 21 people were killed.

Both groups called for an immediate halt to the use of banned weapons. A separate report by Human Rights Watch on Oct. 23 found that Azerbaijan had used cluster munitions in at least four separate incidents.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters from across Poland joined a demonstration in Warsaw on Friday against a top court ruling last week that amounted to a near-total ban on abortion in the predominantly Catholic nation.
Defying strict rules that restrict gatherings to five people during the coronavirus pandemic, demonstrators walked through central Warsaw streets carrying black umbrellas, a symbol of abortion rights protests in Poland, and banners that read ""You won't have to walk alone"" or ""God is a woman"".
Military police lined the streets, some of them in riot gear, as the demonstration began at 1600 GMT.
It was set to be the biggest protest yet since a court ruling on Oct. 22 outlawed abortions due to foetal defects - ending the most common of the few legal grounds left for abortion in Poland and setting the country further apart from the European mainstream.
Daily protests have taken place in towns and cities across the country in the past week, and have turned into an outpouring of anger against the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government and the Roman Catholic church closely allied with the ruling party.
Far-right groups which support the court ruling also turned out in small gatherings in Warsaw on Friday, and TV footage showed police trying to keep one group away from the protesters.
The leader of the abortion rights movement in Poland, Marta Lempart, told activists to report any attacks and to resist any threats of prosecution or fines for taking part. ""We are doing nothing wrong by protesting and going out on the streets,"" she told a news conference.
After the ruling goes into effect, women will only be able to terminate a pregnancy legally in the case of rape, incest or a threat to their health.
In an effort to ease tensions, Polish President Andrzej Duda, a government ally, proposed legislation on Friday reintroducing the possibility of terminating a pregnancy due to foetal abnormalities, although only limited to ""lethal"" defects.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki pledged lawmakers would proceed with the legislation quickly, but demonstrators were unimpressed. 
""This is an attempt to soften the situation for PiS, but no sane person should fall for it,"" activist and leftist lawmaker Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus told Reuters on Duda's proposal. 
The government has accused demonstrators of risking the lives of the elderly by defying strict pandemic rules against large gatherings. Poland reported a daily record of more than 21,000 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday.
Five women were charged with organising an illegal protest in the town of Police on Thursday, which drew 850 people, regional police spokeswoman Alicja Sledziona said on Friday. 
The Catholic Church has said that while it opposes abortion, it did not push the government or the court to increase restrictions. It called for people to talk and refrain from violence this week, but declined to comment further on Friday.
PiS, however, has sought to instil more traditional and Catholic values in public life since it took over power in 2015, ending state funding for in vitro fertilisation, introducing more patriotic themes into school curricula and funding Church programmes.
Catholic anti-abortion group Ordo Iuris on Friday reiterated its support for the court ruling and opposition to the protesters, and called for calm. 
""As an institute, we must condemn any violence, no matter in which way it is perpetrated. Nothing justifies hurting another person even in the face of such social unrest,"" spokesman Maciej Grajewski said. 
Some bakeries in Poland have been selling goods decorated with a red lightning bolt, another symbol of the women's rights movement in Poland, and some have written the phone number of a hotline helping women seeking terminations in chalk on sidewalks.

PARIS/NICE, France (Reuters) - France stepped up security nationwide on Friday to guard against Islamist attacks after the fatal stabbings at a church in Nice, while protests flared in parts of the Middle East, Asia and Africa over French caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad.
President Emmanuel Macron deployed thousands of soldiers to protect sites including places of worship and schools, and the nation was at its highest level of security alert after the second deadly knife attack in its cities in two weeks.
Police were holding a 21-year-old Tunisian migrant, identified by a French police source and Tunisian officials as Brahim al-Aouissaoui, over the attack in which a man shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest) decapitated a woman and killed two other people in Notre Dame Basilica in Nice on Thursday.
The attack took place at a time of growing anger among Muslims in many countries over the issue of French cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, which they deem insulting and blasphemous.
It occurred almost two weeks after Samuel Paty, a school teacher in a Paris suburb, was beheaded by an 18-year-old Chechen. Paty had shown his pupils such cartoons in a class on freedom of expression.
France, home to Europe's largest Muslim community and hit by a string of militant attacks in recent years, has defended the right to publish such cartoons. Macron has insisted France will not compromise on its basic freedoms of belief and expression.
In Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Palestinian territories, tens of thousands of Muslims staged anti-French protests after Friday prayers.
In Islamabad, police briefly fired tear gas at protesters who broke through security blockades in a failed attempt to demonstrate at the French embassy.
In Bangladesh, marchers in the capital Dhaka chanted ""Boycott French products"" and carried banners calling Macron ""the world’s biggest terrorist"". Some burned effigies of the French president.
""Macron is leading Islamophobia,"" said Dhaka demonstrator Akramul Haq. ""The Muslim world will not let this go in vain. We'll rise and stand in solidarity against him.""
Protests also took place in India, Lebanon and Somalia.
The leader of Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said the cartoons were an aggression. He condemned the Nice stabbings, but said Western leaders also bore responsibility for such crimes because of their roles in Middle East conflicts.
EMBASSIES STEP UP SECURITY
Interior Minister Gerald Damarnin said France was engaged in a war against Islamist ideology and more attacks on its soil were likely. ""We are in a war against an enemy that is both inside and outside,"" he told RTL radio.
Nice Police Chief Richard Gianotti said any symbol of the republic or Christianity was a potential target. ""We have to be vigilant, we have to be attentive,"" he told Reuters.
French embassies were also told to step up security.
Police used a Taser and rubber bullets to overpower a man in Paris on Friday when he threatened officers with two knives after they challenged him. The motive was not immediately clear.
In Nice, residents mourned the victims of what was the second attack in the Mediterranean city in recent years. In July 2016, a militant drove a truck through a seafront crowd celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 people.
People gathered in front of the Notre Dame church to lay flowers and light candles.
""I'm from Nice and this is a tragedy once again,"" said Frederic Lefevre, 50, who wore a French national rugby shirt.
""We're a free country. Let's love freedom - that's a message to the world. No god should kill,"" he said.
France's chief anti-terrorism prosecutor, Jean-Francois Ricard, said the suspect was a Tunisian born in 1999 who arrived in Europe on Sept. 20 in Lampedusa, the Italian island off Tunisia that is a main landing point for migrants from Africa.
He arrived in Nice by train on Thursday morning and made his way to the church, where he stabbed and killed the 55-year-old sexton and beheaded a 60-year-old woman.
He also stabbed a 44-year-old woman, who fled to a nearby cafe where she raised the alarm before dying, Ricard said.
Police then arrived and shot and wounded him. 
VIDEO CALL HOME
The woman who died after raising the alarm was identified as mother-of-three Simone Barreto Silva, who moved to France from Brazil as a teenager.
""She crossed the road, covered in blood,"" said Brahim Jelloule, manager of the Unik cafe. ""She was still talking, she was saying that there was someone inside (the church),"" Jelloule told France Television.
The Notre Dame parish treasurer, Jean-Francois Gourdon, told Reuters he had been working in the church with the sexton, Vincent Loques, but left shortly before the attacker arrived.
The sexton, he said, ""was very honest, he was at everyone's service, good-humoured, liked to joke.""
In the Tunisian city of Sfax, Aouissaoui's family said he had spoken to them on a video call outside the church hours before the attack. He had shown no sign that he planned any violence, they said.
Aouissaoui had gone there looking for a place to sleep, his sister Afef said. 
Family members told Reuters they were shocked at the idea that he had committed such a violent crime. 
""My brother is a friendly person and never showed extremism,"" his older brother Yassin said. ""He respected all other people and accepted their differences even since he was a child.""

Hundreds of people wearing protective masks and standing four metres apart lit candles and formed a socially-distanced human chain between the site of the former Colectiv club and the Bucharest Court of Appeals where the trial against those responsible is still taking place on the fire's fifth anniversary.
""We should know who is guilty and people should know that the same thing can happen again at any moment and we are as unprepared now as we were then,"" said Albu, 43, who survived the fire but lost both his sister and his cousin. 
The fire broke out when fireworks used during a concert by rock band Goodbye to Gravity ignited non-fireproofed insulation foam, triggering a stampede towards the single-door exit.
Prosecutors have shown the club's owners allowed it to fill beyond capacity and that Bucharest officials gave it an operating licence while safety inspectors allowed it to run despite knowing it did not have a fire safety permit. 
A trial resulted in preliminary prison sentences last year, but the decision is on appeal. 
Badly-burned patients were treated in improper conditions in Romanian hospitals, where many contracted infections that are still hampering their recovery.
On Friday, centrist President Klaus Iohannis signed into law a bill which covers all future medical expenses of those injured at Colectiv. Albu said the legislation does not account for hundreds of non-Colectiv burn victims Romania records every year. 
Romania, which has one of the European Union's least developed healthcare infrastructures, currently has one of the EU's highest coronavirus death rates. 

""Change must start with us citizens,"" said Marian Raduna, one of the human chain organisers. ""We are the ones who tolerate corruption cases and incompetent authorities, and, sadly, we forget quickly.""

NICE, France (Reuters) - When a suspected Islamist from Tunisia killed three people this week in a church in the French Riviera city of Nice, for many residents it brought painful memories flooding back.
Four years ago, another suspected Islamist originally from Tunisia had driven a 19-tonne truck into a crowd about not far from the church, killing more than 80 people.
The church attack, coming on top of the truck assault, left many people in Nice on Friday feeling they had angry, and wanting to fight back against the people they believe are to blame.
""We've had enough,"" Nice resident Francois Bonson, 38, said at the scene of the church attack on Friday. He said his mother-in-law often visited the church, and he initially feared she was among the victims.
""We're forced to live with these foreigners who spit on us, who spit on France,"" Bonson said.
The truck attack happened on July 14, 2016 as people in Nice were watching a fireworks display to mark Bastille Day, France's national holiday.
Tunisian immigrant Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel steered the  Renault  (PA:RENA) truck into the crowd thronging the seafront Promenade des Anglais. He was shot by police. The Islamic State group said it was responsible for the attack.
Nice mayor Christian Estrosi, who was also in office at the time of the truck attack, alluded to it when he rushed to the scene of the church attack on Thursday.
""Nice, like France and maybe more than other places in France, is paying a price that's too high, becoming once again the victim of Islamo-fascism,"" he said.
Local newspaper Nice Matin wrote in an editorial in its Friday edition: ""Traumatised for ever by the night of July 14, 2016, which they would like to chase from their minds, the people of Nice are once again confronted by barbarism.""
MUSLIMS UNDER SCRUTINY
Nice's history with such violence helped explain why, on Monday, some people were in bitter, combative mood.
Boubekeur Bekri, regional vice-president of the French Council for the Muslim Faith, said he feared that sentiment could evolve into a rejection of the Muslim community.
There are around 1 million Muslims living in the Provence Alpes Cote D'Azur region that includes Nice, Bekri said.
He recalled that in Nice after the 2016 attack, veiled Muslim woman were verbally attacked in the street. 
After Thursday's church attack, he said, he noticed people shooting him suspicious looks because they recognised from his appearance that he is a Muslim. ""I'm sufficiently inured to let it go,"" he said. ""But it's niggling, you see it.""
He said that sentiment had not spilled over into overt actions or violence directed at the Muslim community. He said communities needed to come together to tackle terrorism. 
But for the time being, he said, ""People are not going to be able to come together. Instead of convergence, it may be we're heading towards some problems."" 
Jean-Francois Gourdon, parish treasurer for the Notre Dame church where the attack took place, said on Friday he tried to follow a path of compassion, but he could not do it any longer.
""Now I feel anger,"" he said.
One of the victims of the attack, the church sexton, Vincent Loques, was Gourdon's friend. He broke down in tears as he recalled comforting Loques' wife after she heard her husband was dead. 
""We've been welcoming, but we're not going to be welcoming any more,"" he said. ""We don't want to become Lebanon or a country like that.""

""It's not anti-Muslim. I just want people to respect other people. To each their place. When in Rome, you do as the Romans do.""

""We haven't made a determination. We have certain rules and regulations, you know,"" Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving on a campaign trip. 
The New York Times reported that the Republican president dropped plans to appear at the Trump International Hotel in Washington and will likely watch the returns from the White House on Tuesday evening. 
Trump faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 contest.
In an interview on Fox News Channel, Eric Trump was asked if a report that a planned election night party at Trump International Hotel in Washington had been canceled was true.
""No,"" he replied. ""We're thinking about moving it actually over to the White House. We're looking at that right now.""
The city has said the streets on blocks around the White House will be closed to parking on Election Day and the following day, with intermittent street closures possible.
""So we have a hotel I don't know if you're allowed to use it or not,"" Trump said. ""But I know the mayor has shut down Washington, D.C., and if that's the case, we'll probably stay here or pick another location.""

He said he may be traveling on Election Day.

LONDON (Reuters) - COVID-19 infections are rising so persistently in the United Kingdom that unless something can be done to reduce infections, the ""reasonable worst case"" scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded, scientists said on Friday.
Britain has recorded more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day on average over the last week, but the government has resisted a new national lockdown even as France and Germany reintroduce country-wide restrictions.
British government scientists said that numbers were heading in the ""wrong direction"".
They said the ""reasonable worst case"" planning scenario for the winter of reaching 500 deaths a day and a toll of over 80,000 is in danger of being exceeded unless infection numbers are cut, according to papers published by the government's science advisers on Friday. 
In the paper, dated Oct. 14, advisers said that the exceeding of the worst case scenario might continue for three or four weeks if infections were brought down. But since then, they have risen further.
New COVID-19 cases in England increased by around 51,900 each day last week, up nearly 50% on the week before, an official survey said on Friday. [L8N2HL5C2]
That suggested that the incidence of new infections was still rising steeply and had not levelled off, in contrast to the previous week's survey.
""The UK was one of the hardest hit countries in the world in the first wave. It would be particularly tragic if we repeat this experience,"" Professor James Naismith of the University of Oxford said, adding that the figures suggest 1% of the population of Engalnd had COVID-19.
The ""R"" number was 1.1-1.3, down from 1.2-1.4, the UK's Government Office for Science said. That means on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 13 other people.
Though the dip in reproduction ""R"" number showed that local measures were having an effect, government scientists caution that numbers of infections will not fall unless it is brought below 1. 
Foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Friday said a national lockdown in England was not inevitable as he restated his faith in the government's localised approach.
""We've seen some evidence since we started putting in place this tiered approach that the rate of increase has slowed,"" Raab told BBC TV.
The government has adopted a three-tiered system of restrictions for local areas. On Friday the government said West Yorkshire would enter the top tier of restrictions from Monday. Scotland, Wales and North Ireland run their own policies on fighting the pandemic.
Adding to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's headaches, a poll by Ipsos MORI indicated falling support for the government. It found that the opposition Labour party had overtaken Johnson's Conservatives, with Johnson himself recording his lowest net satisfaction as prime minister.

Labour were on 42%, with the Conservatives on 37%.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai police carried one of the country's most high profile protest leaders apparently unconscious from a van on Friday, as he and two others were re-arrested just as they reached the limit for their detention.
Panupong ""Mike Rayong"" Jadnok, 24, Panusaya ""Rung"" Sithijirawattanakul, 22 and Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak, 22, were all detained during a crackdown ordered on Oct. 15 to try to end months of protests against the government and calling for reforms of the monarchy.
Video images showed Panupong slumped and being carried from a police van that had brought him from Bangkok Remand Prison to the Pracha Chuen police station before being taken away in an ambulance.
Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said Panupong was not in danger but would be kept in hospital overnight. The group said it believed he passed out after being put in a chokehold in the van. Police were not immediately available for comment.
An officer had earlier said he had orders to take them from prison to the police station. A lawyer for the three said they were being taken away to be charged again, arguing that it was unlawful to do so because they had already pleaded not guilty to the same charges.
In chaotic scenes outside the police station, Parit - who stripped off his shirt - and Panusaya gave an impromptu address to scores of supporters who had gathered there. They challenged the legality of their re-arrest and pledged to keep protesting peacefully.
""No matter what happens the movement will have to continue. We don't want violence,"" Panusaya said.
They have denied all charges against them.
The three have been among the most vocal in calling for curbs on the power of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy during protests that began in mid-July. They have been charged with multiple offences from sedition to breaking emergency laws meant to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

Scores of protesters, including several protest leaders, were arrested under emergency measures that were dropped a week ago after they backfired by drawing much bigger protests.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday urged a federal judge to swiftly reject a last-minute bid by two Massachusetts men to avoid being extradited to Japan to face charges that they helped former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee the country.
The department in a court filing said Japanese agents are slated to come to the United States in the ""coming days"" to transport U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, back to Japan. 
The U.S. State Department informed their lawyers on Wednesday it had approved turning them over. They challenged that decision in court on Thursday, prompting U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani to order a delay.
Defense lawyers sought the delay, saying Japanese media told them their clients would be flown to Japan that day. But the Justice Department said there was no plan to extradite within hours of their learning of the extradition decision.
The department argued the Taylors want to re-litigate arguments against their extradition a judge already rejected. ""The Taylors' eleventh-hour bid to thwart their extradition is meritless,"" prosecutors wrote.
Defense attorney Paul Kelly sought until next week to respond, saying ""the travel schedule or convenience of Japanese officials is not our concern.""
The Taylors' lawyers have said they will ask the State Department and White House to reconsider their extradition.
Prosecutors say the Taylors helped Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.

Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a private security specialist, and his son received $1.3 million for their services.

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 02:01PM ET</span>",First Jerusalem-born American gets U.S. passport that lists 'Israel' as birthplace,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The United States on Friday issued for the first time a passport to a Jerusalem-born American with 'Israel' listed as the place of birth instead of the city.
The U.S. Ambassador to Israel presented the document to 18-year-old Menachem Zivotofsky after a change of policy by President Donald Trump that is likely to please pro-Israel supporters ahead of next week's election, but that Palestinians condemned as a violation of international law.
""You have a nation of birth – the state of Israel,"" Ambassador David Friedman told the teenager, thanking Trump for having ""set this course in motion.""
The status of Jerusalem, which contains sites holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians, is among the most contentious issues in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, both of whom claim the city as their capital.
Since Israel was founded in 1948, successive American governments declined to recognize any country as having sovereignty over Jerusalem, and State Department policy was to list only the city as a birthplace, leaving resolution of such a sensitive issue to the parties in the dispute.
But in 2017 Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and in 2018 moved the U.S. Embassy to the city from Tel Aviv, to reactions of anger and dismay including from European allies. 
On Thursday, reflecting those changes, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the passport change.
Americans born in Jerusalem can now list either 'Jerusalem' or 'Israel' as their birthplace, an embassy official confirmed.
Zivotofsky's parents had long campaigned for such a change having filed a lawsuit in 2003 in a federal court.
But in 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law that would have allowed Jerusalem-born Americans to list Israel as their country of birth, saying it unlawfully encroached on presidential powers to set foreign policy. 
The administration of Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama, argued that if the law were enforced it would have caused “irreversible damage” to America’s ability to influence the Middle East peace process. Negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians broke down in 2014.
Trump's decisions on Jerusalem have been welcomed by Israel, which claims all of the city for its capital, including East Jerusalem, which it captured in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognised by most of the international community.
But they have been denounced by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who seeks to create a future state of Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza - with East Jerusalem as its capital - to live alongside Israel under a long-standing formula known as the two-state solution.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Abbas, said the passport policy change was a violation of international laws and international resolutions.
""Attempts by Trump to impose facts on the ground in a race against time ahead of the U.S election will not alter the reality,"" he told Reuters on Friday.

The report, submitted by a parliamentary commission, alleges that Anez and some of her ministers are responsible for ""resolutions contrary to the Constitution and the laws, breach of duties, genocide, murder, serious injuries, criminal association, deprivation of liberty and the forced disappearance of people.""
Bolivia spiraled into chaos after its October 2019 election was mired in controversy amid allegations it had been rigged; Morales then resigned under pressure from security forces and protesters. 
After assuming power on Nov. 12 of last year, Anez's government came under fire for a law giving the military broad discretion in the use of force. At least 30 people were killed in protests after she took office, most of whom were MAS supporters and civilians.
Morales' MAS socialist party resumed control of the presidency when its candidate Luis Arce won elections this month. Arce will take office on Nov. 8.
The report recommending the suit will now be weighed by Bolivia's parliament, where MAS represents a majority but falls short of the two-thirds needed to approve it.

Washington said on Thursday it had sold 1.1 million barrels of previously seized Iranian oil that was bound for Venezuela, in the Trump administration's latest move to increase pressure on Tehran less than a week before the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.
""The Pirates of the Caribbean openly boasting abt(about) their booty... No one civilized brags abt stealing,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Twitter.
Iranian officials have said the seized crude oil shipments belonged to shippers and not Iran. But according to an unsealed U.S. forfeiture complaint, the fuel originated with firms tied to Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and shippers took steps to mask ownership.
The unsealing of the forfeiture complaints by the Justice Department came as the Treasury Department and State Department jointly imposed sanctions on a combined 11 different entities and individuals for their involvement in the purchase and sale of Iranian petrochemicals.
U.S. officials also said they had seized Iranian missiles shipped to Yemen. In July, Iran denied that U.S. forces had seized a boat carrying Iranian weapons to Houthi rebels in Yemen, saying the charge was aimed at extending a U.N. arms embargo on Tehran.
Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have been fighting the Yemeni government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2015. Tehran denies charges by Saudi Arabia and the United States that it gives financial and military support to the Houthis.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Why the U.S. military would welcome a decisive 2020 election win,"By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Politics aside, there is one outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election that could bring some relief to Pentagon planners: a clear-cut victory. By either candidate.
In the months preceding the election on Tuesday, U.S. military officials have been forced to contemplate the possible fallout from a contested election, including protests like those in June over racial injustice that brought the National Guard to the streets.
A contested vote could stir the kind of wild speculation that forced America's top general to assure lawmakers the military would have no role in settling any election dispute between Republican President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
A decisive result could allay such concerns by lowering the risk of a prolonged political crisis and the protests it could generate, say current and former officials as well as experts. 
""The best thing for us (the military), would be a landslide one way or another,"" said a U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, voicing a sentiment shared by multiple officials.
""It does sort of give the military a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card,"" said Risa Brooks, a professor at Marquette University focusing on civil-military relations.
A week before the election, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Biden leading Trump nationally by 10 percentage points, but the numbers are tighter in battleground states that will decide the election and gave Trump his surprise 2016 win. The coronavirus pandemic has added an element of uncertainty this year, changing how and when Americans vote.
As one of America's most respected institutions - rating far higher than Congress, the presidency and the Supreme Court in opinion polls - the U.S. military has had trouble staying on the political sidelines during a year marked by the pandemic, social unrest and actions by both presidential candidates suggesting they had the support of U.S. armed forces.
The president, who boasts about his broad support within military ranks, has declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he decides Tuesday's results are fraudulent and has proposed mobilizing troops under the 200-year-old Insurrection Act to put down unrest if he won.
""Look, it’s called insurrection. We just send them in and wedo it very easy,"" Trump told Fox News in September.
For his part, Biden has suggested the military would ensure a peaceful transfer of power if Trump refuses to leave office after the election.
U.S. Army General Mark Milley, selected last year by Trump as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been adamant about the military staying out of the way if there is a contested ballot.
""If there is, it'll be handled appropriately by the courts and by the U.S. Congress,"" he told National Public Radio this month. ""There's no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of a U.S. election. Zero. There is no role there.""
MILITARY: AN OPTION OF FIRST RESORT?
Trump has regularly turned to the military throughout his term in office for such tasks as helping to secure the southern U.S. border with Mexico and showing resolve in his response to the coronavirus, even putting an Army general at the helm of a future vaccine distribution effort. 
Peter Feaver, a national security expert at Duke University, cautioned that America's willingness to look to the military when there is a crisis could create a public expectation, however misguided, that it could also help resolve an electoral crisis. 
""If things go poorly and it's Nov. 30th and we still have no idea who the president is ... that's when the pressure on the military will grow,"" Feaver said, imagining a scenario where street protests escalate as faith in democratic process erodes.
Speculation has centered on Trump's potential deployment of active duty troops to quell protests - something the military recommended against doing in June, but which Trump can lawfully do if he chooses by invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act.
Steve Abbot, a retired Navy admiral who has endorsed Biden, said the danger that Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act ""undoubtedly concerns those who are in uniform and in the Pentagon.""
Mike Smith, a retired rear admiral who is leading a group of national security experts backing Biden, said he was concerned Trump could easily turn to the military to show strength in a post-election crisis.
""There is a significant potential for the abuse of the military,"" Smith said.
National Guard officials in a number of states have said they are in contact with police departments about what they may need in case the security situation deteriorates, but added that such planning was a part of what the military does.
""We've had a number of planning meetings, just so we have the multitude of options that might be available,"" said Army Major General Jeff Holmes, the Adjutant General of the Tennessee National Guard.
Air Force Major General Daryl Bohac, head of the Nebraska National Guard, stressed, however: ""This is not new, this is what we do year in and year out for a variety of events.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Kenyan court sentenced two men on Friday to 18 years in prison for helping gunmen from Islamist group al Shabaab storm Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in a 2013 attack that killed 67 people. 
Mohamed Ahmed Abdi and Hussein Hassan Mustafa are the only people convicted in relation to the four-day assault which showed the Somali militants could strike in one of the most secure areas of the Kenyan capital. 
They were sentenced for 18 years apiece on each of two charges brought under a national terrorism prevention act, to be served concurrently. Abdi was given an additional 15-year jail sentence for possession of materials promoting terrorism. 
""This court has to pass a sentence ... commensurate with the offence,"" Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi told the men as they stood in a Nairobi courtroom. He said the seven years they had spent on remand would be deducted from their sentences. 
Andayi said they are allowed to appeal the sentences.
The attack on the upscale mall, a favourite of Kenya's growing middle class and foreign workers, happened two years after the East African nation sent troops into Somalia following a series of kidnappings and raids on Kenyan soil.
Four gunmen died during the attack and it has never been proved there were others who escaped.
A third defendant, Liban Abdullah Omar, was acquitted in the trial, which concluded on Oct. 7. He was abducted by a group of gunmen a day later after being released from custody and his whereabouts is still unknown.
The three defendants -- all ethnic Somalis, two of whom are Kenyan citizens -- were accused of assisting the attackers.
Kenyan authorities' disorganised response to the Westgate attack damaged the country's reputation.
Soldiers and police fired at each other during a chaotic four days and footage emerged of soldiers looting the complex as bodies lay sprawled on the bloodstained floors.
Loi Awat, a writer who was at the mall, told Reuters before sentencing the convictions were scant solace for those who died and survivors like her. 
She and her two cousins were getting cash at a bank when the assault began and were trapped there for four hours amid sporadic gunfire before being rescued. 
""What sentencing would you give somebody who has planned such a thing? I can't even fathom how you pay back that,"" Awat said. ""What is justice for an atrocity?""

Al Qaeda-allied al Shabaab has staged further big attacks in Kenya, including a 2015 assault on Garissa University that killed 166 people and a 2019 attack on a Nairobi hotel and office complex that killed 21 people.

Madame Tussauds's display also includes former U.S. presidents: regardless of the outcome, Trump and his dumpster are likely to be wheeled back before long.

(Reuters) - A recent rallying cry by the ethnic Armenian leader of Nagorno-Karabakh contained a startling admission: enemy troops were no more than five kilometres (three miles) from the mountain enclave's second-largest city.
Emboldened by Turkish support, Azerbaijan has the upper hand in the bloodiest fighting in more than 25 years in the South Caucasus. In just over a month, it has retaken much of the land in and around Nagorno-Karabakh that it lost in the 1990s.
It now faces a difficult choice: advance on the symbolic city of Shusha - Shushi to Armenians - a staging post for an assault on the region's largest city, Stepanakert. Or sever Armenia's main supply corridor to the west.
But analysts say a third option - to consolidate military gains and return to the negotiating table from a position of greater strength - might be the smartest move as winter draws in.
""It's clearly Azerbaijan's war to lose,"" said Michael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Program at CNA, a U.S.-based research body. ""Armenia's position is very precarious.""
Azerbaijan's success on the battlefield gives it less of an incentive to strike a lasting peace deal, complicating international efforts to broker one. With three ceasefires already broken, analysts expect little from talks in Geneva on Friday.
At stake is the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven other regions that surround it. The territory is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.
Nagorno-Karabakh's leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, on Thursday called on citizens to repel any attack on Shushi. The city is of cultural and strategic importance to both sides, perched on high ground just 15 km (9 miles) south of Stepanakert.
""If Azerbaijan were to take it back, Stepanakert would become like another Sarajevo,"" said Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the RUSI think tank in London, referring to the city besieged during the 1990s Bosnian war.
From a military standpoint, however, analysts said a better tactic for Azerbaijan, and one likely to involve fewer casualties, would be a northward push on its western flank toward a key supply route linking Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.
Armenian defence ministry official Artsrun Hovhannisyan said this week that Azerbaijan had made an unsuccessful attempt to advance on Lachin, having already captured the region of Gubadli further south, severing Armenian access to the Iranian border.
""If Lachin is taken, that would be a strategic success for Azerbaijan and a catastrophe for the Nagorno-Karabakh defence forces,"" said Viktor Murakhovsky, a retired Russian army colonel and editor of a military magazine.
""It would be impossible (for Armenia) to deliver food, fuel and people there. In this case, the fall of Nagorno-Karabakh would be a question of time.""
TURKEY'S INFLUENCE
When the 1991-94 war ended, with around 30,000 killed, the Armenians had won control of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding regions, amounting to 13.6% of the de jure territory of Azerbaijan, according to Carnegie Europe.
Much of this land has been retaken in fighting since Sept. 27, possibly as much as 15% of Nagorno-Karabakh itself, according to Kofman - territory that he said Armenia ""does not have the means to take back"". 
Tensions between the two sides had been building over the summer and spilled into direct clashes as the outside powers that have mediated in the past - Russia, France and the United States - were distracted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the upcoming U.S. presidential election and a list of world crises.
The biggest change since the 1990s is Turkey's influence in a region that was once entirely part of the Soviet Union.
""Turkish support for Azerbaijan is what makes this situation qualitatively different from all the previous conflagrations,"" said Alex Melikishvili, a principal research analyst at IHS Markit Country Risk.
He said the presence of Turkish F-16 fighter jets at a military airfield in Ganja, Azerbaijan's second-largest city, ""represents a very tangible confirmation that the geopolitical balance in South Caucasus has changed.""
Azerbaijan, rich in oil and gas, can also afford superior firepower. In September alone, it bought $77 million worth of military equipment from Turkey, including drones that afford it an aerial superiority absent in earlier conflicts.
""Money, not people, are at war,"" said Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin. ""The Armenians have archaic, practically Soviet weaponry while the Azeri forces are buying the most modern tanks and drones.""
In the ascendancy, Azerbaijan has little military incentive to negotiate a ceasefire on terms that fall short of its demands for ethnic Armenian troops to agree to leave Nagorno-Karabakh.
A Russian defence pact with Yerevan extends only to Armenian territory outside the current conflict zone. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan told Reuters this month only a change in Turkey's stance could prompt Azerbaijan to halt military action.
Azerbaijan is potentially vulnerable, however, to counter-attack along overstretched supply lines through territory gained in the relatively flat and sparsely populated south. Combat further north, in mountains where ethnic Armenian troops are dug in, would also be harder.

""Eventually there will be a settlement, but that settlement will need to be between Russia and Turkey,"" said Kofman. ""You can't return to the 'status quo'. What's been going on for the last 30 years is over.""

No one was injured and protesters later moved back towards a gathering spot originally agreed with the authorities, police said.
Muslims around the world have protested against France and President Emmanuel Macron, who has vowed to stand firm against what he described as attacks on French values and freedom of expression by radical Islamists.
Around 3,000 protesters gathered in Islamabad, about half a km (less than a mile) from the fortified diplomatic enclave where the French Embassy is, according to a Reuters witness.
Roads leading to the enclave were blocked using shipping containers and barbed wire and were guarded by riot police, but protesters managed to climb over the blockades - prompting police to fire teargas. 
""We needed to fire teargas shells when the protesters tried to violate their agreement,"" police official Amanullah Niazi said, referring to an agreement with protest leaders that they would not progress beyond a certain point. 
The protest was organised by a traders' association, which has already announced that it would take French products off shelves across the country, and came on the day Pakistan is celebrating the birthday of Prophet Muhammad. 

Protests and gatherings marking the occasion were also held in the cities of Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar.

BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) should be quickly overhauled, get more powers to handle pandemics and expose its member states' shortfalls in health emergencies, European Union officials said on Friday.
The comments were made at a video conference of EU health ministers that endorsed an EU document on the reform of the U.N. agency which for the first time outlines a series of sweeping changes needed to boost WHO's powers and resources, as exclusively reported by Reuters in September. 
The moves followed criticisms that China and other countries did not share information on the COVID-19 pandemic in a timely fashion at its onset. 
""The current pandemic challenges us very acutely ... but it is very important that the (WHO) reform debate is held in parallel,"" German Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference.
He did not say when the reform process should begin, but stressed that as a result of the overhaul the WHO should become faster in its reaction to health crises, while its member states should share more information in emergencies.
WHO officials did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
""It is extremely important we move ahead with this reform,"" EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides told the same news conference.
After months of international pressure, an independent panel was set up in September to review the global handling of the pandemic. The process to reform the WHO would begin after that, officials had said. 
The EU draft document, which will represent the EU's position at a WHO assembly in mid-November, urges the U.N. agency to make public more quickly how and whether its member states respect their obligations on sharing information on health crises.
The United States has accused the WHO of being too close to China in the first phase of the pandemic, when critics say Beijing was slow in sharing crucial information on the new coronavirus which first appeared in the city of Wuhan.
The WHO has repeatedly dismissed these accusations.
""Transparency on who complies with the rules is fundamental,"" Kyriakides told ministers at the video conference, according to her speaking notes.
The draft document also says WHO countries should allow independent epidemiological assessments on-site in high risk zones during health crises.

Students, factory workers and pensioners answered a call by exiled opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya to launch a nationwide strike this week - a fresh move to force Lukashenko to hold new elections after months of mass protests.
The ex-Soviet country sank into crisis after opponents accused Lukashenko of rigging the Aug. 9 presidential election to extend his 26-year rule. He denies vote fraud and has held on to power, buoyed by support from traditional ally Russia. 
More than 16,000 people have been detained in a violent crackdown by security forces that has prompted Western countries to impose new sanctions on Minsk.
""If someone touches a serviceman...he must leave at least without hands,"" Lukashenko said in a televised meeting.
Protesters rallied outside several universities on Friday in solidarity with students who were expelled this week for joining the strike, footage circulating in local media showed.
Several hundred people at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics chanted ""well done!"" and applauded teachers who went on strike in solidarity with the expelled students, a video by TUT.BY showed. 
Dozens, some holding posters saying ""solidarity is our weapon"", protested near the law faculty of the university, according to a picture published by Radio Svoboda.
More than 100 people protested in front of a school in Minsk, a day after police detained the father of three students who had joined the protests.
""Support students and teachers. Remind the regime: we will not let the future of our country be ruined,"" Tsikhanouskaya said in a statement. 
Dozens of factory workers have been laid off as punishment for joining the strike, according to information given by the strike groups. 
The authorities have also closed several cafes and restaurants for supporting the strike, TUT.BY reported.
That included the Brø bakery in Minsk, whose founder Ilya Prokhorov wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that the shop had been shut by the authorities on sanitary grounds. 

Lukashenko partially closed the country's land borders, replaced his interior minister and named three security hawks to new roles on Thursday in an attempt to tighten his grip.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's leaders see Sunday's referendum on a new constitution as a key part of their strategy to move beyond last year's popular unrest, but few people in the streets seem enthused by the vote, and the opposition movement rejects it as a sham.
""Why a new constitution? Why is it so important? I have no answers,"" said Lounes Belgacem, 34, a plumber who lives in Lakhdaria outside the capital. 
Posters plastered on city walls urging Algerians to back the new constitution draw a comparison with a November 1954 uprising against French colonial rule to it as a moment of national renewal. 
""1954 - November of Liberation; 2020 - November of Change"" the posters read. 
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune - who was hospitalised in Germany this week - has pushed the referendum as part of his efforts to turn a page on the mass protests that ousted his predecessor and shook the ruling elite. 
The new constitution will limit presidents to two terms, give more powers to the parliament and judiciary and allow the army to intervene outside Algeria's borders. 
However, many supporters of the opposition ""Hirak"" street protest movement have rejected the proposed constitution, seeing it as way to distract attention from the old ruling elite's continued grip on power. 
""Popular pressure on the regime. This is how change will come,"" said Riyad Mekrez, who said he had attended every one of the weekly protests that lasted for more than a year until the coronavirus lockdown. 
""As usual, I won't vote,"" he said, expressing the Hirak view that Algerian elections are little more than charades designed to give the appearance of popular support for a system that is essentially undemocratic. 
Hirak opposed last December's election in which Tebboune won office, with 58% of the vote on a turnout of only 40%. 
Though the referendum requires only a simple majority of people who vote to pass, Tebboune and other senior figures have been pushing for a high turnout to show it has popular support. 
It has led to missteps. One government minister was forced to apologise after saying, in a meeting, that anybody who was unhappy with the new constitution ""can leave the country"". 
Meanwhile Said Chengriha, who as army chief of staff is one of Algeria's most powerful men, has campaigned for the constitution, calling for Algerians to vote in large numbers.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis said in an interview published on Friday that he is determined to root out corruption in the Catholic Church but that he is not overly optimistic because it is a centuries-old human problem.
In an interview with the Italian news agency AdnKronos, Francis also said he listens to his critics but can't allow himself to get bogged down by every negative thing they say.
""Unfortunately corruption runs in cycles. It repeats itself. Someone comes along who cleans things up but it starts again until someone else comes along to put an end to this degeneration,"" he said.
In a shock move last month, Francis fired Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a former top Vatican official, accusing him of embezzlement and nepotism. Becciu, who also has been caught up in a scandal involving the Vatican's purchase of a luxury building in London, has denied all wrongdoing.
Cecilia Marogna, a 39-year-old Italian who worked for Becciu, was released after more than two weeks in jail on Friday pending a judge's decision on an extradition request from the Vatican.
""I know I have to do it (fight corruption), I was called to do it, but it will be the Lord to decide if I did well or not. Sincerely, I am not very optimistic,"" Francis said, smiling.
He was referring to the mandate he received from cardinals who elected him in 2013 to clean up Vatican finances after a string of scandals during the pontificates of his two immediate predecessors, Pope Benedict and Pope John Paul II.
""There are cases of malfeasance, of betrayals, that wound those who believe in the Church. These people (corrupt churchmen) certainly don't behave like cloistered nuns.""
Conservative Catholics have criticised the pope, saying he sends mixed signals on issues such the pastoral care of homosexuals and those who remarry civilly without Church annulments.

""Criticism can be constructive, and if it is I take it all on board because it can lead to self-examination ... but I can't let myself be dragged down by every non-positive thing written about the pope,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - England's ""tiered"" approach to reining in the coronavirus appears to be working, Britain's foreign minister said on Friday, as France and Germany prepared rules almost as strict as their spring lockdowns and EU leaders warned of wider curbs.
Europe and the United States have emerged as the current danger zones for COVID-19, which was first identified in China in December, in a global crisis in which more than 44.94 million people have been infected and 1,178,943​ have died.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said evidence showed the localised approach appeared to be working in England.
But new infections in England, part of Britain along with Wales and Scotland, increased by around 51,900 each day last week, up nearly 50% on the week before, an official survey revealed on Friday, suggesting that new infections had not levelled off.
Asked whether a national lockdown was now inevitable, Raab said: ""No, I don't think that is right, but what we are guided by is the rate of the virus.
""We've seen some evidence since we started putting in place this tiered approach that the rate of increase has slowed,"" Raab told BBC TV.
The government has adopted a three-tiered system of curbs for local areas, though the opposition Labour Party has called for a temporary lockdown to break chains of infection.
France and Germany announced new lockdowns this week as infections on the continent passed the 10-million milestone and hospitals and intensive care units filled up again.
Bars, restaurants, sports and cultural events have been restricted or closed in several other European countries.
European Union officials said on Friday EU countries should be ready to impose even more restrictions.
""Given the very dynamic situation in all of Europe, we need to equally reduce contact in almost all European countries,"" German Health Minister Jens Spahn told journalists after a video conference of EU health ministers that he chaired.
EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said EU countries should be ready to impose further curbs.
""We need to pull through this, where needed, with restrictions on everyday life to break the chain of transmission,"" she told the video conference.
Belgium, one of Europe's worst-affected countries, recorded an average of 15,316 new infections per day in mid-October, health officials said. Austria recorded its highest daily number of infections to date.
'WRONG DIRECTION'
Gloom over the rising infections has hit financial markets. World stocks fell and oil headed for a double-digit weekly slide on Friday as COVID fears and next week's U.S. presidential election more than offset strong euro zone quarterly growth data. 
Illustrating the difficulty is reining in the virus without destroying the economy, Britain's ""eat out to help out"" discount scheme to boost spending at restaurants, cafes and pubs over the summer helped spread the coronavirus, according to a new study.
A record surge of infections in the United States is pushing hospitals to the brink of capacity and killing up to 1,000 people a day before the Nov. 3 election, in which handling of the pandemic has become the main issue.
The United States broke its single-day record for new coronavirus infections on Thursday, reporting at least 91,248 new cases, as 21 states reported their highest daily number of hospitalized patients since the pandemic started, according to a Reuters tally of publicly reported data.
""We're going in the wrong direction,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leading White House task force member and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The surge has revived some of the worst images of the first wave of the virus in March, April and May, with people on ventilators dying alone in isolation and medical staff physically and mentally exhausted.
Among the hardest hit states are those most hotly contested in the election campaign between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden, such as Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Trump has downplayed the virus since the pandemic began, ridiculing Fauci and mocking social distancing and the wearing of masks. He has repeatedly told campaign rallies the country is ""turning the corner"" on the pandemic to the delight of his mostly non-mask wearing supporters but infuriating his opponents.

Russia has also seen coronavirus cases swell in recent weeks. Authorities reported 18,283 new infections on Friday, the highest tally recorded since the pandemic began, and 355 deaths.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. Election Day approaches, residents of a New York City enclave agree that they want to make America ""normal"" again.
They just don't agree on how to get there.
On Staten Island, the only one of the city's five boroughs that President Donald Trump won in 2016, a war hero's father said he is getting flak for supporting Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
""My reason, to get some sort of normalism back to the country,"" said 73-year-old Robert Ollis. ""Let's stop fighting.""
The community united behind Ollis in 2013 after his son Michael, a U.S. Army staff sergeant, shielded a wounded Polish lieutenant from a suicide bomber in Afghanistan and died saving his life. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's second highest honor.
News of Michael's death came like a punch in the stomach to his father. ""You can't get your breath, for hours,"" Ollis said. 
In an outpouring of love, his street was renamed SSG Michael H. Ollis Way. A new Staten Island ferry is named after Michael.
But that neighborly warmth evaporated when Robert Ollis gave public support to Max Rose, a Democratic congressman fighting a tightly contested race in Staten Island and parts of southern Brooklyn.
""Our neighbors look double at us now,"" Ollis said. ""When we go to the supermarket, they look. I went into an establishment and he goes, 'I can't believe you did that for Max Rose.'
""I don't understand it,"" Ollis said of the partisanship. ""This is America. This is what my grandfather, my parents fought for.""
Ollis said he felt like a misfit after over half of Staten Islanders voted for Trump in 2016.
""It's like a fish being out of water, especially now; it never was before,"" he said.
Scott LoBaido, 55, an artist who calls himself Trump's biggest supporter on the East Coast, feels differently. In his opinion, the president saw that America's worst enemies were ""those who want to inject socialism and change everything that made this country great.""
""He's the man that stepped up, gave up his livelihood, his income, to fix it,"" he said, sipping on a martini outside his Staten Island art gallery.
LoBaido's legal assistant friend Peggy Padovano, 63, believes countries dare not take advantage of the United States under Trump.
""I feel a little bit safer with him because I feel like people are not going to want to mess with him,"" she said.
Despite their differences, the Staten Islanders all said they want to return to normal after the Nov. 3 election.
""I hope for this country's sake and for my grandchildren's sake that we get back to some peace and harmony... respecting one another, regardless of your nationality, your color or your religion,"" Ollis said.
LoBaido said, ""We just want to live and feed our kids, pay our mortgage, make sure my community is safe. It's that simple.""
If Trump loses, ""I still have bills to pay and dinner to cook and a house to clean and people to love,"" Padovano said. ""The world is not going to end either way.""

President Vladimir Putin, sitting next to Kostin this week at an investment forum, complained that the Trump administration had sanctioned Russia 46 times in the last four years.
Washington sanctioned Moscow after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to tilt the contest in Trump's favour, an allegation Moscow has denied. They have also accused it of trying to meddle in the Nov. 3 vote.
""It is hard to say which of the candidates would be better for Russia-U.S. relations,"" said Kostin, 64.
Kostin, along with some other Russian officials and companies, was put under U.S. sanctions in 2018 for 'worldwide malign activity'. 
The Kremlin, which appears to have a tepid preference for Trump, has said Russia will work with any U.S. leader. Recent statements from Putin suggest he is hedging his bets, praising and criticising both Trump and Joe Biden.
""It is not clear against whom and for what new sanctions need to be introduced (by the United States on Russia),"" said Kostin. ""For now, I believe that sanctions won't be scrapped and won't be toughened either.
""We are basing our plans on this assumption,"" said Kostin.
Trump, who has praised Putin in the past, has consistently trailed Biden in national polls for months, partly because of widespread disapproval of his handling of the coronavirus. Polls in the most competitive states, however, have shown a closer race.

The election has weighed on the rouble for months, with investors associating a victory by Biden, who has named Russia as the biggest threat to U.S. national security, with a greater risk of more sanctions.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Invasive searches on female passengers from 10 aircraft at Doha's Hamad airport violated standard procedures, a preliminary report by the Qatar government found, saying those responsible for the ""illegal actions"" have been referred to the public prosecution office. 
The incident on Oct. 2, involving at least 13 Australian women on a state-owned Qatar Airways flight who were forced to disembark, and undergo invasive physical examinations in ambulances, drew a strong reaction from Australia this week.
The search was prompted by the discovery of an abandoned newborn in a bathroom at the airport, and Australia said it was awaiting a Qatari government report.
An emailed statement from Qatar's government communications office on Friday said a preliminary investigation into ""the attempted murder of a newborn baby found in a very serious condition"", and the subsequent actions of airport authorities to examine female passengers, revealed standard procedures were violated. 
""Those responsible for these violations and illegal actions have been referred to the Public Prosecution Office,"" the statement said.
Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz Al-Thani expressed Qatar's ""sincerest apology for what some female travelers went through as a result of the
measures"", the statement said.
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne said on Friday she welcomed Qatar’s ""acknowledgement of the offensive mistreatment of female passengers"", and the apology to the women.
""The statement of the Government of Qatar is consistent with our expectations for contrition, accountability and determination to avoid any repeat of this disturbing episode,"" she said in a statement.
Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday the incident was appalling, and ""as a father of daughters, I could only shudder at the thought that any woman, Australian or otherwise, would be subjected to that"".
Hamad airport is a major international airline hub, serving tens of millions of passengers and it was the first incident of its kind, the Qatar statement said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Friday denied promoting violence by saying that Muslims have a right to ""kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past"" and criticised Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter for taking down his posts.
Mahathir, 95, a respected leader in the Muslim world, posted the comments on his blog, Twitter, and Facebook on Thursday, saying he believed in freedom of expression but that it should not be used to insult others.
Several Muslim-majority countries have denounced remarks by French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron, defending the use of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a French school classroom. The caricatures are seen as blasphemous by Muslims.
The dispute flared after a French teacher who showed his pupils satirical cartoons of the Prophet during a civics lesson was beheaded in the street by an attacker of Chechen origin. 
""Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past. But by and large the Muslims have not applied the 'eye for an eye' law. Muslims don't. The French shouldn't,"" Mahathir said in his posts. 
""Since you have blamed all Muslims and the Muslims' religion for what was done by one angry person, the Muslims have a right to punish the French,"" he said, adding he did not approve of the killing of the French teacher. 
Twitter removed the tweet about the right to kill saying it had violated the platform's rules on glorifying violence. The post was also deleted on Facebook.
Mahathir accused the media of ignoring his subsequent remarks saying Muslims had never sought revenge for the injustice against them in the past and that the French should respect the beliefs of others. 
""What is promoted by these reactions to my article is to stir French hatred for Muslims,"" Mahathir said in a statement. 
He also criticised Facebook and Twitter for removing the posts.
""To my mind, since they are the purveyor of freedom of speech, they must at least allow me to explain and defend my position."" 
Facebook said in an email Mahathir's post was removed for violating its policies on hate speech.
On Thursday, a Tunisian migrant beheaded a woman and killed two other people in a French church, prompting Macron to double down on his vow to stop conservative Islamic beliefs subverting French values. 

French officials have said the killing was an attack on the core French value of freedom of expression and defended the right to publish the cartoons.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Some students sympathetic to Thai protesters said on Friday they were boycotting graduation ceremonies led by King Maha Vajiralongkorn in a show of anger at the monarchy amid growing calls to reform it.
The ceremonies, at which the monarch personally hands out degrees, are a rite of passage for graduates and their families with photographs of the moment displayed with pride in many Thai homes.
But protests since mid-July have brought open criticism of the monarchy and calls to curb its power, defying a longstanding taboo and lese majeste laws that set a jail term of up to 15 years for criticism of the king or his family.
Suppanat Kingkaew, 23, said he was boycotting the ceremonies being held on Friday and Saturday at Thammasat University, long viewed as a hotbed of radicalism and scene of a massacre of pro-democracy protesters by royalist state forces in 1976.
""Whatever it takes so that the hall is left with the smallest number of people,"" Suppanat told Reuters. ""This is to send an indirect message that some of us are unhappy with the monarchy and we want change.""
The university did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Palace did not comment, as it has not done since protests began in mid-July.
Protests initially called for a new constitution and the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, but then demands evolved to include reducing the monarchy's power.
It was unclear how many Thammasat students would follow the boycott.
Papangkorn Asavapanichakul, 24, said he would attend.
""I want the photograph. It's a once-in-a-lifetime event,"" he said.
Degree ceremonies presided over by the king began before the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 at a time the palace sought to strengthen its relationship with a growing middle class.
They gained greater importance under the king's late father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who spent decades working to strengthen the prestige of the monarchy - which according to the constitution must be revered.
Protesters say the king's powers should be reduced and changes that gave him personal control of some army units and the palace fortune should be reversed. They also want the prime minister removed, accusing him of foul play in 2019 elections - an accusation he denies.
Of those students planning to attend the ceremonies, some said family pressure had outweighed politics.

""My mother asked me to come,"" said one 24-year-old student who gave his name only as Japan. ""I didn't really want to join it, honestly.""

Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, have been killed since fighting flared again on Sept. 27. Three ceasefires have crumbled fast.
In Baku, residents speak of military gains that have seen Azerbaijan retake some of the territory lost in the 1990s. Billboards around the city and posters in shop windows have one, unambiguous message: 'Karabakh is Azerbaijan. Karabakh is ours'.
""I feel pain for our boys,"" said Olga Ismailova, an accountant, whose son lost a friend in the latest fighting, ""but we must retake what is ours.""
Armenia, like Azerbaijan, regards Nagorno-Karabakh as part of its historic homeland and says the population there needs its protection. Azerbaijan rejects any solution that would leave Armenians in control of the enclave.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry has said 55,000 volunteers signed up in July, during an earlier skirmish, but more recent numbers are classified.
Armenia says 10,000 people volunteered to take up arms on the first day of fighting and hundreds of Armenian nationals from as far afield as Argentina and the United States have rushed back to Armenia to begin combat training.
BOOTS, CAMOUFLAGE RAINCOATS
Construction worker Ramin Aliyev, 42, lives with other exiles in a district of small, shabby houses in Baku that grew outward from an unfinished hospital used to house refugees in the 1990s.
He said that, despite his age, he had sent multiple letters asking to be drafted and to put to use experience gained while serving in an artillery unit in the Azeri exclave of Nakhchivan.
""I am ready to die for my motherland,"" he said. ""Let my children be proud of me.""
Those who cannot fight have found other ways to support. Pharmaceuticals executive Elnur Aliyev took an extended break from work to raise funds and send supplies to the front lines.
At a makeshift sorting facility provided by a local bakery, he and a dozen other volunteers pack boots, camouflage raincoats and hats into crates. They sift through piles of donated shoes and clothes for families who have fled shelling.
Aliyev said his group, one of several in Baku, had raised about $235,000 from hundreds of contributors at home and abroad.
Local radio stations dedicate much of their airtime to patriotic songs while Azerbaijan's blue-, red- and green-striped flag hangs from many balconies, often side-by-side with the flag of Turkey, its ally.
Even to the most patriotic exile, however, Baku is not home.

""Ever since I heard our village had been liberated, Baku has felt foreign to me,"" said Nemat Samedov, 33, a child when his family left. ""I have signed up as a volunteer and I am waiting to be drafted.""

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Organised 'overkill': China shows off rapid lockdown system after latest outbreak,"By Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - Days after a 17-year-old girl tested positive for COVID-19 in a remote part of western China last week, health authorities said they had tested over 4.7 million people in the region.
China's strict formula of immediate lockdowns and mass testing even at the first signs of infection has been vital to its success in controlling the disease, allowing its economy to quickly recover from the crisis, officials say.
The highly orchestrated strategy - described as ""overkill"" even by its own proponents - is unique among major economies at a time when Europe and the United States are facing a massive surge of new cases and often chaotic policies.
At the time the girl was diagnosed, the Kashgar region of Xinjiang had reported no new cases for almost 70 days. 
""China has taken the most comprehensive, strictest and most thorough control and prevention measures since the COVID-19 pandemic started,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday. 
""The facts show China's measures are effective.""
Key to the programme are factors unique to China, including the Communist Party's tight grip on all aspects of society.
Authorities have unimpeded access to personal information as part of an expansive surveillance network, which has played a major role in tracing infections.
The government has also quickly enlisted the help of businesses, which are churning out tens of millions of test kits, and tightly controls their pricing and distribution, issues which have severely set back efforts to contain the disease in other countries. 
China has reported just 2,382 cases since June. By contrast, Germany and France are set to follow Italy and Spain back into partial lockdowns, as Europe reported a record 230,000 cases in one day earlier this week, while U.S. cases are set to hit 9 million soon.
MASS TESTINGS
In August, Beijing ordered all major hospitals in the country to offer testing, and said there should be one urban testing base constructed for every million residents, with the capacity to scale up to 30,000 tests a day in a local outbreak. 
Regions are also required to share resources, in sharp contrast to the early days of the outbreak, when several cities were accused of stealing equipment from each other. 
The system, like all Chinese Communist blueprints, is highly structured around specific targets; testing teams should be able to complete a campaign within seven days.
Earlier this month, almost 11 million test results were delivered in around five days in the eastern port city of Qingdao. In Wuhan, the initial epicentre of the pandemic, over 9 million samples were taken over 10 days in May. 
The mass testings are mandatory. Some are held in outdoor sporting venues and city parks, with hundreds of people lining up.
PUTTING PEOPLE AT EASE
Epidemiologists have called into question the efficacy of the mass testing events, noting some patients require multiple tests over time to return a positive result.
The tests in Kashgar this week revealed around 38 positive cases for every million people tested. In Qingdao, a mass testing of around 10.9 million samples revealed no infections after an initial 13 cases were detected.
Testing is also costly. Wuhan's 10-day spree cost 900 million yuan ($134.27 million), according to official figures, even as the government intervened to keep costs low. 
Reuters earlier reported that Chinese hospitals had begun purchasing millions of dollars worth of testing equipment across in an unprecedented medical spending spree. [L4N2DO0A4]
But the mass testings are also a key piece of political theatre for Beijing, which faced a wave of internal criticism in the early days of the outbreak. 
""After the nucleic acid test screening, the people and administrative officials felt at ease,"" said Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist for the Chinese Centre for Disease Control, in an interview with local media.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday the United States should not become a haven for Chinese criminals' ill-gotten wealth and it denied that five people arrested in the United States for conspiring to coerce a Chinese family to go home were its law enforcement officers.
U.S. authorities charged eight people this week with conspiring to act as illegal agents for a foreign government and alleged they were working on China's behalf in a plot involving threatening letters and the use of night-vision goggles to surveil and coerce a Chinese family to return to home to face charges.
China has for years been trying to recover stolen money taken overseas as part of a crackdown on corruption. It has also tried to get international cooperation to track corrupt officials since President Xi Jinping began a war on graft nearly a decade ago.
Five of the people charged in the United States, including an American private investigator, were arrested on Wednesday in New Jersey, New York and California, while the rest are believed to be in China, U.S. Justice officials said.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing the United States should stop the ""baseless accusation and smears about Chinese efforts to pursue escaped criminals and recover stolen monies"".
""We urge the United States ... to shoulder its international obligations and promise, stop coveting after the ill-gotten gains of criminals, and don't be a safe haven for criminals and their illegal assets,"" he said.
He said the people arrested in the United States were not Chinese law enforcement officers, dismissig the charges against them as ""rumours and smears"".
China’s launched a multi-agency campaign known as ""Sky Net"" in 2014 to get fugitives abroad to return to face charges. 

The United States does not have an extradition treaty with China. It requires anyone who acting on a foreign country's behalf to register and notify the Attorney General's office.

Magufuli's CCM party, a version of which has held power in Tanzania since independence from Britain in 1961, has already retained power in the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar with 76% of the vote.
Dozens of opposition party officials and members were arrested in Zanzibar on Thursday and at least one is in hospital with severe injuries after he was beaten by the police, who have not commented on the incident. 
Magufuli has garnered 84.67% of the vote from 142 constituencies that have reported so far, just over half of the total, the state broadcaster TBC said, citing the electoral commission.
Tundu Lissu, his main challenger, has said that he won't accept the eventual election results - expected within the next few days - due to the irregularities. Lissu is running for the Chadema party.
The U.S. Embassy in the East African country said there had been ""credible allegations of significant election-related fraud and intimidation"" in Wednesday's poll in which voters were electing a president and lawmakers.
The vote was marred by allegations of arrests of candidates and protesters, restrictions on agents of political parties to access polling stations, multiple voting, pre-ticking of ballots and widespread blocking of social media, the U.S. Embassy said.
Officials at the electoral commission were not immediately available for comment on allegations of irregularities. On Wednesday, the commission denied allegations of fake ballots, saying they were unofficial and unsubstantiated.
Magufuli is seeking a second, five-year term, and has promised voters that he will boost the economy by completing ambitious infrastructure projects he started in his first term.

Zitto Kabwe, the leader of the main opposition party in Zanzibar, ACT-Wazalendo, and Chadema's leader in parliament, Freeman Mbowe, are among dozens of opposition candidates who have lost their seats to the ruling party.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan arrived in Geneva for talks on Friday to resolve a conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, where hundreds have been killed in more than a month of fighting.
The ministers are set to meet envoys from France, Russia and the United States, co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group charged with resolving a conflict that has escalated in recent days, diplomats in the Swiss city told Reuters.
The foreign ministries of Armenia and Azerbaijan both confirmed that their respective ministers had arrived in Geneva.
Human rights groups called for an immediate halt to the use of banned weapons after confirming the use of cluster munitions by Armenia in an attack on the Azeri city of Barda.
The worst fighting in the South Caucasus for more than 25 years has raised fears of a wider war that could suck in Russia and Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan. It also poses a threat to pipelines carrying oil and gas from Azerbaijan to world markets.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Turkey, which has demanded a bigger role, should be among the countries involved in talks to end the fighting.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking to journalists on Friday, said peacekeeping troops would enter the conflict zone only with the agreement of both Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war in the region.
Armenia, like Azerbaijan, regards the territory as part of its historic homeland and says the population there needs its protection. Azerbaijan rejects any solution that would leave Armenians in control of the enclave.
Three ceasefires have failed to halt the latest fighting, the most recent brokered in Washington last Sunday by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Confirming its participation in talks, the U.S. mission in Geneva said the United States ""continues to call on Armenia and Azerbaijan to stop targeting civilian areas and to implement their agreed-upon commitments to a ceasefire.""
Sporadic fighting continued on Friday. Azerbaijan's defence ministry said military positions and settlements in the Aghdere, Khojavend and Gubadli regions had come under fire overnight.
The ethnic Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry said it had thwarted Azeri offensives and that shelling at residential areas of towns in the enclave had resumed.
Rights group Amnesty International and New York-based Human Rights Watch said they had independently confirmed the use of cluster munitions by Armenian forces in an attack on Barda on Wednesday. Azerbaijan has said 21 people were killed.

Both groups called for an immediate halt to the use of banned weapons. A separate report by Human Rights Watch on Oct. 23 found that Azerbaijan had used cluster munitions in at least four separate incidents.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - After nearly five years of Brexit crisis, the European Union and Britain are making a last ditch attempt to clinch a thin trade deal that would govern nearly a trillion dollars in annual imports and exports from 2021.
The United Kingdom left the EU last January but the trade deal would kick in when it leaves informal membership - known as the transition period - in nine weeks time.
If a deal can be done before the transition period ends on Dec. 31, the two sides would sign more than 1,000 pages of international treaties covering everything from smoked salmon and cheese to car parts and medicine.
So far, there is no breakthrough, though talks in London and Brussels made progress on unifying texts each side has so far prepared separately. Sticking points remain on economic fair play, fisheries or settling disputes, sources on both sides said.
Here are three main scenarios for Brexit.
1. THIN DEAL THIS YEAR
Even if the two sides do clinch a zero-tariff and zero-quota trade deal, it will be thin. 
There will be little scope for closer integration in areas such as services and regulations. Neither would it guarantee continued close ties on many current areas of tight cooperation including on foreign policy, international security and defence.
While far short of the aspirations of both sides following the 2016 Brexit referendum, such a narrow deal is seen as the most economically beneficial option now available. It would keep the bloc's internal market of 450 million consumers open to the world's sixth largest economy, and vice versa.
With a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic ripping through Europe, the bloc hopes to avoid more economic damage. Still, even with a deal, many British exporters expect disruptions at the main borders with the EU in early 2021.
2. TUMULTUOUS NO DEAL
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ultimately decides that a narrow deal is not in his political interest and the United Kingdom leaves without a deal - possibly amid a row.
After Johnson's bid to undercut the 2020 Brexit divorce treaty, there are fears that London is employing what one European diplomat said was Madman Theory - a reference to former U.S. President Richard Nixon's attempt to convince Moscow that he was irrational during the Cold War.
If the negotiators fail to overcome the technical and political differences, Britain and the EU would fall back on World Trade Organization rules, which include trade barriers. 
Johnson says he wants a deal but has repeatedly said that he is ready to leave without a deal - on so-called ""Australian terms"" - if the EU asks for too many concessions. 
The EU does not have a free-trade agreement with Canberra and such an arrangement would give Britain trading terms on par with China but worse than many developing countries like Afghanistan or Mali have with the bloc.
The EU does not believe a no-deal split at the end of the year would exhaust the tortuous Brexit saga and a French diplomat predicted the ensuing chaos in commerce would soon force a return to talks.
The EU also insists it would not enact any new trade deal if Britain goes ahead with plans to undercut their earlier divorce settlement, in particular for the sensitive Irish border.
3. MESSY FUDGE
Amid political grandstanding on both sides, pressure from businesses forces a partial compromise on certain areas at the last minute.
The partial deal - covering some key areas where the sides can find agreement - could be temporarily applied without ratification from EU lawmakers should they run out of time. 
Such a super slim deal, even thinner than predicted under the first scenario, effectively pushes negotiations on the outstanding issues into 2021 and onwards. 
That would give Johnson the sensitive political win of delivering a deal without going back on his promise not to prolong Britain's way out of the EU beyond 2020.
To what extent the sides would then be able to build on such a half-baked treaty would also largely depend on how far London would push its new right to move away from EU standards. 

In particular, the UK would risk erecting a regulatory wall with the EU market if it were to relax its own standards on animal and food safety to win a new U.S. trade agreement, which is crucial to the ""global Britain"" Brexit agenda.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>","Why NASA's moonshot, Boeing, Bezos and Musk have a lot riding on U.S. election","By Joey Roulette and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's differences with rival presidential candidate Joe Biden extend far beyond planet earth. 
President Trump's plans to win the race in space call for a 2024 moon mission, and ending direct U.S. financial support for the International Space Station in 2025 - turning over control of the decades-old orbital laboratory to private space companies.
Biden, on the other hand, would likely call for a delayed moonshot and propose a funding extension for the International Space Station if he wins the White House, according to people familiar with the fledging Biden space agenda.
Pushing back the moon mission could cast more doubt on the long-term fate of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, just as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin scramble to bring rival rockets to market as soon as next year.
Extending support for the space station for a decade would also be a major boost for Boeing, whose $225 million annual ISS operations contract is set to expire in 2024 and is at the depths of a financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding after fatal crashes. 
Boeing and SpaceX are already supplying spacecraft to ferry astronauts to the ISS under a program begun under the Obama administration and supported by both Trump and Biden. 
Though slowing the moonshot would push back contracts for moon landers and related equipment the companies aim to win, the emerging Biden space agenda appears broadly set to promote competition between traditional defense contractors like Boeing and ""new space"" rivals like SpaceX who promise lower-cost and reusable rocket systems and space vehicles.
CRAVING CONSISTENCY
For the commercial space industry, ""consistency is key,"" said Mike French, a vice president at the Aerospace Industries Association trade group who earlier served as NASA chief of staff under Obama.
""If you shake the etch-a-sketch now, you will (be) risking a series of potentially historic accomplishments and the strong and sustained bipartisan support NASA has seen across its portfolio,"" French told Reuters.
Roughly 20 former senior NASA officials and scientists have assembled as a volunteer subgroup under the Biden campaign's science committee to informally help draw up ideas for a space platform.
Many held jobs in the Obama administration and are jockeying for influential roles on the transition team or in a Biden administration.
Reuters spoke to three of those people, as well as over a dozen lobbyists, industry executives, and former NASA officials who have held their own discussions with Biden's campaign.
Members of the subgroup also want to boost NASA funding for Earth science and support partnerships with other nations. They stressed that Biden's space agenda, and the staff assignments to lead it, were in a formative stage as his campaign prioritizes more pressing issues, like the coronavirus pandemic and joblessness.
A Biden campaign spokesman pointed to earlier remarks from Biden. In August, after SpaceX launched and returned the first astronauts from U.S. soil on a trip to the ISS in nearly a decade, Biden said he looked forward to ""leading a bold space program that will continue to send astronaut heroes to expand our exploration and scientific frontiers.""
Representatives for Blue Origin and Boeing declined to comment. SpaceX and the Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
FIGHT OVER BOEING ROCKET
But the Biden space group is divided on what to do about Boeing's SLS, several sources said.
The super heavy-lift rocket has been beset by development delays and cost overruns, but supports tens of thousands of jobs in Alabama and California and is seen by backers as central to NASA's exploration plans and the only path to Trump's 2024 timeline for the Artemis mission.
Critics say the rocket's ageing technology and launch costs of $1 billion or more per mission should prompt a formal White House or Congressional review of the program, particularly if SpaceX and Blue Origin are able to offer new rockets at lower cost.
It costs as little as $90 million to fly Musk's massive but still less-powerful Falcon Heavy, and some $350 million per launch for United Launch Alliance's legacy Delta IV Heavy.
Whether a Biden space policy would be more friendly to SLS or to newer commercial alternatives from ""new space"" players will be heavily influenced by his choice for NASA administrator, a role the campaign wants to be filled by a woman, two people said.
NASA views SLS as its only human-rated ride to the moon in the near term, said Doug Loverro, the former NASA head of human spaceflight. 

""But is that the long-term direction to continue to pursue?"" Loverro asked.

During the Trump administration, South Korea and the United States have been at odds over how much of the cost South Korea should shoulder to accommodate U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
President Donald Trump has said South Korea should pay more and the disagreement raised the prospect that he could push to withdraw at least some U.S. troops, as he has done elsewhere.
""As President, I'll stand with South Korea, strengthening our alliance to safeguard peace in East Asia and beyond, rather than extorting Seoul with reckless threats to remove our troops"", Biden wrote in a piece published on Friday in South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
""I'll engage in principled diplomacy and keep pressing toward a denuclearized North Korea and a unified Korean Peninsula, while working to reunite Korean Americans separated from loved ones in North Korea for decades"", he wrote.
Earlier this month, cost-sharing talks were a major sticking point during an annual security meeting between Defence Minister Suh Wook and U.S. Secretary of Defence Mark Esper.

The U.S. military said this month that it will put nearly 9,000 South Korean workers on unpaid leave from April in the absence of an agreement on the sharing of costs of maintaining 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea.

The government postponed a parliamentary election scheduled for August this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The country's election board, which FANA said had proposed the move, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Next year’s vote will be a litmus test for Abiy, who after decades of repression introduced sweeping economic and political reforms that helped win him the Nobel Prize last year. 
But the new freedoms also fuelled long-suppressed demands for more regional autonomy, rights and resources.
Last month Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region went ahead and held regional elections in a show of defiance against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who called the vote illegal. 
In the past three years, Ethiopia has faced several outbreaks of ethnic violence, what the government described as an attempt at a regional coup led by rogue security forces, and increasingly insistent demands from smaller ethnic groups for their own regions.

France, home to Europe's largest Muslim community, was engaged in a war against Islamist ideology and more militant attacks were likely, interior minister Gerald Damarnin warned.
Protesters marching through the streets of Dhaka, the capital of Muslim-majority Bangladesh, chanted ""Boycott French products"" and carried banners calling Macron ""the world’s biggest terrorist"".
""Macron is leading Islamophobia,"" said demonstrator Akramul Haq. ""He doesn't know the power of Islam. The Muslim world will not let this go in vain. We'll rise and stand in solidarity against him.""
France raised its security alert to the highest level on Thursday after a knife-wielding man shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (God is Greatest) beheaded a woman in a church and killed two more people before being shot and taken away by police.
""We will not give any ground,"" Macron said outside the church in the city of Nice, vowing to deploy thousands more soldiers to guard sites such as places of worship and schools.
France had been attacked ""over our values, for our taste for freedom, for the ability on our soil to have freedom of belief"", he added.
A judicial source in France said a 47-year-old man had been taken into custody on Thursday evening on suspicion of having been in contact with the perpetrator of the attack.
The violence has come at a time of growing Muslim anger over France's defence of the right to publish cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad, and protesters have denounced France in street rallies in several Muslim-majority countries.
Several leaders in Asia expressed support for France after the attacks on Thursday, the birthday of the prophet.
""It is just the most callous and cowardly and vicious act of barbarism by terrorists and should be condemned in the strongest possible way,"" said Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. 
Morrison had expressed his support to Macron, he told media on Friday.
""We share values. We stand for the same things,"" he said.
Morrison also condemned as absurd comments by former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad that Muslims had a right to be angry and kill ""millions of French people for the massacres of the past"".
""Freedom of expression is a right, calling for violence is not,"" the U.S. ambassador to Malaysia, Kamala Shirin Lakhdhir, said on Twitter in response to Mahathir's comments.
Mahathir said his comments were taken out of context, while a senior Malaysian government figure, Abdul Hadi Awang, said Macron's comments could not be justified.
""The French president’s statement exposes his hostility against Islam and its followers,"" said Abdul Hadi, a leader of the Malaysian Islamist party PAS.  
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also voiced support for Macron's position and condemned the violence.
""I strongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks in France,"" Modi said on Twitter on Thursday. ""India stands with France in the fight against terrorism."" 
Thursday's attack came less than two weeks after a middle-school teacher in a Paris suburb was beheaded by an 18-year-old assailant who was apparently incensed that the teacher had shown a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad in class.

France has suffered a string of Islamist militant attacks, from bombings and shootings in 2015 in Paris that killed 130 people to a 2016 attack in Nice that killed 86 when a militant drove a truck through a seafront crowd celebrating Bastille Day.

The driver and passenger of a van were arrested on Wednesday with dynamite, a propane tank torch, a Taser and tools including electric drills, bolt cutters and machetes, Shapiro said in a statement late on Thursday.
""The explosives and tools recovered in the van are commonly used to attempt to dismantle and steal proceeds from ATMs (automated teller machines). There have been at least 30 ATM bombings in Philadelphia in the last four days,"" it said. 
The two suspects appeared to be part of a larger ring of 10-15 vehicles that had set off from a parking lot in a convoy, it said, citing Philadelphia police who were responding to a commercial burglary alarm. 
The convoy fled when police appeared and officers were able to stop only one of the vans with the two suspects inside.
The two were charged with felony possession of weapons of mass destruction, which under Pennsylvania law includes anything with a chemical element or compound that can cause harm or death, as well as conspiracy and risking a catastrophe.
""These individuals who have been charged today tried to use a message of justice to provide cover for their own gain,"" Shapiro said, referring to the street unrest over the police shooting of Walter Wallace.
""We will not allow criminals to hijack, and take advantage of, lawful protests as an opportunity to sow chaos.""
Tension has gripped the streets of Philadelphia since Monday's incident, in which Wallace, 27, armed with a knife, was shot dead by two officers responding to what his relatives say was a call for help with a mental health crisis.

Vietnam, which also shares concern about an increasingly assertive China, was a late addition to the trip that included Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives and Indonesia.
""We look forward to continuing to work together to build on our relationship and to make the region — throughout Southeast Asia, Asia and the Indo-Pacific — safe and peaceful and prosperous,"" said Pompeo, who greeted Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc with an elbow bump before their meeting.
Phuc said he sought ""sincere cooperation"" in support of a peaceful region and progress in trade and investment ties.
While there was no public mention of China on Friday, Pompeo has urged Southeast Asian countries to stand up to its bullying and to reassess business deals with its state firms.
While in Sri Lanka on Wednesday, Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party was operating as a ""predator"". In India the day before, he called for cooperation in confronting what he called Chinese threats to security and freedom in the region.
China has said the United States should stop its unprovoked accusations and attacks.
The main concern in Vietnam is China's claims in the South China Sea.
China's U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" on its maps marks a vast expanse of the sea it claims, including swathes of Vietnam's continental shelf where it has awarded oil concessions and where Chinese and Vietnamese ships have in recent years been embroiled in months-long standoffs.
Pompeo's trip came as Vietnam and the United States mark the 25th anniversary of the normalising of diplomatic ties. But it also came a week after Hanoi released a Vietnamese-born U.S. citizen sentenced to 12 years in jail for ""attempting to overthrow the state"".
Hours before Pompeo's arrival, Vietnam's foreign ministry released a statement saying the man, Michael Nguyen, who returned to his home in California last week, was released for humanitarian reasons. [nL4N2HH1LW]
The statement made no reference to Nguyen's account of his arrest and interrogation, including his claim in a news conference on Wednesday that he had been kidnapped. [nL1N2HK0TU]
Pompeo on Friday met Vietnam's Minister of Public Security To Lam, whose office is in charge of tracking dissidents in the communist-ruled country. 
Bitter enemies during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s, Hanoi and Washington have enjoyed significantly warmer relations in recent years.
But there have some trade tensions of late, with the U.S. Trade Representative confirming in August that it was investigating whether Vietnam had been undervaluing its dong currency and harming U.S. commerce.

Muhyiddin, who has a thin majority in parliament, is facing a challenge for the premiership from opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim and is under pressure to lift an economy battered by the pandemic. 
The premier's credibility also took a hit on Sunday when the king rejected his request to declare emergency rule, seen by critics as an excuse to suspend parliament and avoid a test of his majority. 
The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the largest party in the ruling alliance, has pledged to back Muhyiddin but on Thursday called for a fresh mandate to restore stability. 
""UMNO has decided that the people's mandate should be returned to form a stable government by holding a general election once the COVID-19 pandemic is under control and at its minimum level,"" UMNO president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said in a statement issued after a meeting with party leaders on Thursday night. 
UMNO also vowed to support the government's 2021 budget when it is presented in parliament next week, amid doubts over whether the bill could muster enough votes to pass. 
The budget is the first presented by Muhyiddin's government since it took power in March, and its defeat could trigger an election. 
Last month, UMNO said some party lawmakers supported Anwar's bid to be prime minister. 
Muhyiddin is mulling a cabinet reshuffle to give UMNO officials more prominent roles in government, sources have told Reuters. Some UMNO leaders have baulked at playing second fiddle to the premier's smaller Bersatu party in the ruling alliance, sources have said.

LHASA, China (Reuters) - Dzekyid, a 54-year-old barley farmer, presents himself as a role model for his neighbours and for the success of China's efforts to tie economic development to social control in Tibet.
Dzekyid's well-built house in Jangdam village has a hall filled with Buddhist scriptures and Thangka paintings, and a row of prayer wheels for his religious 76-year-old father, Tenzin, to spin twice a day. As a member of China's ruling Communist Party, Dzekyid is an atheist.
""This house is possible because of good government policies. My heart is wholly with the party, not even one bit with religion,"" said Dzekyid, whose family was showcased to a group of reporters on a government-organised tour of Tibet, an area where access to foreign journalists is normally barred.
Government officials in both Beijing and Tibet vetted the reporters from media organisations who were invited to join the trip. On the closely supervised tour, there was little opportunity to interact with ordinary Tibetans without government officials in attendance.
China is pushing to transform the mindsets and values of Tibetans to bring them into the country's modern mainstream, which includes urging the region's devout Buddhists to focus less on religion and more on material prosperity.
""Tibet has some bad old habits, mainly due to the negative influence of religion that emphasises the afterlife and weakens the urge to pursue happiness in the current life,"" said Che Dhala, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
On the trip to Tibet, officials showcased poverty-relief programmes that include relocation of families to better homes, schooling, vocational training, and business development efforts such as a climate-controlled mushroom farm. The efforts are part of China's push to eradicate rural poverty nationwide by the end of this year.
Officials also described efforts to ""manage the minds"" of Tibetans, who for centuries lived in a deeply religious society with a belief in reincarnation and a devotion to their spiritual leader.
The head of Caiqutang village, Dekyi Paldron, described how poor households who receive free new government housing ""should not"" set up a family room for worshipping Buddha, a common feature in traditional Tibetan houses, because they ""shouldn't be two-faced"" after benefiting from the atheist Communist Party.
""If space is taken up by the Buddha room, the boy and girl may have to squeeze into one bedroom - this is not ideal for the healthy development of either child,"" another official told the visiting journalists.
China seized Tibet after troops entered the region in 1950, in what Beijing calls a ""peaceful liberation."" 
In 1959, spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled China after a failed uprising, and the long-impoverished region has been one of the most politically sensitive and restricted parts of China.
PRAY LESS, WORK MORE
Recipients of poverty relief are told to curb their spending on religion and to instead invest in increasing their earning power and in their children.
At a vocational school in Nyingchi, a signboard stated that the school uses ideological and political education to fight against ""separatism"", denounce the Dalai Lama and to prevent religion from making people ""passive"".
""Ten years ago, villagers competed among themselves to see who donates more to temples. Now they compete to see whose son or daughter has a stable government job, or who owns a car,"" Karma Tenpa, deputy propaganda minister for the Tibet Autonomous Region, told Reuters.
Pictures of the Dalai Lama, once commonly displayed in Tibetans' houses, are banned, but framed posters of President Xi Jinping were visible inside all the homes the journalists were shown. 
Propaganda slogans urging allegiance to China and the Communist Party are conspicuous along roadsides and billboards in Tibet.
Critics say China's efforts linking poverty eradication to an embrace of a secular life and the Communist Party infringe on human rights.
""The Chinese government's efforts to force Tibetans to change their way of life to the one the government approves is a violation of their fundamental human rights, including their freedoms of thought and religion,"" Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch told Reuters.
A recent Reuters report based on official documents described how growing numbers of rural Tibetans were being pushed into recently built training centres, where they are trained to be factory workers in a programme that some critics have called coercive - a characterisation China rejects. 
""At first we have to go around explaining to the nomads and herders why they should go for skills training to earn higher wages. Now that they see the benefit of doing so, they come to us automatically,"" Lin Bei, a poverty alleviation official, told Reuters.
FAME OR SHAME
Families who practise good hygiene or have other desirable attributes receive credits for goods such as washing powder or towels, Lin said. The best are listed as ""Five Star Families"" on the village notice board.
Those deemed to show undesirable behaviour are named and shamed.
""If someone has been lazy, drunk alcohol, hung out at the teahouse or played games instead of taking care of his family, we will call him out at the village meeting,"" said Lin, who is a member of China's ethnic Han majority.
Dzekyid, who like many Tibetans uses only one name, encourages his neighbours to support the party and its programmes. His house was built with a government grant of nearly $20,000.

""Praying to the gods and Buddha can't get me this,"" he told Reuters.

(Reuters) - New Zealand has provisionally voted to legalise euthanasia but is on course to reject law changes that would allow recreational marijuana use, the country's Electoral Commission said on Friday. 
New Zealand voted on the two referendums this month while casting ballots during a general election that returned Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to power.
Issuing preliminary results, the commission said there are nearly half a million mostly overseas-based special votes still to be counted. These votes will not be enough to alter the vote on euthanasia but may be enough to swing the count on recreational marijuana, it said.
Full results will be published on Nov. 6, but with more than 65.2% of voters in favour of the recently passed legislation permitting euthanasia, New Zealand will become the seventh country to allow assisted suicide.
The law - which allows terminal patients with less than six months to live to request assisted suicide - will come into effect in November 2021.
Those requesting euthanasia will have to be 18 and will need the approval of two doctors.
While euthanasia has been endorsed, recreational marijuana use is still up in the air.
New Zealand's Electoral Commission said 53.1% of voters opposed the country becoming only the third to legalise the adult use and sale of cannabis, following Canada and Uruguay.
In 2017, Ardern supported the cannabis referendum plan in order to secure enough support to form a coalition government.

Ardern throughout the campaign refused to say which way she would vote, but a representative on Friday said the prime minister voted in support of both referendums.

1486,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 09:18PM ET</span>",Corbyn’s Suspension Threatens to Re-Ignite U.K. Labour Civil War,"(Bloomberg) -- Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension from the U.K. Labour Party he led until April threatened to re-open divisions in the party after six months of relative calm under new leader Keir Starmer.
The U.K.’s main opposition took action against Corbyn on Thursday after he failed to accept in full the findings of an anti-Semitism probe by the Equality and Human Rights Commission that found the party broke the law on his watch.
Corbyn said on Twitter that he will “contest the political intervention to suspend me.” He was backed by the Socialist Campaign Group, a group of more than 30 Labour Members of Parliament -- accounting for about a sixth of the parliamentary party -- who pledged to “work tirelessly” for his reinstatement.
Corbyn’s suspension is “an act of grave injustice which, if not reversed, will create chaos within the party and in doing so compromise Labour’s chances of a general election victory,” Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite the Union, the party’s biggest affiliate and a major donor, said in a statement. “A split party will be doomed to defeat.”
It’s a moment of danger for Starmer, who has pledged to make Labour electable again after it sank to its fourth successive election defeat in December, and its worst since 1935. Corbyn’s five years in charge were beset with division -- as well as allegations of anti-Semitism. The longtime socialist enjoyed grassroots support but had a fractious relationship with his own MPs, who tried to wrest back control of the party.
But a snap YouGov poll on Thursday showed 58% of Britons think suspending Corbyn was the right decision, compared to 13% who thought it was the wrong one. Of people who voted for the Corbyn-led party in last year’s election, 41% supported his suspension, versus 26% who opposed it.
Labour luminaries also lined up to praise the move. Former acting Labour leader Harriet Harman called Corbyn’s suspension “the right thing to do,” while Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who went public with her concerns over anti-Semitism within the party, welcomed the move.
‘Enough Is Enough’
“Labour is finally saying enough is enough, anti-Semitism can never be tolerated in our party,” Hodge said on Twitter. “Now we can finally move on.”
Since taking control of the party, Starmer has focused on rebuilding relations with the Jewish community as he tries to turn Labour into a legitimate government-in-waiting. Though fraught with risk, the suspension will further distance Starmer from the previous leadership -- though Boris Johnson’s Conservatives kept up their attacks on him as “Corbyn’s man” on Thursday.
Accusations of anti-Semitism severely hampered Labour’s bid for power under Corbyn, and the commission said in its report the party under his watch breached the Equality Act through its handling of complaints of anti-Jewish prejudice. It said there were “serious failings in leadership” and “political interference” in the handling of anti-Semitism complaints.
It also found two instances of unlawful conduct relating to the use of anti-Semitic tropes -- using written or verbal phrases or images to suggest stereotypes -- and to suggestions that complaints were “smears” and “fake.”
‘Dramatically Overstated’
In response to the report, Corbyn said he did “not accept all of its findings” and that the problem was “dramatically overstated for political reasons” by the media and his opponents.
“One anti-Semite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media,” he said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
That stance forced Labour to act, blaming both Corbyn’s comments and “his failure to retract them subsequently.” The suspension means the former leader will also no longer represent Labour in the House of Commons.
“I made it clear that we won’t tolerate anti-Semitism or the denial of anti-Semitism through the suggestion that it’s exaggerated or factional,” Starmer said after his predecessor’s suspension was announced. “That’s why I‘m disappointed with Jeremy Corbyn’s response, and that is why appropriate action has been taken which I fully support.”
‘Day of Shame’
Earlier Thursday, Starmer had called the report a “day of shame” for Labour, and apologized for the “pain and grief” caused to Jewish people. He pledged to implement the report’s recommendations in full and provide an action plan to the commission within six weeks.
He also issued the warning that gained significance with subsequent events: “Those who deny there’s a problem are part of the problem.”
The challenge for Starmer now is how to re-unite the party as Corbyn loyalists rally round their former leader, including his former finance spokesman, John McDonnell, and his former home affairs spokeswoman, Diane Abbott.
“On the day we should all be moving forward and taking all steps to fight anti-Semitism, the suspension of Jeremy Corbyn is profoundly wrong,” McDonnell said on Twitter. “In interests of party unity let’s find a way of undoing and resolving this.”

1487,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 09:15PM ET</span>",Profile of Aung San Suu Kyi ahead of Myanmar's election,"(Reuters) - Aung San Suu Kyi leads her National League for Democracy (NLD) party to the polls on Nov. 8 in Myanmar's second general election since the end of full military rule in 2011.
Here are some facts about the 75-year-old who rode to power after a 2015 landslide election win that established the Southeast Asian nation's first civilian government in half a century.
- The daughter of independence hero Aung San, who was assassinated when she was two years old, Suu Kyi spent much of her youth overseas. At Oxford University, she met British academic Michael Aris, who would become her husband. They had two sons and settled in Oxford.
- In 1988, Suu Kyi returned to Yangon, then the capital, to care for her dying mother. There, she was swept up in student-led protests against the military, which had ruled since a 1962 coup.
- An eloquent public speaker, Suu Kyi was a likely candidate to lead the movement but the protests were crushed, its leaders killed and jailed, and she was soon imprisoned in her lakeside family home, where she remained until 2010, despite brief releases from house arrest. 
- Suu Kyi made a decision to remain in Myanmar to lead a campaign for democracy. Although the military made it clear she could leave, she feared she would not be allowed to return.
- She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, which her elder son Alexander collected on her behalf.
- In August 2011, Suu Kyi had her first meeting with then President Thein Sein, a former general and head of the quasi-civilian administration, marking the start of a pragmatic period of engagement with a government of ex-soldiers.
- In 2015, she came to power on a platform of ending civil war, drumming up foreign investment, and reducing the army's role in politics. Suu Kyi also promised Western allies that she would address the plight of the Rohingya Muslim people, forming an advisory commission headed by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
- A day after Annan's report was released in August 2017, advising sweeping changes, Rohingya militants attacked security forces in Rakhine State. The military responded with a campaign that included the torching of hundreds of villages and killings, and was described by the U.N. human rights high commissioner as ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".
Suu Kyi blamed ""terrorists"" for an ""iceberg of misinformation"" about the crisis and said the military was exercising the ""rule of law"". In a September address to the nation, she appeared baffled about the exodus, saying in reference to refugees: ""We want to know why they are leaving"". 
- She went to the Hague last year to face charges of genocide brought against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice at The Hague. She acknowledged the possibility war crimes had been committed but framed the crackdown as a legitimate military operation against terrorists.

- In 2020, a survey by election watchdog the People's Alliance for Credible Elections, found that 79% of people had trust in Suu Kyi - still beloved as ""the Lady"" - up from 70% the year before.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan may effectively shut off China from supplying drones to its government to protect sensitive information, according to six people in government and the ruling party familiar with the matter, as part of a broad effort to bolster national security. 
The primary concerns, those people said, centred on information technology, supply chains, cyber security and intellectual property - worries that have been rising outside Japan as well. 
But Japan must balance such fears - particularly Beijing's growing push to export sensitive technologies such as commercial drones and security cameras - against deep economic dependence on China. 
It must also navigate increasingly choppy waters between China and Japan's closest ally, the United States, which is at odds with Beijing over many things, including technology.
""China is a big market and it is important for Japan,"" one of the senior government officials said. ""On the other hand, there are worries that advanced technologies and information could leak to China and could be diverted for military use.""
The defence ministry has several hundred drones, including some made by Chinese companies; the coast guard has about 30, and most are Chinese. Both said they were not using Chinese drones for security-related issues. Other government entities also use such drones. 
It's unclear whether all would need to be replaced, but the new drones, used for sensitive work such as criminal investigation, infrastructure work and emergency rescues, would have to be secured against data leaks and go through stricter vetting procedures, the revamped policy says. 
The tightened rules, set to come into effect in April 2021, don't mention any country by name. But the senior government and ruling party sources told Reuters they were created with China in mind.
The initiative includes fresh investment rules for foreigners enacted last year; ruling party lawmakers are also preparing a proposal on an all-encompassing law to promote economic security that will be unveiled this year. 
Separately, Japan's National Security Council set up a unit in April to examine how economic matters, such as advanced technologies, could affect national security. 
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Domestic drone makers expect to benefit from the changes, as they mean government ministries will most likely do their drone shopping at home.
A Japanese drone manufacturer, Tokyo Aircraft Instrument Co., Ltd., developed a camera drone that can fly in high winds - making it ideal for surveying damage after a disaster - and the company is talking potential applications with the government. 
""The drone platform, flight-control system and radio communication equipment are all domestic-made, and it is our unique model based on our years of experience in avionics components,"" said Kazuya Sumida of the company's drone division. ""We plan to further enhance the security of the drone's information and communications functions."" 
To be sure, government sales make up a small part of the nation's drone business market, which stood at 140.9 billion yen ($1.35 billion) in the fiscal year to March 2020, up 51% from the previous year, according to Impress Research institute. The market is expected to grow to 642.7 billion yen in the fiscal year to March 2026.
But the aim isn't to boost local drone makers, the measure's backers say - it's to keep Japan secure. 
""Japan will keep diplomatic ties with China but we will be more carefully respond to sensitive technologies and information,"" said another senior government official.
Analysts say the U.S. can't fully cut off China either because it would hurt the U.S. economy.
""I think allied nations will discuss critical technologies, especially information and technologies which could give military advantage to China,"" said Tsuneo Watanabe, senior fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation. 
Japan has already set aside around 300 billion yen to diversify its supply chains and reduce reliance on China by bringing production home or locating more in Southeast Asia.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said the shooting death of a South Korean man in its waters last month was a self-defensive measure amid concerns about the spread of the novel coronavirus, state media reported on Friday. 
North Korean troops shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who went missing in late September, before dousing his body in oil and setting it on fire, South Korea's military have said.
Seoul has called for a joint investigation after the North said it burned a floatation device he was using, not his body, amid public and political outrage. 
The North's official KCNA news agency accused South Korean opposition lawmakers of stoking controversy over the issue, blaming Seoul for failing to stop him from crossing the maritime border into the North. 
""Our soldier could not but take self-defensive measure as he judged that the south Korean citizen who had made an illegal intrusion into the waters ... under the control of our side was about to flee, not responding to interception,"" KCNA said. 
The incident was ""the result of improper control of the citizen by the south side in the sensitive hotspot at a time when there are tension and danger due to the vicious virus sweeping the whole of South Korea,"" it added. 
""Therefore, the blame for the incident first rests with the south side."" 
South Korea's military has said the man was attempting to defect to the North when he was reported missing from a fisheries boat just south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), a disputed demarcation of military control that acts as the de facto maritime boundary between the two Koreas.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare apology for the killing days after the incident, saying it was to prevent any coronavirus outbreak.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian federal prosecutors on Thursday filed a lawsuit contesting a compensation package for victims from a 2015 collapsed dam jointly owned by mining giants BHP and Vale, arguing that the package is far too low.
The move comes after prosecutors earlier this month accused the two companies of colluding with a lawyer to reduce compensation for the victims and interfere with a landmark lawsuit against BHP in the UK.
At a news conference on Thursday, the federal prosecutors said the package being offered was far too low given the scale of the tragedy. It would also force the victims to waive rights in other indemnity proceedings, such as the $6.3 billion British lawsuit. 
BHP, the target of the UK suit, brought by 200,000 Brazilian people and groups, has called it ""pointless and wasteful."" 
In the 2015 incident, a mining waste dam burst at BHP and Vale's Samarco joint venture in the town of Mariana, releasing a torrent of sludge that killed 19 people. The collapse is also considered the country's worst-ever environmental disaster, contaminating a river for hundreds of miles to the ocean.
The prosecutors' appeal is the latest in a series of ongoing lawsuits against Vale and BHP over the disaster, which have caused the companies to set aside multi-billion-dollar provisions.
The Renova Foundation, which the companies set up to manage compensation, said that until last month, 10.1 billion reais ($1.80 billion) had been allocated to environmental recovery and compensation. As of Aug. 31, it said, about 2.6 billion reais had been paid in damages and emergency financial aid to approximately 321,000 people. 
Vale said on Thursday it was committed to supporting the Renova Foundation's efforts, adding that programs to repair damages had already received more than 10 billion reais.
BHP did not immediately respond.

And thus the World Peace and Unification Sanctuary Church, or just Sanctuary Church, founded by two men who broke away from their father Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, offers its contribution to U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign.
In Greeley, Pennsylvania, some 100 miles (160 km) north of Philadelphia, parishioners - joined by hundreds of visitors from Japan and South Korea - are on a 21-day spiritual retreat to help re-elect Trump, whom co-founder Hyung Jin Moon said represents ""the Biblical world view.""
Trump, a Republican, draws strong support from white evangelical Christian voters, some 78% of whom back him, according to the Pew Research Center. That is largely linked to his recent vocal opposition to abortion and his support of social conservatives.
His support is less overwhelming among white non-evangelical Protestants and white Roman Catholics, and he trails by wide margins among Jewish, Hispanic Catholic and Black Protestant voters. https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/13/white-christians-continue-to-favor-trump-over-biden-but-support-has-slipped
Biden often talks about his Catholic faith, while Trump has discussed religious liberty but rarely discusses religion in personal terms.
The Sanctuary Church has made headlines for its outspoken gun advocacy, and its encouragement of church members to bring firearms to services. Hyung Jin Moon now tells his followers that this year's election represents a choice between ""good or evil.""

""Whether it be going to a Trump rally, or whether it be just going to a certain, a holy place to pray, or whether it be going on the street and waving flags... what we are mostly focusing on is the spiritual nature of the battle and a fervent prayer,"" said Moon.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected another bid by North Carolina Republicans to block the extension of a deadline for receiving mail-in ballots for next Tuesday's election. 
In a brief order, the justices denied a request by Republican lawmakers in the state to put on hold an agreement made by state election officials allowing the extension that a North Carolina state court had approved. The justices on Wednesday rebuffed a separate bid by President Donald Trump's re-election campaign to block the deadline extension through federal courts. 
Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted the Republican request to block the ballot deadline extension. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court on Tuesday as Trump's third appointee, did not participate in the case. Barrett did not have time to fully review the case filings, a court spokeswoman said in a statement.
The state election board, citing potential U.S. Postal Service mail delivery delays, had opted to allow absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrived up to nine days later.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Americans born in Jerusalem will now be able to list Israel as their birthplace on their passports, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Thursday, in a nod to Washington's recognition of the contested city as Israel's capital.
It was the latest in a string of pro-Israel policy shifts by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration ahead of his re-election bid next week. 
Five years ago, when former President Barack Obama was in the White House, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law that would have let Jerusalem-born Americans list Israel on their passports as their country of birth, saying it unlawfully encroached on presidential powers to set foreign policy.
The status of Jerusalem, a city holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians, is among the tensions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 2017, Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy and recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Most countries do not.
Pompeo said the decision to allow Jerusalem-born U.S. citizens to choose to enter Israel or Jerusalem as their birthplace was ""consistent"" with Trump's 2017 proclamation.
The Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as capital of the future state they seek in the West Bank and Gaza, cried foul.
Trump ""is trying to write off Palestinian rights,"" Wasel Abu Youssef of the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation told Reuters, accusing the U.S. president of trying to ""encourage Evangelists and Jewish Americans to step up voting for him.""
On Wednesday, the Trump administration lifted a ban on U.S. taxpayer funding for scientific research conducted by Israel in its West Bank settlements.
Trump envoys have also helped establish ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan - countries that had formally shunned the country in solidarity with the Palestinians.

""It has become clear that Carreno is in charge of distributing the money that funds the groups that are trying to submerge Venezuela in conflict,"" Saab said in a state television address. 
Carreno heard the charges during a court appearance on Wednesday, his lawyer wrote on Twitter.
Guaido has dismissed Carreno's arrest as an act of political persecution by President Nicolas Maduro's government. The U.S. National Security Council, a key ally of Venezuela's opposition, said on Twitter on Thursday that the arrest was evidence of ""the Maduro regime's corruption and brutality."" 

The arrest came after Popular Will leader Leopoldo Lopez fled the Spanish ambassador's residence in Caracas, where he had been living as a guest since escaping house arrest in April 2019. Lopez arrived in Madrid on Sunday.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",Nice attack points to continued Tunisian struggle with jihadists,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Though French police believe the attacker who killed three people in Nice on Thursday is a Tunisian, the North African democracy has made big strides in tackling the jihadist threat in recent years. 
A French police source told Reuters the man who beheaded an elderly woman and killed two others in a church in the French Riviera city was thought to be a 21-year-old Tunisian who recently entered France via Italy.
Five years after militant Islamists killed scores of tourists in two mass shootings in Tunisia, police in the North African state have grown far better at disrupting plots and responding quickly when attacks take place, diplomats say. 
However, a steady series of smaller attacks has shown that the threat remains. 
Tunisians made up one of the largest contingents of foreign fighters for Islamic State, and though many died in wars in Syria and Iraq, some returned home and were imprisoned. 
An al Qaeda group is meanwhile entrenched in a hilly, inaccessible part of the border region between Tunisia and Algeria but has proven unable to stage attacks beyond that area. 
The last major attack in Nice was also carried out by a Tunisian man who had emigrated to France in 2005 before driving a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in 2016, killing 86 people.
Tunisia's Foreign Ministry condemned the latest Nice attack and a branch of the judiciary said it has opened an investigation into the suspect.
Though the 2011 revolution brought Tunisia democracy and freedom of expression, it did not translate into an improvement in living standards or economic opportunity, and ever more young people have sought to emigrate.
In September, Italy said the number of migrants arriving over the past year in boats across the Mediterranean - often to the small island of Lampedusa - had risen by half thanks in part to Tunisia's economic woes.
Lampedusa is only 130 km (80 miles) from the Tunisian coast and young Tunisians living in port towns have told Reuters of a constant temptation to board the ever-present boats departing at night and seek their fortunes in prosperous Europe.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Labour opposition suspended its former leader Jeremy Corbyn on Thursday after he downplayed a report that detailed serious failings in the party's handling of persistent anti-Semitism complaints during his 2015-2019 leadership.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said it had found evidence of political interference in the processing of anti-Semitism complaints, failure to provide adequate training to people handling the complaints, and harassment.
""The ... analysis points to a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent anti-Semitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it,"" the EHRC said.
Corbyn's successor, Keir Starmer, said he accepted the findings in full and would implement all the recommended reforms.
""It is a day of shame for the Labour Party. We have failed Jewish people... I am truly sorry for all the pain and grief that has been caused,"" he said. ""Never again will we fail to tackle anti-Semitism and never again will we lose your trust.""
Starmer has been trying to mark a clean break from the Corbyn era on the anti-Semitism issue, but the ruling Conservatives were quick to point out that he had held a senior post as Labour Brexit policy chief under Corbyn.
Corbyn, 71, said he did not accept all the EHRC findings, that the scale of the problem had been overstated by the media and by his political opponents, and that his attempts to deal with the issue had been blocked by ""obstructive party bureaucracy"".
After his comments, Labour suspended him.
""In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation,"" it said in a statement.
""SHAMELESS""
Corbyn said he would strongly contest his suspension, calling it a political intervention.
""I’ve made absolutely clear that those who deny there has been an anti-Semitism problem in the Labour Party are wrong,"" he said following his suspension.
""It’s also undeniable that a false impression has been created of the number of members accused of anti-Semitism... that is what has been overstated, not the seriousness of the problem.""
The Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomed the suspension.
""Having presided over the descent of a proudly anti-racist party into a party that broke equalities law in its treatment of Jews, his shameless comments today showed that he remains part of the problem and is an obstruction to the resolution of the issue,"" President Marie van der Zyl said.
A veteran campaigner for Palestinian rights who spent decades as an obscure lawmaker on the left-wing fringes of the party, Corbyn shocked the establishment by winning the Labour leadership contest in 2015.
But critics, including some Jewish Labour lawmakers and members, said his ascent led to a surge of anti-Semitic comments within the party, with the lines between opposition to Israel and anti-Jewish prejudice becoming blurred.
The issue dogged Corbyn throughout his leadership despite his insistence that he opposed all forms of racism including anti-Semitism. Jewish leaders repeatedly condemned his statements as weak and tone-deaf.

Corbyn resigned after Labour suffered a heavy defeat by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives in last year's December general election, with Starmer taking over earlier this year.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday granted a last-minute request to stop the U.S. government from turning over to Japan two Massachusetts men to face charges that they helped smuggle former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) Chairman Carlos Ghosn out of the country while he was awaiting trial on financial crimes.
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston granted a request by lawyers for U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, to delay the transfer shortly before the two men were scheduled to be placed on a flight to Japan.
Their lawyers sought the delay after the State Department approved handing over the men, who in September lost a court challenge to their potential extradition. They were arrested in May at the request of Japanese authorities.
Taylors' lawyers and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment.
Prosecutors say the Taylors facilitated a ""brazen"" escape in which Ghosn fled Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching Lebanon, his childhood home, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.
The State Department notified the Taylors' lawyers of its decision on Wednesday. 

U.S. Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, a Republican who has taken interest in the case, wrote on Twitter that he was ""outraged"" by the State Department's decision to extradite the two men. ""This former Special Forces member and his son will not be treated fairly,"" he said.

ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - COVID-19 cases are accelerating in some parts of Africa and governments should step up preparations for a second wave, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.
Over the past four week, cases have increased by 45% per week on average in Kenya, by 19% in Democratic Republic of Congo and by 8% in Egypt, the African Union-run organisation's head John Nkengasong said. 
""The time to prepare for a second wave is truly now,"" he said, urging governments ""not to get into prevention fatigue mode."" 
The continent of 1.3 billion people has so far managed better than widely expected in terms of containing the epidemic, with a lower percentage of deaths than other regions, partly due to strict lockdown measures imposed in March. 
There have been 41,776 deaths among the 1.74 million people reported infected with the virus, according to a Reuters tally based on official data as of Thursday morning.
Beginning in August, many governments eased restrictions, however, and a trend of decreasing cases has flattened, Matshidiso Moeti, Africa director for the WHO said in an online press conference on Thursday.
In Kenya, the government allowed bars to reopen on Sept. 28 and cut the nightly curfew by two hours. Schools partially reopened on Oct. 12. 
Some easing was justified to help economies in the region to start recovering, Moeti said. 
However, ""we will need to be dealing with some of these upticks. What is important is to contain them."" 

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday announced a Nov 4 summit to review the surge in infections, and urged Kenyans to wear face masks properly and practice social distancing to avoid ""losing hard-fought for ground"" in the fight against the disease.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House notified Congress it intends to sell 50 5-35 fighter jets made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) to the United Arab Emirates, setting up a potential showdown with the U.S. legislature, which could vote to block the sales, sources said on Thursday. 
The United States and the UAE aim to have a letter of agreement for the F-35 jets in time for UAE National Day celebrated on Dec. 2, Reuters reported in September.
The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees, whose members have criticized the UAE's role in civilian deaths in Yemen, have the right to review, and block, weapons sales under an informal review process.
Israel initially balked at the prospective sale but last year dropped its opposition after what it described as U.S. guarantees that Israeli military superiority would be preserved.
""We all face a common threat,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an apparent allusion to Iran, told reporters on Thursday when asked about the Reuters report.

""But with that said, it was important that the (Israeli) defense establishment received this clear American undertaking to preserve our qualitative military edge,"" added Netanyahu, who earlier on Thursday hosted visiting Pentagon chief Mark Esper.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany's state leaders agreed on Wednesday to an emergency month-long lockdown that includes closing restaurants, gyms and theatres to reverse a spike in coronavirus cases that risks overwhelming hospitals.
""Running checks will be crucial to ensure the success of the new measures,"" Seehofer said. ""In coordination with the states, federal police will deploy thousands of officers.""
Heightened checks could be unpopular in a country wary of state surveillance after the experience of Communist East Germany and Hitler's Nazis.
The western city of Essen has provoked criticism from opposition politicians for trying to recruit residents to report other citizens who do not comply with coronavirus restrictions, a method seen by some as a reminder of the Nazi past.
On its homepage, Essen provides an online form for people to fill in their complaints over violations of the rules, including the possibility to upload pictures.
Seehofer said federal police would first be used in big cities and areas most severely hit by the pandemic.
Officers would also run increased checks at airports, railway stations and close to the borders to ensure people entering the country from high-risk regions observe the rules.
In Germany, responsibility for the police mainly lies with the 16 states. The roughly 40,000 officers of the federal police are in charge of border security, but can also support state police if necessary.

Even before the new measures were announced, the capital Berlin had enlisted the help of 500 federal police officers to tackle illegal parties and gatherings that local police failed to bring under control.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo warned on Thursday the West African nation faced a catastrophe if candidates in Saturday's presidential election do not resolve a standoff that has led to violent protests and an opposition call for boycott.
Unidentified assailants torched several vehicles and assaulted residents in the commercial capital Abidjan late on Wednesday, police said, underscoring the tense atmosphere in a race marred by sometimes deadly clashes over President Alassane Ouattara's bid for a third term.
On the last day of campaigning ahead of the vote, Gbagbo said he felt compelled to give his first interview since being arrested in 2011 for his role in a civil war sparked by his refusal to concede defeat to Ouattara in the previous year's election. 
The International Criminal Court acquitted him last year of war crimes charges related to the conflict, in which 3,000 people were killed. 
""What we're headed towards is catastrophe, that's why I’m talking,"" he told French television network TV5Monde.
Sporadic violence has killed around 30 people since August, when Ouattara announced his candidacy, a move the opposition says violates the constitution. His two main challengers - former president Henri Konan Bedie and former prime minister Affi N'Guessan - have called on supporters to prevent the vote from taking place.
The events have stoked fears about a slide into violence and consequent economic fallout in the world's top cocoa producer. 
Gbagbo, who has not been granted a passport to return home from Europe and whose candidacy in the current race was barred by the authorities, said he agreed with the opposition's stance on term limits, but urged all sides to talk.
""The people should sit down and talk,"" he said. ""The quarrel is taking us towards the abyss.""
Ouattara says the government is deploying 35,000 security force members on election day to make sure voting is peaceful. 

In Abidjan's Yopoupon district, a stronghold of Gbagbo supporters, the blackened shell of a bus lay on a road scorched the previous night. ""Given everything that's going on, we're worried,"" said 43-year-old resident Fernand Labouke.

The 27 were killed ""due to conflicts along the borders of Somali and Afar"", the statement said. Militias from the two eastern states have clashed before over their disputed boundaries. 
Ali Bedel, a spokesman for the Somali region, confirmed the killings and blamed militants in Afar.
""Local militia from Afar were behind the killings,"" he told Reuters. 
A spokesman for the Afar region did not respond to a Reuters call for comment. 
In 2014, the federal government redrew the boundary between the two states and transferred three small towns to Afar that Somali has since wanted back.
""The transfer of three Somali towns...to Afar regional administration in 2014 without any legal procedure lies at the heart of these recurring tragic and senseless killings,"" Mohamed Olad, a political analyst based in Addis Ababa, told Reuters.
Deadly intermittent unrest has rocked Ethiopia since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. 
Africa's second most populous nation, Ethiopia is one of the continent's fastest growing economies and is due to hold elections next year.
But decades of frustration over government repression and a series of democratic reforms by Abiy have emboldened regional power-brokers keen to challenge the ruling party.
Long-suppressed frustrations frequently explode into ethnic violence.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will be under a state of emergency until early May, giving regions legal backing to decide curfews and restrict travel to try and contain rampant COVID-19 contagion.
Spain is one of Europe's worst COVID-19 hot spots, with over 3 million infections.
Its response to the pandemic has often been hampered by political wrangling, but the government this time managed to gather enough votes for parliament to back extending an initial two-week decree until May 9.
Some worried about the consequences, though, in a country that is already suffering through its worst recession since the late 1930s civil war.
""It seems too much to me, people can't stand it,"" said Madrid resident Angela Suarez, a chef who has already had her working hours reduced because of the crisis.
""We don't know what to do. And we pay rent, bills, we're thinking, what, what, what to do?""
The government said the state of emergency, and the restrictions on mobility it comes with across Spain, were unavoidable.
""We are aware that citizens are tired after months of effort and sacrifices, of not being able to do what they used to do before, to hug people, our family and friends,"" Health Minister Salvador Illa told parliament.
""But it is not the time to relax measures, we have, very tough weeks and months ahead of us.""
That will however not be the end of uncertainty for many Spaniards, as the government is leaving it to each region to decide its own measures, creating a patchwork of restrictions across the country.
While Madrid just wants to ban travel in and out of its territory for bank holiday weekends, Catalonia on Thursday joined a growing number of regions banning entering and exiting their territory for at least 15 days. 
Catalan officials said the new measures, which also include closing cinemas and theatres and extending a shutdown of bars and restaurants, were necessary to make sure hospitals can cope. 
""Our health system cannot deal with this level of stress. It can't take much more,"" Catalan health chief Alba Verges said. 
During weekends, Catalonia residents will also be banned from leaving their municipality.
With Christmas on the horizon, some in Madrid worried they will not be able to be with their loved ones.

""Well, for me (the holidays) are going to be very sad, I have children living in the United States and they cannot come,"" said Pilar, a pensioner.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a staunch ally of President Vladimir Putin, threw a champagne party in Russia's parliament in 2016 to toast Donald Trump's presidential election victory. 
But this weekend, the veteran lawmaker says his youth activists will be outside the U.S. embassy in Moscow chanting ""Take Biden and Trump Down!"" ahead of Tuesday's election.
""He (Trump) has done nothing good for us,"" Zhirinovsky, head of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, told Reuters.
""But we're acting according to the Russian saying that you choose the lesser of two evils. Biden is too great an evil."" 
Zhirinovsky often indulges in clownish showmanship and firebrand nationalist rhetoric. But the 74-year-old veteran lawmaker's comments are also seen as sometimes capturing the zeitgeist in the Kremlin - which concerning the U.S. election appears to be a tepid preference for Trump.
The Russian lower house of parliament greeted Trump's 2016 win with applause, relishing his praise of Putin and stated desire for better ties.
Four years on, that euphoria has evaporated.
To be sure, the polarisation that Trump spurred in U.S. politics was welcomed by some parts of the Russian political elite.
""While they've been fighting among themselves, they (the Americans) have been too busy to fully pay attention to us, and that's how we like it,"" said one Russian official, who declined to be named. ""We don't like it when others poke their noses into our affairs"". 
But the Kremlin's hopes of better U.S.-Russia ties never materialised. 
Instead, Washington hit Russia with a slew of sanctions over alleged U.S. election meddling and other actions, tried to stymie its showcase Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, and pulled out of a key nuclear arms treaty. 
""Under Trump, basically all the pillars of the relationship were destroyed,"" said Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think tank close to the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
""We had a diplomatic war, both embassies became like besieged fortresses. And diplomacy in a sense was replaced by sanctions,"" said Kortunov, referring to a wave of diplomatic expulsions over the poisoning of a Russian double agent in Britain in 2018.
BIDEN'S TOUGH STANCE
The Kremlin has said Russia will work with any U.S. leader and recent statements from Putin on the issue suggest he is hedging his bets, praising and criticising both Trump and Biden. [nL1N2HG0LV] 
Privately, Russian government officials say they have zero hopes of better ties if Trump wins, as they expect his room for manoeuvre to continue to be severely limited by Congress and U.S. domestic politics.
They see Biden as tougher on Russia, but less unpredictable than Trump to deal with and perhaps more open to doing deals on nuclear arms control. 
The election has weighed on the rouble for months, with investors associating a Biden victory with greater risk of more sanctions. [nL8N2GY5HG]
The official rhetoric, from Zhirinovsky and others, suggests however that Trump remains Moscow's favoured candidate, even if past enthusiasm for him has faded.
The Kremlin has accused Biden of stoking hatred of Russia by naming it as the biggest threat to U.S. national security. [nL8N2HH2ES]
While the 2018 summit in Helsinki showed Putin and Trump appeared to get on well at a personal level, there are no such hopes for a Putin-Biden relationship. 

""Clearly these two personalities are not great admirers of one another,"" said Kortunov.

PARIS/NICE (Reuters) - As he did every day, the sexton of the Notre Dame church in the French city of Nice opened up the doors around 08:30 am. There were few people around; the first Mass of the day was not due to start for another two hours.
But by around 09:00 am, a man armed with a knife entered the church and slit the throat of the sexton, partially beheaded an elderly woman, and badly wounded a third woman, according to a police source.
The sexton and the elderly woman died on the spot, the third woman managed to make it out of the church into a nearby cafe, but she died from her wounds, Nice mayor Christian Estrosi told reporters at the scene. None of the victims has so far been named.
What happened in the initial moments of the attack inside the church, a neo-Gothic building in a tree-lined square in the centre of Nice, remains unclear.
But testimony from witnesses, mobile phone footage, and accounts from officials, offer an initial if incomplete picture of how the attack ended. 
At some point during the attack inside the church, someone ran to a bakery next to the church, and asked staff to call the police.
""I thought it was a joke, I didn't believe it,"" said one of the staff in the bakery, who spoke to French broadcaster BFMTV and gave his name as David.
But when the person insisted the police should be called, David said he walked the short distance to the corner of Rue d'Italie and Avenue Jean Medecin, where last year local authorities installed an intercom in front of the church that connects directly to the municipal police.
David said he pressed the button on the intercom, and summoned the police. The mayor, Estrosi, who had attended last year's unveiling of the intercom, said this was how police were first alerted to the attack. 
David said the police arrived on the scene within 30 seconds, while he went back inside his bakery and pulled down the blinds. The police arrived at 09:10 am, according to a police spokesman, 10 minutes after the attack began.
BLOOD AND PANIC 
At some point during the attack, the knifeman came out of the church, according to Didier-Olivier Reverdy of police officer's union Alliance Police Nationale. 
""When the attacker came out, there was a kind of panic around the concourse"" surrounding the church, said Reverdy. ""There was blood visible."" 
Anais Colomna was in the lawyer's office where she works, next to the church, when her phone call was interrupted by the sound of gunfire.
""When I turned around, I saw that they (the police) were firing at someone who was moving away from the church,"" she told Reuters. The man police were firing at then disappeared from view, she said. 
What happened next is unclear, but it appeared the attacker went back inside the church. 
In video footage obtained by Reuters, shot from a balcony across the street from the church, police officers with guns and Tasers raised, could be seen in the side entrance of the church, looking inside. Gunshots could be heard. It was not clear from the footage what they were shooting at.
Estrosi said that, as police were detaining the attacker, ""he kept shouting on a loop, 'Allahu Akbar'."" The Arabic phrase means God is Greatest. The attacker carried on shouting the phrase even after he was shot and wounded by police, Estrosi said. 
Footage from the same balcony vantage point later showed a man with dark hair on an ambulance gurney being wheeled out of the side entrance of the church and into a waiting ambulance. Police with guns surrounded the man on the stretcher, who was motionless.
A witness who observed the scene said the man on the gurney was the knife attacker, but Reuters was unable to independently verify that.
Outside the church a short while later, parishioners gathered to seek news about the victims.
Michele Malé, one of the parishioners, broke down in tears. ""We just found out on TV that our sexton was assassinated,"" she told reporters. ""We're in shock.""
The sexton -- a lay member of staff responsible for the upkeep of the church -- was in his late 40s or early 50s and had two children, said Gil Florini, a Catholic priest in Nice.

""He did his job as a sexton very well. He was a very kind person,"" said Florini.

Thursday's meeting was the third this month between the longtime foes, mediated by the United States and hosted by the United Nations at a base in southern Lebanon.
The meetings are the culmination of three years of diplomacy by Washington, and follow a series of deals under which three Arab nations - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan - agreed to establish full relations with Israel.
Lebanon has said its talks are strictly limited to their disputed boundary which lies in an area of potentially gas-rich Mediterranean water.
On Wednesday the two sides presented contrasting maps outlining proposed borders that actually increased the size of the disputed area, sources said.
The Lebanese proposal extended farther south than the border Lebanon previously presented to the United Nations, according to a Lebanese security source. The Israeli map pushed the boundary farther north than Israel's original position, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
""Representatives from the governments of Israel and Lebanon held productive talks mediated by the United States and hosted by the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon,"" the joint U.S.-UN statement said. ""The parties committed to continue negotiations next month.""

A senior Lebanese source said the two sides would meet again on Nov. 11.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai protesters criticised spending by King Maha Vajiralongkorn's palace and held a ""fashion show"" that parodied members of the royal family at a rally in Bangkok on Thursday that drew thousands of people.
What began as anti-government demonstrations in July have increasingly called for reforms of the monarchy, breaking a longstanding taboo and defying a law that sets a jail term of up to 15 years for criticising the king and his family.
The Palace has made no comment on the protests since they began. The government made no immediate comment on Thursday's event.
The protesters' show, with a red carpet parade by activists lampooning royalty, took place on the same day that one of the king's daughters, a designer, was to launch a new fashion collection.
Speakers at the rally denounced what they said was wasteful spending by the royal family at a time Thailand's tourist-reliant economy has been hit hard by the coronavirus.
""It wouldn’t be a problem if this wasn’t our money,"" student leader Jutatip Sirikhan told the crowd.
Protesters have called for reforms to the monarchy to reduce the king's powers. They have also demanded the reversal of changes that gave him control of some army units and a palace fortune valued in tens of billions of dollars.
The king has spent much of his time in Germany this year and on Monday protesters marched to the German embassy to request an inquiry into his actions and lifestyle there.
Germany does not believe the king has so far breached its ban on conducting politics while staying there, a parliamentary source in Berlin said on Wednesday. [nL8N2HJ7WH]

The Thai protesters also seek a new constitution and the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader who rejects their accusations he engineered last year's elections to keep power.

BURQA, West Bank (Reuters) - For many West Bank Palestinians, the olive tree is both a revered cultural emblem and an economic necessity - but it has also become a focal point of a struggle between them and Israeli settlers for a land they both claim. 
More than 1,000 trees owned by Palestinian farmers have been burned or damaged in the Israeli-occupied territory since the harvest began three weeks ago, according to a United Nations report.
The Oct 23 report by humanitarian affairs office UNOCHA has also logged 19 disruptions ""by people believed or known to be Israeli settlers,"" with 23 Palestinian farmers injured.
While the settlers dispute those figures, in normal years peace monitors accompany the farmers to protect the harvest. But the coronavirus pandemic has made this harder.
Some Israeli activists are still deploying. ""With COVID-19 it is impossible for foreigners to come, harder for Israelis,"" said one activist, Guy Butavia. 
Olive farmers in areas near some Israeli settlements say they face problems each year.
""When we try to reach our fields, the army protects the settlers and prevents us from accessing our olives,"" said Adnan Barakat, council head of Burqa village, near Ramallah.
In Burqa, Israeli settlers ""stoned and physically assaulted Palestinian olive pickers on three occasions, triggering clashes"", UNOCHA said. 
Calling on Israel to ensure the farmers' safety, U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov told the Security Council on Monday: ""Each year, the ability of Palestinians to harvest is compromised due to access restrictions, attacks and intimidation.""
Yigal Dilmoni, head of Yesha, the main settler council in the West Bank, said most of the accusations came from ""dubious"" sources.
""For many years now, extremist organisations... have been carrying out provocative actions and exploiting the harvest season to incite against Israeli civilians,"" he said.
""I live on the ground and see thousands of Palestinians harvesting their olives daily without any problem.""
BURNING BUSHES
Around 430,000 Israeli settlers live among three million Palestinians in the West Bank, territory that Israel captured in 1967. Settlers have also been targets of Palestinian stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks.
Palestinians claim the West Bank for a future state. But Israel cites its security needs and historical ties to the region.
Tensions rose this summer over Palestinian fears that newly re-elected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would implement pre-election promises to annex part of the West Bank.
Last week in Burqa, Reuters journalists there saw Palestinians and Israelis confronting each other. Israeli security forces intervened, firing tear gas and stun grenades towards Palestinians, who threw stones back.
A brush fire broke out amid the clashes and Israeli firing, and spread to nearby olive trees.
The Israeli military said security forces had coordinated with landowners to ensure safe picking, but were met with ""rioters"" hurling rocks.
""A few arson attempts were identified,"" a military statement said. ""Troops responded with riot dispersal means... During the incident, a fire broke out and several trees were damaged.""
The military said it ""would not allow the olive harvest to be used in order to harm Israeli civilians or security forces.""

""The Umrah pilgrimage is allowed for Muslims from across the world,"" Saudi state TV said, citing a statement from the Ministry of Pilgrimage. The Saudi-owned, Dubai-based TV channel Al-Arabiya said Umrah will be allowed from Nov. 1 
Umrah is a pilgrimage which can be undertaken at any time of the year, in contrast to Hajj, which has specific dates according to the Islamic lunar calendar.

Saudi Arabia closed its borders in February to foreign Umrah pilgrims, and in March stopped its own citizens and residents from taking part. In July, it allowed a limited number of domestic pilgrims to perform the Hajj.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Face masks and limits on numbers are important, but good ventilation technology is the most essential ingredient of all in reducing the risk of the coronavirus spreading at public events indoors, according to a German study.
And researchers say the study's results have implications for containing the epidemic among the broader population too.
Around 1,500 volunteers with face masks, hand sanitiser and proximity trackers attended an indoor pop-concert in Leipzig in August to assess how the virus spreads in large gatherings.
Reseachers simulated three scenarios with varying numbers of spectators and social-distancing standards, and created a computer model of the arena to analyse the flow of aerosols from infected virtual spectators.
""The most important finding for us was understanding how crucial it is to have good ventilation technology. This is key to lowering the risk of infection,"" said Stefan Moritz, leader of the RESTART-19 study at the University Medical School in Halle.
The study also found that reducing venue capacity, having multiple arena entrances and seating spectators can have a major impact on the number of contacts people accumulate.
Its recommendations include only allowing food to be eaten at seats, open-air waiting areas, mask-wearing for the concert's duration and employing stewards to make sure people stick to hygiene rules.
Researchers also developed an epidemiological model to analyse the impact of staging an event on the spread of the virus among the broader population.
They found hygiene measures such as mask-wearing and social-distancing should remain in place as long as the pandemic persists, while seating plans and number of guests should be adjusted based on the incidence of the virus.
""Events have the potential to fuel the epidemic by spreading pathogens, but if a hygiene concept is stuck to then the risk is very low,"" said Rafael Mikolajczyk, from Halle University's Institute for Medical Epidemiology.

The study's results have not yet been peer-reviewed.

Like many on opposite sides of the front lines, the two families have lost loved ones and seen their livelihoods and dreams destroyed by nearly a decade of conflict.
But while daunting obstacles still stand in the way of a lasting political settlement, the Bouzids are slowly repairing their own small corner of the country, the ransacked south Tripoli farm they returned to after fighting in the area ended in June.
""Dad, Mum and I would sit in the middle of the day and drink tea and enjoy the view of our crops. But then the war came and we fled,"" said Mohammed Bouzid, 45. ""After we returned, there was nothing left."" 
To the east in Benghazi, the Alis had to leave their Misrata Street neighbourhood when fighting engulfed Libya's second biggest city in 2014. 
They returned in 2018, so desperate to get home that they ignored official warnings about landmines and unexploded bombs. 
""I personally saw four mines exploding,"" said Nasira Abdullah Ali, who now lives with her mother and five brothers in an apartment surrounded by ruins. 
Most of the recent warfare was in the west as Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) waged a 14-month campaign to seize Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). 
Earlier battles during the chaotic years since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that ousted long-time national leader Muammar Gaddafi had ruined large parts of Benghazi and other cities. 
Last week the two sides agreed a ceasefire and next month the United Nations will host a meeting to seek a lasting political settlement and set a date for elections. 
Libyans have been through broken ceasefires and peace talks before. Many are sceptical that it will be different this time. 
REVIVING A BARREN FARM
As they work their farm, pulling enough spent ammunition from the fields to fill 10 sacks, Mohammed Bouzid and his 70-year-old father Younes rue their burnt fruit trees and their lost cattle and sheep.
""It was all green. I had watered these orange trees since I was seven years old. When we came back we found it was all dry,"" said Mohammed.
They left the farm in the Ain Zara district when Haftar launched his war last year, returning only after his retreat.
Street after street in the neighbourhood shows the scars of fighting, with electricity lines cut, and shops and houses burned out. The destruction reached the Bouzids' farm a few minutes' drive away down a rough track. 
""All you can see is a result of personal effort and the savings we have left. There is no electricity or water. I have a well and used a generator to run the pump to irrigate the farm,"" Younes said. 
Now his family, which has friends in eastern Libya, just wants the bloodshed to end, he said. 
BACK AMONG THE RUINS
The view from Nasira Abdullah Ali's apartment is of smashed concrete. Bullet marks and shellholes puncture the walls of nearby buildings.
Together with the rest of her family, the 30-year-old lawyer spent the years away from Misrata Street on a farm and then in a room in a school.
The family business - a small neighbourhood supermarket - was smashed during their absence. 
However, for some neighbours, things were worse. Retired soldier Jamal al-Mellah and his wife have to live in the house of a friend after their home was destroyed.
Though partly destroyed, the Alis' apartment is still serviceable, even if they had to rig up electricity wires themselves and carry their own water, and Nasira's brothers now have make ends meet doing casual daily work. 
""But when we returned we were happy. It was a beautiful, wonderful feeling to be home,"" she said.

YEREVAN (Reuters) - When conflict broke out in Nagorno-Karabakh last month, Aghasi Asatryan was thousands of kilometres away in Germany, embarking on a career as an IT specialist.
The 29-year-old Armenian national immediately applied for vacation, citing a family matter, and flew back to Yerevan, his home town. 
On a hillside above the Armenian capital, he began combat training at a camp founded by veterans of a previous war in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave controlled by ethnic Armenians but internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan. 
""My plan is to get prepared and to go to the front line,"" Asatryan said. Slung across his shoulder was a wooden copy of an AK-47 assault rifle, a training aid given to each volunteer at the camp.
More than 1,000 people have died in a month of clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, which Azerbaijan considers to be illegally occupied. [nL1N2HJ0WZ]
It rejects any move to leave Armenians in control there, while Armenia regards the territory as part of its historic homeland and says the population there needs its protection.
Asatryan moved to Germany seven years ago as a student, avoiding conscription. He has neither served in the army nor held a gun before and said he could not tell his bosses that he was going back home to fight.
""My German employers wouldn't understand a man who would want to go to war,"" he said. ""But I know that we, the Armenians, wouldn't have survived so many centuries without understanding that every man should fight for his homeland.""
Asatryan is one of hundreds of volunteers from as far afield as Argentina and the United States to have joined the VOMA Survival School in recent weeks.
Its founder, Vova Vartanov, fought in the 1991-94 war in Nagorno-Karabakh in which about 30,000 people were killed. He has returned to the front line as leader of a volunteer battalion.
Reuters reporters saw dozens of men and women in the camp, split into groups for lessons on using hand grenades and repelling a gun attack. Some volunteers were practising rock-climbing using ropes and the concrete wall of a waste dump.
Before the latest fighting broke out on Sept. 27, the school would attract 20 to 30 people at a time for training in readiness for a renewed war. One of the instructors, Karapet Aghajanyan, said ""hundreds"" from the Armenian diaspora had now come.
Armenia's defence ministry said this month that around 10,000 people volunteered to take up arms on the first day of fighting. [nL8N2GZ38H]
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said 55,000 volunteers were registered between July 12 and July 22 after fighting in another region. It said that information about more recent volunteers was classified.
Knarik Karaminasyan, a 21-year-old English teacher from Yerevan, decided to join the volunteers as soon as she learned that women were welcome and could be sent to the front line as medical workers or cooks.
""It was hard at the beginning and I even had nightmares,"" she said. Now she feels more comfortable.

""Here, I feel better than at home, where I was just scrolling through Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), reading the news and panicking... Now I feel that I'm getting ready for something important.""

NICE, France (Reuters) - A knife-wielding attacker shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" beheaded a woman and killed two other people in a suspected terrorist act at a church in the French city of Nice on Thursday, while a gunman was shot dead by police in a separate incident.
Within hours of the Nice attack, police killed a man who had threatened passersby with a handgun in Montfavet, near the southern French city of Avignon. He was also shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest), according to radio station Europe 1.
In Saudi Arabia on Thursday, state television reported that a Saudi man had been arrested in the city of Jeddah after attacking and injuring a guard at the French consulate.
The French Embassy said the consulate was subject to an ""attack by knife which targeted a guard"", adding the guard was taken to hospital and his life was not in danger.
Nice's mayor, Christian Estrosi, who described the attack in his city as terrorism, said on Twitter it had happened in or near Notre Dame church and was similar to the beheading of French teacher Samuel Paty in an attack this month in Paris.
Estrosi said the attacker had repeatedly shouted the phrase ""Allahu Akbar"", even after he had been detained by police.
One of the people killed inside the church was believed to be the church warden, Estrosi said, adding that a woman had tried to escape from inside the church and had fled into a bar opposite the 19th century neo-Gothic building.
""The suspected knife attacker was shot by police while being detained, he is on his way to hospital, he is alive,"" Estrosi told reporters.
""Enough is enough,"" Estrosi said. ""It's time now for France to exonerate itself from the laws of peace in order to definitively wipe out Islamo-fascism from our territory.""
Reuters journalists at the scene said police armed with automatic weapons had put up a security cordon around the church, which is on Nice's Jean Medecin avenue, the city's main shopping thoroughfare. Ambulances and fire service vehicles were also at the scene. 
SOLIDARITY
French President Emmanuel Macron is due to visit Nice, Estrosi said.
In Paris, lawmakers in the National Assembly observed a minute's silence in solidarity with the victims. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the people of Nice ""can count on the support of the city of Paris and of Parisians"". 
Police said three people were confirmed to have died in the attack and several were injured. The French anti-terrorist prosecutor's department said it had been asked to investigate.
A police source said a woman was decapitated. French far-right politician Marine Le Pen also spoke of a decapitation having occurred in the attack.
A representative of the French Council for the Muslim Faith strongly condemned the attack. ""As a sign of mourning and solidarity with the victims and their loved ones, I call on all Muslims in France to cancel all the celebrations of the holiday of Mawlid."". 
The holiday is the birthday of the Prophet Mohammad, which is being celebrated Thursday.
Estrosi said the victims had been killed in a ""horrible way"".
""The methods match, without doubt, those used against the brave teacher in Conflans Sainte Honorine, Samuel Paty,"" he said, referring to a French teacher beheaded earlier this month in an attack in a suburb of Paris.
The attack comes while France is still reeling from the beheading earlier this month of middle school teacher Paty by a man of Chechen origin. 
The attacker had said he wanted to punish Paty for showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics lesson.
It was not immediately clear if Thursday's attack was connected to the cartoons, which Muslims consider to be blasphemous.
Since Paty's killing, French officials - backed by many ordinary citizens - have re-asserted the right to display the cartoons, and the images have been widely displayed at marches in solidarity with the killed teacher.
That has prompted an outpouring of anger in parts of the Muslim world, with some governments accusing Macron of pursuing an anti-Islam agenda.

In a comment on recent beheadings in France, the Kremlin said on Thursday it was unacceptable to kill people, but also wrong to insult the feelings of religious believers.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko replaced his interior minister and named three security hawks to new roles on Thursday in an attempt to tighten his grip on the country after nearly 12 weeks of mass protests.
Ivan Kubrakov, who as head of police in the capital Minsk has led the crackdown on the biggest demonstrations, was appointed interior minister.
His predecessor, Yuri Karayev, was one of three men named to new roles as presidential aides and ""inspectors"" responsible for key regions of the country.
Lukashenko's position appears more secure after a national strike call by the opposition failed to bring the economy to a halt this week. Security forces have arrested more than 16,000 people since a presidential election on Aug. 9 which the opposition and Western government say was rigged.
But protests continue, especially at universities, and the reshuffle suggests the veteran leader is concerned at the time it is taking to stamp out opposition and feels the need to do more.
""Lukashenko is nervous and in a flap because he can't quell the protests. He thinks if he shuffles the deck of security personnel, it will have an effect. Lukashenko is still betting on stifling the protests,"" said political analyst Alexander Klaskovsky.
Lukashenko also ordered the strengthening of armed volunteer militia units, which in theory already exist but in practice have not played a role in the crisis till now.
""NOT YET OVER""
The two other two new presidential aides are Valery Vakulchik, who spent eight years as head of the KGB security police, and former deputy interior minister Alexander Barsukov.
Barsukov will be responsible for Minsk, Vakulchik for Brest on the Polish border, and Karayev for Grodno, near the borders with Poland and Lithuania.
The emphasis on security in regions bordering NATO countries is consistent with repeated allegations by Lukashenko that NATO and the West are whipping up unrest in Belarus. In September he staged a high-profile series of military exercises with his key ally, Russia.
Addressing the three new aides, Lukashenko said they were heading to very important areas of the country ""in connection with the events that have occurred and are not yet over - we still don't know what this may result in"".
""Why you? You are military people, you're knowledgeable, you don't need to be brought up to speed and taught.""
Karayev, Barsukov, Vakulchik and Kubrakov were all hit with European Union travel bans and asset freezes earlier this month for their role in the repression, intimidation and arbitrary arrest of protesters since the election. The first three were also accused of responsibility for torture.
The United States has also imposed sanctions on Karayev, Barsukov and Kubrakov.
Belarus denies torturing prisoners and Karayev, the outgoing interior minister, has described its police force as one of the most humane in the world.

U.S. Democratic candidate Joe Biden has said he will expand sanctions on Lukashenko's ""henchmen"" if he wins next week's presidential election.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The United States and Greenland have agreed to strengthen economic and trade ties after resolving a dispute over a service contract to a U.S. air base in the north of the Arctic island.
The Thule Air Base has been a sore point between the United States, Greenland and Denmark since the Pentagon in 2014 awarded a service contract to a U.S. company, breaking a decade-long agreement of keeping it in Danish-Greenlandic hands. 
After U.S. President Donald Trump's rebuffed attempt to buy the island last year, the United States, in a renewed focus on the Arctic, set up a consulate in Greenland and also donated $12 million in aid towards developing the small economy. 
""The case is of great importance to Greenland in principle,"" Greenland's foreign minister, Steen Lynge, said in a joint statement between Greenland and Denmark released late on Wednesday. 
""We are proud that Pituffik (Thule) and Greenland's key role in American security has now been recognised.""
Under the new agreement, the United States is committed to awarding the next contract, most likely in 2024, to a company registered in Greenland or Denmark, with a majority ownership by Danes or Greenlanders.
Greenland, a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, is largely dependent on state aid from Denmark, which also handles most foreign and security affairs. 
Greenland is important for the U.S. military and its ballistic missile early warning system, as it balances Russian and Chinese commercial and military buildups in the Arctic. The Thule base mainly operates a missile warning system and space and satellite surveillance.
Based on a 1951 treaty with Denmark, the United States has stationed military personnel on Thule, known as Pituffik in Greenlandic, ever since the Cold War, but it does not pay rent. 
Up until 2014, it did however pay a Danish-Greenlandic company, Greenland Contractors, to service the air base, a contract worth about 600 million Danish crowns ($95 million) a year, which was viewed as an important contribution to the island economy.
As part of the deal announced on Wednesday, Greenland and the United states also agreed to strengthen ties on trade, mining, education and tourism.

The exchange, days ahead of the U.S. elections, came as U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper toured Asia with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo where they had urged countries to cooperate with the United States to confront the security threats posed by China, a position China has criticised as a Cold War mentality and zero-sum mindset. 
Chinese and U.S. militaries held a video conference meeting about crisis communication on Oct. 28-29, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian said on Thursday. 
According to Wu, Esper denied a media report about the United States studying a plan to attack Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea using an MQ-9 drone in the event that the U.S. presidential election was not looking favourable for President Donald Trump. 
Esper said the United States ""has no intention of creating a military crisis with the Chinese,"" according to Wu.
""We urge the U.S. to walk the talk, keep its promise, and take measures to prevent provoking China military in the air and sea,"" Wu said, adding that China will resolutely counter-strike if provoked with an attack at sea.
Both militaries will exchange views via video conferencing on humanitarian aid in mid-November and on maritime security before the end of the year, Wu said.

1522,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Factbox: Key details from fifth plenum of China's Communist Party,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Central Committee, the largest of the ruling Communist Party's top decision-making bodies, have concluded a four-day meeting on China's economic and social policy goals for the next five years. 
The final blueprint will be approved and published when the National People's Congress, or parliament, meets in its annual session next year.
Below are some key details from the communique of the plenum, the fifth meeting of the Central Committee since the once-in-five years Communist Party congress in 2017, as released by state media on Thursday. Longer-term goals were also discussed.
GDP GOALS
Party leadership said in the communique that the value of China's gross domestic product is expected to exceed 100 trillion yuan ($14.92 trillion) this year. That is just a touch more than in 2019, and puts China on course to narrowly miss a previous goal of doubling GDP in the decade to 2020, as the economy needs to grow at least 5.6% this year to hit the target. The communique also said China will aim to achieve sustained and healthy economic development in 2021-2025, with a focus on higher quality growth. It remains unclear whether a numerical growth target would be set for the five-year period when the plan is published next year. The party also made no mention of doubling GDP over the next decade, but added that China will aim to raise per capita GDP to the level of moderately developed nations by 2035. 
DUAL CIRCULATION
Little was disclosed for the moment on how China would implement the ""dual circulation"" model, first proposed by Xi in May. The strategy is for China to depend mainly on ""domestic circulation"" for its next phase of development, supported by external resources through ""international circulation"". In the communique, the party said the model would be promoted, combining efforts to expand domestic demand with supply-side reforms. 
TECHNOLOGY
Investors were awaiting new steps on boosting China's technological innovation, key to moving the world's second-largest economy up the global value chain, especially with the United States' strangling supply of parts to Chinese tech giants. The communique said China would make technological self-sufficiency a ""strategic support"" for national development, with an aim to achieve major breakthroughs in key technologies by 2035. It also said China would strengthen national security capabilities and maintain ""strategic composure"" in the face of newly emerged challenges and conflicts internationally. Defence capabilities would be beefed up in line with the economy, the communique said. 
COMMODITIES, ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT
The communique said China would speed up and push forward green and low-carbon development. There was no immediate word on boosting strategic reserves across commodities and energy to ensure self-sufficiency. 
REFORMS
The party said in the communique that China would deepen reforms in all aspects, but gave few details. It reiterated that China would let the market play a decisive role in resources allocation. China would also make a ""major breakthrough"" in reforms on property rights. The party said China would promote coordinated regional development and a new urbanisation drive. Economists say China's urban-rural income gap is widening, and development disparities between prosperous coastal provinces and the hinterland have increased. 
GREYING POPULATION
China is facing what experts describe as a demographic time-bomb as its elderly population is increasing while its workforce is dwindling, partly due to a one-child policy in place for around four decades. The party decided in a previous plenum in 2015 to ditch that policy. In Thursday's communique, the party said China would implement strategies to address the ageing population, without elaborating. 
TAIWAN, HONG KONG, MACAU
The communique said China would promote Taiwan's reunification with the mainland and peaceful cross-straits development. China regards Taiwan as a wayward province to be brought back under its sovereignty by force, if necessary. China would also maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau.

The army confirmed the attack on Baeti village in North Kivu province, around 20 km (12 miles) west of the city of Oicha, but declined to give a death toll.
The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, has killed more than 1,000 civilians since the start of 2019, according to U.N. figures, despite repeated military campaigns aimed at destroying it.
""We have a provisional death toll of 18 people killed in an atrocious way,"" said Kinos Katuho, president of a local civil rights group.
""It really creates pain in our hearts, a total panic in the village,"" said Masisa Mushogoro, head of a development committee in Baeti. ""We don't know if tomorrow the ADF will come back here again.""
Authorities have accused the armed group of attacking the main prison in the city of Beni on Oct. 20, releasing more than 1,300 inmates, including an unknown number of militiamen and their own fighters.
Reprisal attacks against civilians have increased sharply since the army began a counter-insurgency operation against the ADF a year ago, dislodging it from several bases near the Ugandan border.
ADF combatants dispersed into small groups and fled into other areas, burning down entire villages, destroying health centres and schools, and abducting men, women and children. The violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the U.N..

""The results should not be recognised by any country in the world, should not be recognised by the African Union and the Commonwealth,"" Lissu told Reuters, urging the world to take action against ""those who perpetrated this travesty.""
Officials at the electoral commission were not immediately available for comment. On Wednesday, the Commission denied allegations of fake ballots, saying they were unofficial and unsubstantiated.
Lissu, 52, was shot 16 times in 2017 in what remains an unsolved case. He returned from three years in exile in July. 
Lissu said his party's polling agents had been prevented into getting into polling stations and that stuffed ballots had been forced into polling stations across the country.
""This was a mockery of elections, a mockery of democracy,"" he said. He later told reporters ""We are not accepting anything that has been done and any results.""
Magufuli, 61, is looking to extend the rule of the CCM party, a version of which has held power since independence from Britain in 1961. It won the presidency with 58% of votes in 2015 and now holds about three-quarters of parliamentary seats.
In the race for 264 parliamentary seats, the leader of the opposition in the assembly, Freeman Mbowe, lost his seat in the north to his CCM challenger Saasisha Mafuwe, state broadcaster TBC reported.
While campaigning, Magufuli pledged to boost growth in East Africa's third largest economy with infrastructure projects kickstarted in his first term.
But the opposition and rights groups have complained that his administration has cracked down on critical voices, closing down media outlets and preventing opposition public rallies.
Opposition parties said electoral authorities disqualified dozens of their parliamentary candidates. The government has denied suppressing dissent and the National Electoral Commission has rejected charges of unfair treatment.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - The European Union said an escalation in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was ""unacceptable"" and called for new peace talks as Armenia and Azerbaijan once more traded accusations of shelling in and around the mountain enclave on Thursday.
The office of Nagorno-Karabakh's human rights ombudsman said more than a dozen shells had fallen on Stepanakert, the enclave's largest city, a day after a maternity hospital there was struck. Two civilians were wounded.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said in a statement that Armenia had fired at its military units and civilian settlements along the front line, and that the Azeri settlements of Terter and Gornaboy to the north of Nagorno-Karabakh had been shelled.
The worst fighting in the South Caucasus for nearly 30 years has raised fears of a wider war that could suck in Russia and Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan. It also poses a threat to pipelines carrying oil and gas from Azerbaijan to world markets.
Three ceasefires have failed to hold and civilians were killed on either side of the conflict on Wednesday.
""The European Union finds it unacceptable that after three agreements brokered by Russia, France and the United States on a ceasefire, the fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh still continues,"" European Commission foreign affairs and security policy spokesman Peter Stano said in a statement late on Wednesday.
The EU executive urged the sides to return without delay to ""substantive negotiations"" on a peaceful settlement as last agreed in Washington on Oct. 25. 
The OSCE Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, had been due to meet the Azeri and Armenian foreign ministers in Geneva on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether this meeting would take place.
Turkey has demanded a bigger role in any peace negotiations.
The defence ministry of the Nagorno-Karabakh region said on Thursday it had suffered 51 more casualties, taking its military death toll to 1,119 since fighting erupted on Sept. 27.
Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military casualties. Russia has estimated as many as 5,000 deaths on both sides.

Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war in the region.

1526,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Republican moderate Susan Collins fights for her political life in Trump era,"By David Morgan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Susan Collins is fighting for her political life in a race that could decide control of the Senate, having enjoyed years of popularity as an independent-minded moderate before fellow Republican Donald Trump entered the White House.
A senator from Maine since 1997 who has voted with Trump two-thirds of the time, Collins is among nine Republicans whose prospects for re-election have been thrown into doubt in a chamber where their party holds a mere 53-47 majority.
Trailing her Democratic rival in opinion polls and fundraising, Collins, 67, faces a reckoning with longtime supporters, unsettled by her tepid criticisms of Trump and her votes for White House priorities including the 2018 confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh despite charges of sexual misconduct, which he denied.
Incurring Trump's wrath, Collins on Monday became the sole Republican senator to reject his choice of Amy Coney Barrett to fill another Supreme Court seat. She said it was inappropriate to fill the vacancy so close to a presidential election. 
Collins has voted with Trump 67.5% of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight.com, making her the Senate Republican least aligned with the president. But that distinction may not save her career in Maine.
Democratic rival Sara Gideon, the 48-year-old speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, has led Collins in opinion polls since early July while driving home the message that the Republican long viewed as independent of her party has knuckled under to Trump.
Maine has a history of electing moderate Republicans, including Senator Margaret Chase Smith, the first woman to serve in both the U.S. House of Representatives and then the Senate before leaving office in 1973. 
It also elected Paul LePage, who served as governor from 2011 to 2019 and brought a proto-Trumpian combative style of politics to the mostly rural far northeastern state.
IN A BIND
Political analyst Jessica Taylor, who tracks Senate races for the Cook Political Report said Collins was in a bind.
""She can't move to the center any more or she loses conservatives and Trump voters in the state. But some of the votes she had to take turned off independents and conservative Democrats that she's long been able to get and really ignited the liberal grassroots against her,"" Taylor said.
The latest Pan Atlantic Research poll shows Gideon leading Collins by seven percentage points, only half of the 14-point lead that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden holds over Trump in Maine.
""For Senator Collins, the focus of this race has always been on the people of Maine and what she can do for them,"" Collins campaign spokeswoman Annie Clark said in a statement.
Collins has a narrow path to reelection, if she can lock in Republican support and attract enough independents, who represent one-third of state voters. 
She last won re-election in 2014 with more than 68% of the vote. But this year, her campaign faces a number of headwinds including a voter disapproval rating above 50%, a cash disadvantage against Gideon and a ranked-choice state voting system that could help put the Democrat over the top.
Gideon has massively out-fundraised Collins, collecting a total of $69.5 million in campaign donations as of Oct. 14, vs. Collins' $27 million, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. 

The Democrat's haul left her with a whopping $20.7 million in cash on hand, as the race entered its final three weeks, compared with Collins, who had $4.4 million.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - As the number of coronavirus deaths climbs in Nepal, workers at the only crematorium in Kathmandu designated to handle the victims have been working past midnight, their meagre wages supplemented by less than 50 U.S. cents for each corpse.
Elsewhere in a country that ranks among the world's poorest, the bodies are burned on funeral pyres and their ashes are buried, but in the capital they are brought to the crematorium in the Pashupatinath Hindu temple complex.
""There is hardly any space for emotion,"" Shyam Kharel, one of the workers there, told Reuters as he got ready to place a yellow bag containing a body in the incinerator. 
“Initially there were not many, hardly five or six, and sometimes none at all for days,” Kharel said. “But now it goes up to 25 or 26 in a day.”
Despite being provided protective equipment, Kharel said five of his co-workers had been infected.
Keeping count of infections and deaths is a challenge in Nepal, a country of 30 million strung along the southern Himalayas, as testing is limited, rendering confirmed cases of COVID-19 potentially far below the actual number.
Latest government figures show Nepal's total cases stood at 162,354, including 887 deaths. The official daily death toll has been running at around 15 a day since a peak of 26 seen on Oct. 21.
Nepal was quick to enter a lockdown when its second COVID-19 case was confirmed in March. But protesters angry at the government's handling of the epidemic clashed with police in June.
Restrictions were eased at the end of July and, despite a rise in infections since, the government has been reluctant to tighten up again as the economy was teetering, and Nepal's poor could ill-afford to stay away from markets or work.
Prime Minister K.P Sharma Oli has told Nepalis that they have strong immunity and has advised them to strengthen it with traditional remedies like drinking hot water with tumeric. 
The old, densely populated city of Kathmandu and its temple studded valley account for 44 percent of Nepal's infections and more than one-thirds of deaths.
Authorities say the nation’s overstretched health infrastructure, with few critical care beds, is in danger of being overwhelmed.
Kharel waited grimly for more victims to arrive at the crematorium.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Analysis: Biden presidency for Turkey would mean tougher U.S. stance but chance to repair ties,"By Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Days after Turkey took delivery of Russian missile defense systems in July 2019, top security officials in the Trump administration were in full agreement that Washington should deliver on its threat to impose sanctions on its NATO ally.
The U.S. State Department had sent its recommendations to the National Security Council calling for prompt sanctions on Turkish individuals and entities and the measures were going to be rolled out once President Donald Trump approved.
He never did, disagreeing with his closest advisers, two sources familiar with Trump's decision-making said. To date, he has refused to impose sanctions on Ankara for buying the Russian S-400 missiles, which Washington says compromise NATO defenses.
While overruling advisers is common in Trump's policy playbook, his instinct to go lightly on Turkey has prevented severely fractured ties between Ankara and Washington from total collapse.
The decades-old partnership between the NATO allies has gone through unprecedented tumult in the past five years over disagreements on Syria policy, Ankara's closer ties with Moscow, its naval ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean, U.S. charges against a state-owned Turkish bank and erosion of rights and freedoms in Turkey.
Should Republican Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden win Tuesday's election, as opinion polls suggest, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will be losing his most valuable ally in Washington, leaving Ankara vulnerable to the wrath of a deeply antagonized U.S. Congress and some U.S. agencies skeptical of Turkey.
Biden, who called Erdogan an 'autocrat' last December, is expected to be tougher on Turkey, particularly over its weakening of human rights and democratic norms, and could impose sanctions over Ankara's purchase of the Russian S-400s after Erdogan last week confirmed testing https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2781HC was underway.
Still, Biden's priority to counter Russia and Iran and reinvest in multilateral alliances could play into Ankara's hands, analysts said.
""Biden is unlikely to lurch into a reflexively punitive approach, as many seem to assume, but he will likely close the gap between the professional ranks of the U.S. government bureaucracy and the White House that has yawned wide under Trump,"" said Max Hoffman, associate director at the Center for American Progress.
""That means Erdogan will not be able to upend U.S. policy with one call to the White House,"" he said.
Trump has publicly praised Erdogan and his combative ruling style, calling him ""a friend"" and ""hell of a leader."" Washington has largely stayed quiet in the face of an increasingly authoritarian Erdogan.
""I think it's fair to say you would see stronger pushback (from a Biden administration) against the Turkish government where it does run counter to U.S. interests,"" Torrey Taussig, research director at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center said, while noting that Turkey's democratic backsliding would likely be a more primary concern.
Biden campaign officials declined to comment for this story.
CONGRESS 'OUT OF PATIENCE' 
One of Biden's first foreign policy moves would be to restore Washington's commitment to alliances, first and foremost to NATO, whose cohesion has been damaged under Trump as he questioned the relevance of the 70-year-old organization.
To repair the transatlantic alliance, analysts said, Biden will have to work with Turkey, or at least try.
""I expect Biden will reach out to Erdogan because the priority is going to be to resuscitate NATO and you know you can't do that without Turkey,"" said Soner Cagaptay, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
But that effort will clash with mounting pressure from the U.S. Congress to impose Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), legislation that passed 98-2 in the U.S. Senate, designed to punish aggression by Russia, Iran and North Korea and deter others from cooperating with them.
""Congress has already run out of patience,"" Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said in an interview. ""I think you will find bipartisan support in Congress to push the administration, regardless of which administration, to follow through on the CAATSA sanctions.""
Washington's punishment to Ankara's Russian missile purchase so far has been expelling Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program. But Turkish companies still produce components of the jets.
Ankara and Washington have a window of six to nine months to reset ties and build goodwill, Emre Peker, director at Eurasia Group, wrote in a recent research note, with ""risk of accidents"" remaining high and increasing over time.
""Given the options to punish Turkey, and short of Ankara renouncing its S-400s, Biden will likely start to impose toward end-2021 less onerous measures under CAATSA and threaten more severe action unless Turkey reverses course. CAATSA could be catastrophic for Turkey,"" Peker wrote.
Turkey's beleaguered lira is particularly vulnerable to U.S. sanctions.
For now, Ankara gives no indications of walking back.

The tests ""have been and are being conducted,"" Erdogan said on Friday, adding in what sounded like a challenge to America: ""Whatever your sanctions are, don't hold back.""

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>","Analysis: If Biden wins U.S. election, Brazil's Bolsonaro loses key trade, climate ally","By Anthony Boadle and Lisandra Paraguassu
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Victory by Democrat Joe Biden in next week's U.S. presidential election could put the environment and human rights at the top of the country's agenda with Brazil, complicating relations with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and jeopardizing trade, diplomats and analysts say.
If Biden wins Tuesday's vote, Bolsonaro would lose a diplomatic ally and find himself isolated in his approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, which he modeled on U.S. President Donald Trump's disregard for the gravity of the virus. 
The two leaders have persistently downplayed the pandemic even as their countries suffered from the world's most deadly outbreaks.
Pressure from Biden to curb deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and concern for climate change would be a major departure from Trump's approach and could cause frictions with Bolsonaro, according to Mike Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank that focuses on relations within the Americas.
""There are people in the Democratic Party that would like to go after Bolsonaro and be very tough with him on this issue, and join forces with the Europeans to apply significant pressure,"" Shifter said in a telephone interview.
Concerns for LGBT rights, and those of women and indigenous people, which were not on the agenda under Trump, will be raised by a Biden administration, Shifter said.
Brazil's marginalized communities, including LGBT people and Afro-Brazilians, say violence against its members has increased under a president known for homophobic and racist comments during his time as a congressman.
Indigenous leaders say that Bolsonaro's plan to economically exploit the Amazon has encouraged invasions of reservation lands by illegal loggers and gold miners.
During last month's first presidential debate against Trump, Biden said the rainforest was being ""torn down"" and proposed countries offer Brazil $20 billion to stop deforestation or face ""economic consequences.""
Bolsonaro slammed the statements as ""coward threats"" of sanctions. The president's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
TRADE 
Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to Washington, expects Brazil's exports to suffer if Biden joins efforts by European nations to combat Amazon deforestation. U.S. backing could strengthen calls in Europe for the boycotts of food exports from Brazil, he said.
Brazil's agricultural produce accounts for one quarter of its exports. Despite close ties between Bolsonaro and Trump, Brazilian exports to the United States, its second largest trade partner after China, fell by 31.5% in the first nine months of this year to their lowest level in a decade partly due Washington's protectionist policies.
Although the United States is more of a competitor than a major export market for Brazil's key agricultural commodities, a critical stance from a newly elected president would pile further pressure on major buyers of Brazil's beef and soy, which have been linked to deforestation. 
That could leave Brazil ever more reliant on China, frustrating Bolsonaro's conservative base, analysts said.
""This could have concrete consequences for Brazilian agricultural exports and the financing of projects in Brazil,"" Barbosa said. 
The U.S. and Brazilian governments signed trade and investment agreements last week.
Biden is unlikely to undo those advances, but plans for a free trade deal heralded by Bolsonaro won't happen if the Democrat becomes president and puts the environment at the forefront of his agenda, said Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, dedicated to promoting business in the hemisphere.
Biden will try to maintain good relations with Brazil for the sake of U.S. interests in South America, Shifter added.
When it comes to opposing China's growing influence in Latin America, there will be little change, because it is one issue in Washington today where there is bipartisan support, Farnsworth said.
But Biden likely will take a softer approach and drop Trump's aggressive stance of forcing Brazil and other nations in the region to choose between the United States and China.
The Trump administration has stepped up efforts to convince countries to exclude Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] from the 5G market, citing security concerns, and it has offered credit for carriers to buy from companies outside China.

With Biden in the White House, countries like Brazil that do business with Huawei will not be cut off, Farnsworth said.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam hunted for survivors on Thursday after landslides triggered by Typhoon Molave, one of its strongest storms in decades, lashed a central region already reeling from weeks of heavy rains that have killed at least 160 people.
Hundreds of soldiers with heavy equipment were deployed to landslides in remote areas of Quang Nam province, where 19 people were killed and 12 were missing.
At the site of one landslide that buried a village of 53 people, rescue workers pulled 33 survivors from the mud, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.
""The whole village was flattened,"" Ho Thi Ha, who lost her father in the landslide, told Tuoi Tre.
""There's nothing left"". 
As well as the dead scores more were still missing, mostly in landslides, as a result of a succession of storms which have hammered Vietnam since early October.
The bodies of 12 fishermen were found at sea on Thursday and the navy was searching for 14 others missing since their boats sank while trying to come ashore two days earlier, state broadcaster VTV reported. 
""We can forecast the storm path or the amount of rain, but can't predict when landslides happen,"" Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said in a statement.
Complicating rescue efforts has been the emergence of un-exploded bombs, revealed by heavy rains. At least seven American MK82 bombs from the U.S.-Vietnam war were discovered in the central province of Quang Tri on Thursday, state media said.
More than a million people have been affected for weeks by the storms, which have caused heavy rains and some of the worst flooding in years in central Vietnam, pushing relief agencies to their limits. 
Molave hit the Philippines at the weekend and deaths there from mudslides and floods rose to 16 on Thursday. 
It damaged 56,000 homes in Vietnam and left millions without electricity, with heavy rain expected in the central region until Saturday. 

The typhoon weakened to a tropical depression after making landfall on Wednesday and by Thursday afternoon, the skies over the worst affected areas had cleared, VTV said, helping rescue efforts.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Britain says it is doing everything it can to avoid national lockdown,"By Sarah Young and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will do everything it can to avoid ordering a second national COVID-19 lockdown because it believes it will do more harm than good to the country, a minister said on Thursday. 
Coronavirus cases are surging in every region of Britain, which suffered the worst death toll in Europe and the deepest contraction of any G7 leading economy after it delayed a lockdown when the first wave of the pandemic hit in March. 
But as France and Germany ordered new national closures, housing minister Robert Jenrick said the British government's clear policy was to use the tough local restrictions that were recently imposed on swathes of northern England. 
""The judgement of the government today is that a blanket national lockdown is not appropriate, would do more harm than good,"" he told Times Radio.
""Although it does have some advantages, it also brings with it great harm to people's lives and livelihoods, real damage to the economy ... and a lot of harm to broader health and wellbeing."" 
The government's approach to tackling the virus is kept under review, however, Jenrick said. 
After a lull in the summer, the virus started to spread again in September and an Imperial College study published on Thursday showed cases doubling every nine days, with nearly 100,000 people infected in England each day.. 
Some scientists say more drastic restrictions should be brought in but the government is battling to keep the economy open after output plunged by 20% in the second quarter and public debt rose above 2 trillion pounds.
Steven Riley, author of the Imperial College study, told BBC Radio that Britain should act sooner rather than later and David Nabarro, a WHO special envoy, said he was surprised and disturbed by how quickly the virus was surging across Europe. 
The main concern now, he said, was to prevent hospitals from filling up with COVID-19 cases because that would lead to a rise in unrelated deaths. British data showed there were 9,520 patients in hospital with COVID, the highest level since May 14.

""That's where I think that the big risk lies now,"" Nabarro told the BBC.

Transport officials cut down the yellow box gum tree, estimated by Indigenous Djab Wurrung people to be hundreds of years old, on Monday, when police arrested more than 50 people camped out at the area to try to save it, according to news reports and social media. 
Victoria state's Supreme Court granted a stop-work order until Nov. 19 for the 12 km roadworks that would impact the area significant to Djab Wurrung women, who traditionally used it for birthing practices, near the town of Buangor, 170 km (106 miles) northwest of Melbourne.
""They can destroy Country and they can destroy trees but they can’t destroy our spirit,"" a spokesman for the protesters, Zellanach Djab Mara, said in a statement from the camp, known as the Djab Wurrung Embassy.
The destruction of the tree comes five months after mining company Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) destroyed, with state approval, a sacred rockshelter in Western Australia that was 46,000 years old, sparking an outcry, executive dismissals, a parliamentary enquiry and an acceleration in state legal reform. 
State highway authority Major Road Projects Victoria wants to realign the stretch of highway after a series of fatal crashes in recent years.
""The tree ... has not been assessed as having tangible heritage values,"" by traditional owners that represent the Djab Wurrung people, the authority said.
The Easter Marr Aboriginal Corporation (EMAC), which legally represents the area, said that the tree, while majestic, did not appear to have been altered by Aboriginal people for usage in cultural traditions.
""Over several years, EMAC fought an exhaustive battle to save culturally significant trees, to the extent possible given our statutory limitations,"" it said.
An earlier road realignment it secured had saved 16 trees that were identified as culturally significant, including two birthing trees, ""marker"", ""directions"" and ""grandmother"" trees, it said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday said Washington would find new ways to cooperate with Indonesia in the South China Sea and respected Jakarta's efforts to safeguard its own waters while rejecting China's ""unlawful"" claims in the area.
Pompeo's visit to Indonesia comes amid a five-nation swing through Asia, where he has sought to strengthen strategic and economic ties amid rising tensions between the United States and China.
In a joint news conference with his Indonesian counterpart, Retno Marsudi, he hailed Jakarta's ""decisive action"" to protect its sovereignty in the waters near the Natuna Islands, which China also claims as its territory.
Pompeo said China's claim was ""unlawful"". 
""I am looking forward to co-operating together in the new ways to ensure maritime security protects some of the world's busiest trade routes,"" Pompeo said in a streamed news conference after his meeting with Indonesia's foreign minister.
Retno said she wanted a ""stable and peaceful"" South China Sea where international law is respected.
Indonesia has repeatedly turned away Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels that have entered the North Natuna Sea.
Retno said Indonesia and the United States would enhance defence cooperation by boosting military procurement, training and exercises, intelligence sharing, and maritime security cooperation in the region. 
Although sharing the same position in opposing China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, Indonesian officials have expressed concern about Washington's strident anti-China policies and rhetoric alongside rising superpower tensions.
""I re-emphasized the need to pursue inclusive cooperation amidst this challenging time,"" Retno said. ""I underlined the need for every country to be part of the solution in the collective contribution towards world peace, stability and prosperity.""
This year, Indonesia rejected a U.S. request for landing and refuelling rights in Indonesia for its P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft that monitor China's military activity.
ECONOMIC COOPERATION
Retno said on Thursday she reminded Pompeo of the ""free and independent"" foreign policy of Southeast Asia's largest country and called for greater economic co-operation.
Indonesia's economic ties with China have increased at the same time Washington has considered downgrading Indonesia's preferential trade treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) facility.
That review is ongoing and Retno told Pompeo that the GSP facility was important to both nations.
""I encouraged U.S. businesses to invest more in Indonesia, including for projects in the outer islands of Indonesia, such as Natuna Island,"" Retno added.
Next month, senior government officials say Indonesia is expected to sign the world's biggest trade pact – the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership - that involves Southeast Asian states and China, but not the U.S.
Pompeo said he recognised the deficit in the economic relationship of the two countries, but made no commitment to retaining Indonesia's access to the GSP facility, which gives more than 3,500 Indonesian products duty-free status.
""There should be much more investment here from the United States, especially in the digital, energy and infrastructure sectors,"" Pompeo said.
Pompeo also met Indonesian President Joko Widodo, commonly known as Jokowi, on Thursday, and is scheduled to make an address to an Islamic youth group.
""President (Jokowi) emphasised that Indonesia wants economic cooperation between the two countries increasing in the future, including extension of GSP facilities for Indonesia,"" Retno said of Pompeo's meeting with the Indonesian leader. 
She added that the president urged Pompeo to ""understand Southeast Asia and Southeast Asian countries so as to create peace, stability and cooperation in the region"". 

Before his visit to Indonesia, Pompeo visited India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. He is scheduled to fly to Vietnam later on Thursday.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>","Analysis: With improved leverage, North Korea leader Kim awaits winner of U.S. vote","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's Kim Jong Un awaits the winner of next week's U.S. presidential election armed with greater leverage in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy, thanks to a more powerful and versatile arsenal of weapons than at the start of the Trump presidency.
While Donald Trump boasts of having prevented war and exchanged ""beautiful letters"" with Kim, the U.S. president has not wrested a single significant commitment from the North to roll back its weapons of mass destruction programme, according to Seoul officials and analysts. 
For Kim, Joe Biden poses a more challenging negotiating partner, more likely to pen a ""Dear Jong"" letter than engage with him in person - even though the bar for summit diplomacy is lower due to the precedent set by Trump, the officials say. 
Pyongyang embarked on an unprecedented series of weapons tests in 2017, declaring itself a nuclear power after undertaking its biggest nuclear blast and longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches.
After months of tightening sanctions and trading threats, Trump then became the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader at a summit in Singapore in 2018.
""Kim Jong Un has been doing what he needs to stay in power, and nuclear weapons are the most powerful means of survival,"" a South Korean official who is familiar with the diplomacy said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The official called it a ""Trump effect"" that Biden did not rule out a summit with Kim, even as the Democratic challenger called the North Korean leader a ""thug"" and said a meeting is possible only if Pyongyang rolls back its nuclear capability.
""Whoever wins the election, he has to solve the question of how to derive substantive denuclearisation under an agreed roadmap that clarifies an end state of the programmes,"" another Seoul official said. 
Although the North has largely kept to a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, it has continued to develop new missiles, as well as engines potentially designed for ICBMs and new mobile launchers, while building its nuclear weapons-grade stockpile, experts say.
'GAME CHANGERS'
While the United States' far greater military might could swiftly inflict critical damage on North Korea, Pyongyang now poses a threat with its nuclear missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland. 
Expert assessment of the North's new multiple rocket launchers and surface-to-surface missiles also rate them highly effective in any conflict on the peninsula.
Days after Kim's third meeting with Trump last year, the North offered a glimpse of a large submarine, believed to be capable of carrying multiple submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM). It was seen by military experts as another game changer, just as the Hwasong-15 ICBM launch in 2017 was.
A military parade https://www.reuters.com/video/?videoId=OVCZJVWBV&jwsource=em this month highlighted how the North has beefed up its strategic weapons. It featured a new SLBM and a previously unseen ICBM designed to carry multiple warheads - dubbed by experts as a ""monster"" and rolled out on an 11-axle transporter.
The display was intended to show Kim could take up negotiations where he had left off with Trump, or return to confrontation by resuming advanced weapons tests, said Lee Soo-seok, a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Strategy. 
""Nuclear development isn't something they can stop doing but if there was some kind of a deal, they might have adjusted its pace and gone more low-key, instead of showcasing the ICBM,"" Lee said. ""Trump might now be regretting not giving whatever half-baked deal and being unable to sell it as his legacy."" 
DUG-IN
Even as the coronavirus pandemic, border closure with China and recent typhoons add pressure to an economy already pummelled by international sanctions, Kim has dug in for a long battle. 
He has let unofficial markets thrive, allowing some breathing room for ordinary people to trade goods and securing funding sources for his pet projects. 
The young leader made rare, tearful confessions that he failed to tackle economic hardships in a speech at the recent military parade, but said ""time is on our side.""
""The longer negotiations drag on, the greater North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities grow, but Washington might think they hold the key through sanctions,"" said Koh Yu-hwan, president of the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. 

""Now stakes are higher for both sides, and the game would depend on who can hold out better in the face of threats they pose to each other.""

A parliamentary report released in July said the government failed to find out whether Russia meddled in the 2016 referendum on membership of the EU, and recommended the intelligence services investigate further. [nL5N2ES2X9]
Johnson's government immediately rejected that recommendation and said it had not been complacent over the ""enduring and significant threat"" posed by Russia. Russia denied any interference. 
The legal action launched on Thursday challenges Johnson's response and seeks a judicial review, claiming the government has breached the right to free elections enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.
""The sovereignty and security of our country, alongside the integrity of our democracy, is at stake, and this government’s wilfully turning a blind eye cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged,"" said Caroline Lucas, one of six lawmakers from parliament's upper and lower chambers named in the claim.

The grim discovery was made in the Salvatierra municipality of Guanajuato state, where the homicide rate has surged amid a raging turf war between rival drug cartels.
At least 10 of the corpses were women and most of the bodies belonged to very young people, even teenagers, according to Karla Quintana, head of Mexico's National Search Commission.
Alarm (NASDAQ:ALRM) raised by relatives of missing persons led to the largest discovery of clandestine graves in Guanajuato, she told a press conference on Wednesday afternoon.
""We have more possible positive developments, with which we will continue working here until we have finished the job,"" she said.
Guanajuato recorded 2,250 homicides between January and August of this year, according to official data, a more than 25% increase over the same period last year.

1541,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 07:18PM ET</span>",Philippines Paves Way to Ending Oil Exploration Row With China,"(Bloomberg) -- The Philippines has removed a major hurdle in advancing oil exploration with Beijing in the South China Sea, its top diplomat said, but the two nations will have to navigate their overlapping claims in the area to reach a deal.
President Rodrigo Duterte lifted a six-year ban on oil exploration in the South China Sea earlier this month to ensure that talks between Chinese and Philippine entities result in actual projects, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin said in an email to Bloomberg last week. China’s initial response to the move “has been very positive,” he added.
While the moratorium was imposed to “stop activities that might annoy China,” Locsin said that Duterte’s decision will not just benefit Beijing.
The Southeast Asian nation has recently toughened its stance against China and leaned back toward the U.S., which has also been stepping up its criticism of Beijing’s actions in the disputed waters. The end of the moratorium puts the ball in China’s court, and what it does next will indicate whether tensions with the Philippines ease or worsen.
In 2013, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that 4 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves worth billions of dollars could be found in South China Sea areas claimed by the Philippines and disputed by China. An international arbitration court ruled in favor of the Philippines in 2016, which Duterte recently raised before world leaders at the U.N.
“This is a universal lifting. No one is favored, and everyone is allowed depending on terms, over which I will keep an eagle eye and a ready pair of talons,” Locsin said.
Duterte’s decision to allow companies holding five service contracts including PXP Energy Corp. to resume drills was an exercise of the Philippines’ exclusive right in the area, presidential spokesman Harry Roque said at a briefing last week. “That exclusive right may be shared by others.”
‘Face-Saving Exit’
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has said Beijing is hoping to work together with Manila “for new progress in the joint development.”
The two nations could set aside the ownership issue and proceed with joint development, said Makoto Seta, a professor specializing in international law of the sea at Yokohama City University in Japan.
“The role of China National Offshore Oil Corp. would be important, since it has a strong tie with Beijing, but not a part of the Chinese government itself,” Seta said. The state-owned oil company is negotiating with a unit of PXP’s subsidiary on oil and gas development, and also has majority interest in another service contract held by the Philippine National Oil Company Exploration Corp.
PXP Energy is considering a survey of Reed Bank in the disputed waters, but is “not aware” if China’s permission will have to be secured, chairman Manuel Pangilinan told reporters Monday.
A commercial deal where CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) will become a sub-contractor or equity partner of a Philippine company is a “lucrative face-saving exit for China,” said Antonio Carpio, a former Philippine top court justice who defended the nation’s claims before the arbitration court. This will also be an “implied recognition” of Manila’s rights to the disputed areas, he added.
Others take a more pessimistic view.
The lifting of the moratorium “probably won’t matter,” as Beijing won’t allow a deal recognizing the Philippines’ sovereign rights, said Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative in Washington. He added that China will block any new exploration in contested waters, as shown in recent disputes with Vietnam and Malaysia.
Opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros said Duterte should not negotiate with China unless it recognizes the Philippines’ sovereign rights. “We’ve already won legally and diplomatically, and if the government itself cannot stand by this victory, China will only use this against us,” she said.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 07:02PM ET</span>",Philadelphia sets city-wide curfew to quell violent protests,"By Aleksandra Michalska
PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Philadelphia has imposed a city-wide curfew starting Wednesday at 9 p.m. to try to prevent a third night of looting and violence amid widespread protests over the police killing of a Black man.
The curfew will run through Thursday at 6 a.m., Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and other officials told a briefing.
Tension has gripped the streets of Philadelphia since Monday's deadly police shooting of Walter Wallace, 27, who was armed with a knife and described by relatives as suffering from a mental breakdown, in a confrontation with law enforcement.
Philadelphia police have made 172 arrests and 53 officers have been injured in two nights of protests that were marked by significant looting of big-box stores and other businesses, some of which were still recovering from unrest in the summer.
City officials said as many as 1,000 people were involved in looting in one corner of the city on Tuesday night, catching the police force off guard.
""These individuals are doing nothing but simply wasting our precious resources,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said at the briefing, lamenting what she described as ""widespread lawlessness"" in Pennsylvania's biggest city.
The unrest has turned Philadelphia into the latest flashpoint in the United States on issues of race and police use of force just days ahead of Tuesday's presidential election. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term in office, has made policing a top campaign issue, calling for a tough ""law and order"" stance on the protests. In Nevada on Wednesday, Trump said the events in Philadelphia were ""terrible"" and offered to send federal help.
""What I'm witnessing is terrible and frankly that the mayor or whoever it is that's allowing people to riot, and loot and not stopping them is also just a horrible thing,"" he said. 
Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground state in the race between Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden, who has said he supports the police but wants to address racial inequalities, among other issues.
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said on Wednesday his administration stood ready to help the city with the unrest, including to ""avoid unnecessary harm to businesses that provide services to affected neighborhoods.""
""We must address the systemic problems that cause tragedies against people of color,"" Wolf said on Twitter.
On Tuesday, Wolf ordered several hundred National Guard officers to prepare to assist Philadelphia. Mayor Kenney said the Guard would be brought in to ""safeguard property and prevent looting"" without providing a time frame. 
Tuesday's rallies began peacefully but grew confrontational as darkness fell, just as on the previous day. 
Police turned out in force to cordon off a West Philadelphia commercial district that was looted the previous night.
But looters broke into businesses elsewhere, including in the city's Port Richmond section, aerial news video from WPVI television showed. At times, police in riot gear shoved protesters back from barricade lines.
The violence erupted despite the pleading of the dead man's father, Walter Wallace Sr., who on Tuesday urged people to ""stop the violence"" out of respect for his son and family.
""I don't condone no violence, tearing up the city, looting of the stores, and all this chaos,"" he told reporters and a gathering of people. ""It's an SOS to help, not to hurt.""
He also called for justice in a case still being investigated.
The unrest in Philadelphia follows that in other cities where police have killed Black men.
Tensions have stayed high at demonstrations across the nation since the May 25 death of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes.

Outlaw said the city would release the bodycam footage and the 911 call records related to the shooting of Wallace after the family had been given a chance to review the materials.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight people have been charged with conspiring to work on China's behalf in a plot involving threatening letters and the use of night vision goggles to surveil and coerce a Chinese family to return to their home country to face charges, according to a U.S. criminal complaint unsealed on Wednesday. 
Five of the individuals charged, including an American private investigator hired to help spy on the family, were arrested on Wednesday in New Jersey, New York and California, while the rest are believed to be in China, top Justice Department officials said in a news conference.
The alleged plot was known as “Operation Fox Hunt” and “Operation Skynet,"" court records show, and it took place between 2016 and 2019. 
Its goal was to target Chinese nationals living in foreign countries and intimidate them into returning to China to face charges.
The United States does not have an extradition treaty with China. It does, however, require by law that anyone who is acting on a foreign country's behalf must register and notify the Attorney General's office.
All eight defendants in the case are charged with conspiring to act as illegal agents for a foreign government. 
A spokesman from the Chinese embassy did not have an immediate comment in response to the allegations.
""This is the first case of its kind, and I think it is significant,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Seth DuCharme. 
""What makes the case really stand out is that it directly involves the efforts of a foreign power to conduct unilateral activity here on U.S. soil, in violation of our laws.""
The criminal complaint alleges that the group plotted to target a former Chinese government employee and his wife and daughter, who have been living in New Jersey since 2010.
The alleged harassment the family endured included receiving a threatening note that read: “If you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right. That’s the end of this matter!”
The family also received threats on social media, as well as packages that contained letters along with taped video threats.
According to notices posted by China with Interpol in 2012 and 2014, China listed the New Jersey man as a fugitive who is wanted for embezzlement, abuse of power and accepting bribes.
Three of the defendants - Zhu Yong, Hongru Jin, and Michael McMahon - were arrested on Wednesday in New York and New Jersey.
A federal judge in New York on Wednesday ordered McMahon to be released on a $500,000 bond secured by a New Jersey property.
During the hearing, the judge declined a request by the goverment to detain Yong Zhu pending trial, and released him into the custody of his son on a $120,000 bond.
""I don't understand it because I didn't do anything that is illegal,"" Yong Zhu said through an interpreter. ""I was performing a legitimate profession as a driver.""
Two others - Rong Jing and Zheng Congying - were arrested in California. The last three defendants - Zhu Feng, Hu Ji, and Li Minjun - remain at large.
Reuters could not immediately determine who is representing the five people who were arrested.
According to his Linkedin profile, McMahon is a former New York Police Department sergeant who retired from the force in 2003. An attorney, he now works to help provide investigative support but could not be immediately reached for comment.
Also on Wednesday, the U.S. State Department announced it was designating a U.S. branch of a Chinese government-controlled organization as a foreign mission and withdrawing from an agreement to promote local-level cooperation between the countries.

The moves, announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,were the latest to curb Chinese activity in the United States in the run-up to next Tuesday's presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany does not believe that Thailand's king has so far breached its ban on conducting politics while staying there, a parliamentary source said on Wednesday, after lawmakers were briefed by the government.
Thai protesters asked Germany on Monday to look into whether King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 68, had conducted state business, such as the signing of royal commands and the annual expenditure act while he was on German soil.
Germany has said it would be unacceptable for the king to conduct politics there and Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the European power continued to look into his behaviour during sojourns in Bavaria.
Following a meeting of the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee, the source said the government had briefed lawmakers that it believes the king is permitted to make occasional decisions, as long as he does not continuously conduct business from German soil.
""The German government has taken the view that it is not yet of the opinion that the Thai king has continuously conducted business,"" the source said.
When asked about the status of the king, the government told the committee he has a visa that allows him to stay in Germany for several years as a private person and also enjoys diplomatic immunity as a head of state.
Thailand's political crisis has made the king's presence a challenge for Germany, but revoking the visa of a visiting head of state could cause a major diplomatic incident.
""It is very obvious that many find what the Thai king is doing very problematic, but the government says it is not yet the problem of continuous government business,"" the source said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Thousands took to the streets across Poland on Wednesday for the seventh day of protests against a court ruling that further limits the country's highly restrictive abortion laws.
Police warned demonstrators not to target churches again after some services were disrupted and buildings defaced in an earlier protest.
Poland has been rocked by huge demonstrations, most of them peaceful, since its top court ruled last Thursday that abortion due to foetal abnormalities was not permissible under the constitution.
The decision means only abortions due to incest, rape or a risk to the mother's health remain legal, setting predominantly Catholic Poland far apart from the European mainstream.
Demonstrators have blamed the nationalist government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the Roman Catholic Church which has close ties to the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party for the court verdict.
In a rare display of anger against the Church last Sunday, demonstrators in Warsaw, Poznan and Katowice disrupted church services and defaced church buildings. 
On Wednesday, organisers called for a nationwide walk-out for women at work. Some employers, including schools, announced a day off to allow people to join the protests.
Chanting ""hypocrites, fanatics"", thousands marched through central Warsaw, some carrying posters that read ""Revolution is a woman"" and ""I'd rather stay home but I have a government to overthrow"".
""In light of plans being announced by organisers for further acts of aggression and profanation, the police will take decisive action. The goal of the police is to ensure public order and safety for all citizens,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
It was not clear which group or plans the ministry was referring to. A mass demonstration is planned in Warsaw on Friday.
WAITING FOR PUBLICATION
The government denies influencing the court but the ruling follows five years of PiS efforts to instil more conservative values in public life in close cooperation with the Catholic Church. It also comes after sweeping judiciary reforms the European Commission says have politicised courts and undermined democratic norms.
More than 70% of Poles say they oppose the ruling, according to a survey published by the liberal Gazeta Wyborcza daily.
Kamila Kobrynska, 35, who runs a professional training school for adults in Warsaw, joined businesses across Poland in closing up shop on Wednesday.
""We won't go bankrupt in one day. This issue is so important, there is no discussion whether we work or protest.""
Supporters of the government were eager for the decision to be implemented. An anti-abortion campaign group, Ordo Iuris, called for its inclusion in the official gazette so that it goes into effect.

""We believe that every day of delay is a day that we lose another child's life because of suspected flaws or genetic diseases,"" said director Karolina Pawlowska.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - A Malian court handed a death sentence to a suspected jihadist and his co-defendant on Wednesday, his lawyer said, after he pleaded guilty to shooting five people to death in a 2015 attack and planning two other attacks targeting Westerners that killed 37.
In a court appearance in Bamako on Wednesday, Fawaz Ould Ahmed described in detail how he carried out the attack on La Terrace restaurant in March 2015.
He said he was also involved in planning a raid that killed 17 at Hotel Byblos in the town of Sevare in August and another that killed 20 people at Bamako's Radisson Blu hotel that November.
The attacks marked a brazen new phase in jihadist operations across West Africa, in which top hotels and tourist destinations frequented by Western tourists, aid workers and diplomats were no longer considered safe. 
""I regret nothing,"" Ould Ahmed told the court, adding that he had been seeking revenge for cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad printed in the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
The court later found him and his co-defendant guilty and sentenced both to death, Ould Ahmed's lawyer Tiessolo Konare told Reuters, vowing to appeal the ruling.
In January 2015, two months before Ould Ahmed's first attack, Islamist militants in Paris had stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo and shot dead 12 people because of the cartoons. 
Ould Ahmed described taking a taxi to La Terrasse restaurant and carrying out the shooting.
""On arrival I went to the toilets, put on a balaclava, took out my Kalashnikov and shot those unbelievers,"" he said.
At the time, militant groups Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and al Mourabitoun claimed responsibility for the attacks in Mali as well as for attacks on a restaurant in neighbouring Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou and a beach resort town in Ivory Coast. 

Ould Ahmed was captured in Bamako in 2016 as he was preparing to carry out another attack armed with grenades and a suitcase filled with weapons on behalf of al Mourabitoun, according to local authorities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday unsealed an indictment charging Haji Najibullah, an Afghanistan national, with six counts related to the 2008 kidnapping of an American journalist and two Afghan nationals.
The department added that Najibullah, 44, was arrested and transferred to the United States from Ukraine where he will face trial.
The indictment does not name the journalist, but a law enforcement official familiar with the matter told Reuters the case involves David Rohde, a former Reuters and New York Times correspondent now with the New Yorker who was kidnapped by the Taliban in 2008. 
Najibullah is facing charges, including hostage taking, conspiracy to commit hostage taking, kidnapping, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and two counts of using and possessing a machinegun in furtherance of crimes of violence.
Mark Gombiner, a Manhattan-based federal public defender listed in court records as Najibullah's lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. David Rohde also did not respond to a request for comment.
The indictment says that in November 2008, Najibullah ""caused"" a group of men carrying machine-guns to detain the Rohde and two Afghans who were helping him. Later, the indictment says, Najibullah and around six armed guards forced the journalist and the Afghans to hike across the border from Afghanistan into Pakistan.
The indictment says that in April 2009, while in Pakistan, Najibullah recorded a videos of the journalist begging for help while a machine-gun was pointed at his face.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other of killing civilians by shelling cities in and around Nagorno-Karabakh on Wednesday, in an escalation of a month-long conflict over the mountain enclave that has defied three ceasefires.
Azerbaijan said 21 people were killed when Armenian shells hit the town of Barda, northeast of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian-backed officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri shells had fallen on the enclave's two largest cities, killing one person.
Both sides denied each other's claims.
The worst fighting in the South Caucasus for nearly 30 years has raised fears of a wider war that could suck in Russia and Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan. It also poses a threat to pipelines carrying oil and gas from Azerbaijan to world markets.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had witnessed shelling in urban areas on both sides of the front line. It said a volunteer from the Azerbaijan Red Crescent Society had been killed and two others injured in the shelling.
""These latest exchanges signal that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict risks spiralling out of control,"" Martin Schuepp, the ICRC's Eurasia regional director, said in a statement. ""Civilian lives are being lost at an alarming rate.""
Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war in the region.
The prosecutor general of Azerbaijan's office said 21 people had been killed and 70 wounded in Barda.
Aisel Huseynova, a 35-year-old housewife who lives in the town, said she heard two explosions while out shopping with her son. The second blast swept her off her feet.
""When I regained consciousness, I was already in the ambulance,"" she said by telephone from a hospital bed. ""I have a wound in the leg and arm. My son was not with me. I don't know where he is.""
The Emergency and Rescue Service of ethnic Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh said shells had fallen on Stepanakert, the enclave's largest city. It said a civilian had been killed and two wounded by shelling in another city, Shushi, 15 km (nine miles) to the south.
Armenia's defence ministry also said a maternity hospital in Stepanakert had been hit. There were no reports of casualties.
Angela Frangyan, a documentary film maker currently in Stepanakert, said she heard ""at least two strong bombardments"".
""When I approached the hospital, I saw shattered windows and damaged ceilings at the maternity hospital, and a doctor crying,"" she told Reuters by telephone.
BROKEN CEASEFIRES
Armenia's defence ministry also confirmed on Wednesday that Azerbaijan had seized the strategic town of Gubadli between the enclave and the Iranian border, an apparent military gain that could make a diplomatic solution more difficult.
Azerbaijan rejects any solution that would leave Armenians in control of the enclave, which it considers to be illegally occupied. Armenia regards the territory as part of its historic homeland and says the population there needs its protection.
The Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry has recorded 1,068 military deaths since fighting erupted on Sept. 27. Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military casualties. Russia has estimated as many as 5,000 deaths in total.
The latest of three ceasefires was brokered in Washington on Sunday. U.S. President Donald Trump called the renewed fighting ""disappointing"" and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged both sides to pursue a diplomatic solution.

The OSCE Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, was due to meet the Azeri and Armenian foreign ministers in Geneva on Thursday but this has not been confirmed. Turkey has demanded a bigger role in the group.

(Reuters) - A former spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was sentenced on Wednesday to seven years in prison for defrauding at least a dozen companies of over $4.4 million by falsely claiming to be an undercover Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative.
Prosecutors said Garrison Courtney, 44, of Florida, falsely claimed to be a CIA spy working with a secret ""task force"" involving multiple US defense and spy agencies. In reality, he had never worked for the CIA and the task force he described did not exist, prosecutors said.
Stuart Sears, a lawyer for Courtney, told Reuters: ""While there are many explanations for what Mr. Courtney did, he has offered no excuses.  He has a long history of service to his country and I expect that, upon his release from prison, he will once again be a law-abiding and contributing member of society."" 
Prosecutors said Courtney falsely claimed he had served in the U.S. Army during the Gulf War, had hundreds of confirmed kills in combat and that a hostile foreign intelligence service attempted to poison him with ricin. 
Prosecutors said Courtney told private companies they had to hire him to create what Courtney described as ""commercial covers"" to disguise his claimed CIA link. 
They said Courtney told companies who hired him they would be reimbursed for payments to him, and that such repayments could come in the form of government contracts related to a non-existent secret program.
To convince potential targets that he was legitimate, prosecutors said, Courtney sometimes threatened people who questioned his legitimacy with security clearance revocations and criminal prosecution if they ""leaked"" supposedly classified information. 
Prosecutors said Courtney created fake letters, supposedly issued by the U.S. Attorney General, purporting to grant blanket immunity to participants in his scheme.
At today's sentencing hearing, Courtney apologized for his crimes, for victimizing so many people, and hurting his family.

""Yesterday, the Amuay refinery - one of the most important refineries in Venezuela and Latin America - was attacked with a long, powerful weapon,"" Maduro said at a press conference, adding that the government was seeking to determine what kind of weapon was involved. 
The OPEC nation's once-formidable 1.3 million bpd refining network is mostly halted due to years of underinvestment and mismanagement, contributing this year to acute fuel shortages across Venezuela. 
Maduro said the country's refineries were producing around 30% more fuel than internal demand levels, without providing details of which plants were operating. He added that Venezuela had imported fuel both from Iran and other countries, without specifying which others. 
The reformer unit at the 310,000 bpd Cardon refinery is currently producing gasoline, according to two people familiar with the matter, but most other gasoline-producing plants in Venezuela are down. 

The government has frequently blamed Venezuela's opposition and the United States for alleged attacks on the country's critical infrastructure, including after widespread electricity blackouts last year. The opposition dismisses those accusations as excuses for the failure of Venezuela's public services.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A U.S. citizen sentenced last year to 12 years in a Vietnamese jail for ""attempting to overthrow the state"" spoke of his 27-month detention at a Zoom news conference on Wednesday, after he was released and returned to his home in California last week.
Michael Nguyen, who was born in Vietnam in 1964 and lived in the United States since childhood, was detained in July 2018 on suspicion of anti-government activities, including alleged incitement of protesters to attack government offices with Molotov cocktails and slingshots, state media reported at the time.
""I was essentially kidnapped, myself and three others, taken off a bus,"" Nguyen, the father of four daughters, said of his detention. ""No reason was given to me. No credentials were presented to me. I was blindfolded, handcuffed and put into a car by people in civilian clothes.""
He said he was interrogated ""for 16 hours at a time for days.""
His trial came nearly a year after his capture, during which time he had no access to a lawyer, Nguyen said. The day before the trial he was provided a public defender ""who was given a stack of paper more than 12 inches tall."" 
""They had written out a statement for me to sign and the public defender's main job was to get me to sign a statement of words that were not even my own,"" Nguyen said.
When he tried to speak, he was stopped in court. ""They silenced me,"" he said.
GUEST OF TRUMP
Nguyen's wife, Helen, attended U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech last year as a guest of U.S. Representative Katie Porter, a California Democrat who hosted the Zoom news conference. 
His release comes ahead of Vietnam's announcement this week that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will visit Vietnam on Thursday and Friday as part of a tour of Asia.
Hanoi said Pompeo's visit will mark the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, who fought a long war in the 1960s and '70s that badly divided the United States.
Vietnam released Nguyen on ""humanitarian grounds"" last Wednesday and he was initially flown to South Korea where he made contact with his family, Porter told the news conference.
Nguyen was convicted under ""a broad statute"" concerning the overthrow of the state, Porter said.
Nguyen declined to disclose further details of his imprisonment and release at Thu Duc Prison, saying it could affect the cases of other foreigners who remain jailed in Vietnam. 
Vietnam has previously freed imprisoned political activists before the end of their sentences, provided they permanently leave the country.
Nguyen's release was not reported in Vietnam's state media.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's president said on Wednesday that Western countries mocking Islam wanted to ""relaunch the Crusades"", heightening a confrontation with France over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad that have stirred anger in Muslim-majority countries.
In a speech to lawmakers of his AK Party in parliament, President Tayyip Erdogan said that standing against attacks on the Prophet was ""an issue of honour for us"", suggesting Ankara may be digging in for a prolonged standoff.
The row with France flared after a French teacher who showed pupils cartoons of the Prophet published in the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo was beheaded in France this month. The caricatures are considered blasphemous by Muslims.
In a sign of spreading anger at France's defence of the right to publish the cartoons, demonstrators denounced France in street protests in several Muslim-majority countries.
""France down, it insulted our Prophet,"" protesters shouted in the Somali capital Mogadishu.
Furthering Turkish anger, Charlie Hebdo published a cartoon on its cover showing Erdogan sitting in a white t-shirt and underpants, holding a canned drink and lifting the skirt of a woman wearing an Islamic hijab to reveal her naked bottom.
Turkish officials said Ankara would take legal and diplomatic steps in response to the caricature, calling it a ""disgusting effort"" to ""spread its cultural racism and hatred"".
The Turkish foreign ministry summoned the charge d'affaires at the French embassy over the magazine cover.
Erdogan said he had not seen the caricature ""because I consider it wrong to even look at these immoral publications"" and that his anger was over disrespect towards the Prophet rather than the ""disgusting attack directed at me"". 
The West was ""once again headed to a period of barbarity"", he said, describing colonial powers as ""murderers"" for their record in Africa and the Middle East.
""They literally want to relaunch the Crusades. Since the Crusades, the seeds of evil and hatred have started falling on these (Muslim) lands and that's when peace was disrupted.""
The French government, backed by many citizens, saw the Oct. 16 knife attack - in which a man of Chechen origin beheaded Samuel Paty, a teacher who had shown pupils cartoons of the Prophet in a civics lesson - as an attack on freedom of speech.
Macron has said he would redouble efforts to stop conservative Islamic beliefs subverting French values.
Turkish state media said Turkish prosecutors had launched an investigation into Charlie Hebdo's executives. Turkey's Communications Directorate said the battle against ""these rude, ill-intentioned and insulting steps"" would continue to the end.
PROTESTS WIDEN TO SOMALIA, MALI
Erdogan sharply criticised Macron at the weekend, saying the French leader needed a mental health check, prompting France to recall its ambassador from Ankara. On Monday, Erdogan urged a boycott of French products.
France's foreign ministry on Tuesday issued safety advice to French citizens in Indonesia, Turkey, Bangladesh, Iraq and Mauritania, advising them to exercise caution. They were told to stay away from any protests over the cartoons and avoid any public gatherings.
In Cairo, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said freedom of expression should stop if it offended more than 1.5 billion people.
The Grand Imam of Egypt's al-Azhar university, one of the world's most eminent seats of Sunni Muslim learning, urged the international community to criminalise ""anti-Muslim"" actions.
In the Somali capital Mogadishu, hundreds of mostly youthful demonstrators gathered at a busy junction leading to the airport, chanting anti-French slogans and burning French flags. They were responding to calls by clerics to come out and condemn France and boycott French products.
""We are going to use our muscles to defend Islam,"" a middle-aged man, Mohamed Ahmed, who was at the demonstration, told Reuters when asked why he was participating. ""We ask people to burn every product of France they come across.""
Dozens of Iranians gathered in protest in front of the French embassy in Tehran, state media reported. Some held up placards with red crosses plastered on images of French goods.
In Dhaka, hundreds of Bangladeshi Muslims took to the streets of the capital for a third consecutive day, chanting slogans such as ""Boycott French products"" and burning effigies of Macron, whom they described as an enemy of Islam.

At a much larger protest on Tuesday in Dhaka, thousands had turned out for a protest carrying banners such as ""Stop Islamophobia"", ""Boycott France"" and ""Lay siege to the French Embassy in Dhaka"".

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will allow non-members such as Britain and the United States to take part in future joint EU defence projects, but only on an exceptional basis, three EU diplomats said on Wednesday.
The decision resolves a long saga over whether Britain, which has left the bloc, could take part in a new EU defence pact, known as Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), which aims to help the EU fund, develop and deploy armed forces together. It will not amount to an EU military.
The breakthrough of an impasse which dates back to June 2018 also helps to revive EU defence integration efforts launched with great fanfare in December 2017, in part to show unity after Brexit, but which ran into bureaucratic hurdles.
In May this year, the European Commission made a long-awaited proposal to earmark 8 billion euros ($9.5 billion) of its next budget on a new, complementary EU defence fund, keeping alive a Franco-German desire to deepen military cooperation among EU nations that have long pursued independent projects.
While the United States, the world's biggest military power, has 30 weapons systems, the EU has 178. The bloc has 17 types of battle tank, compared to just one in the United States.
""The rules on participation of non-members was the last missing piece of the puzzle,"" a senior EU diplomat said of Wednesday's decision, which will allow Britain and others, such as Norway and the United States, to take part in future projects to develop aircraft, helicopters and weapons.
Non-member participants will only be able to come in on individual projects and must bring substantial know-how, diplomats said. The decision does not affect U.S. defence contractors' traditional access to bid for individual European military contracts in the EU. 
However, Turkey, a NATO member and candidate to join the EU, is unlikely to be able to take part because of requirements in the EU defence pact that call for non members to ""support and uphold European values"", a second diplomat said.
The Commission this month said Turkey was undermining its economy, eroding democracy and destroying independent courts, leaving its bid to join the EU further away than ever.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania's new government will have more women than ever, election winner Ingrida Simonyte said on Wednesday, in a bid to change traditional gender attitudes in the Baltic Sea state.
Simonyte's Homeland Union party, the centre-right main opposition party with roots in the 1980s anti-Soviet independence movement, is crafting the next government with two liberal parties, both headed by women.
The coalition won 74 seats in the 141-seat parliament on Sunday.
The country of fewer than 3 million people has fared relatively well in the coronavirus crisis, though cases have spiked of late as elsewhere around Europe. But outgoing Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis has faced criticism for failing to create more jobs and stop debt mounting.
Last year, Skvernelis presided over one of the few European male-only cabinets, something Simonyte hopes to change with having five or more females in the next 15-member lineup.
""I want to show, by example of myself and my female colleagues, that not only men can be at the top, but also women,"" Simonyte told Reuters in an interview.
""A lot of our society is defined from the traditional upbringing, which tells girls to be nurses or teachers, while boys are set to become leaders and decision makers,"" she added. ""These things are slow to change on their own.""
Simonyte was finance minister in a previous Homeland Union government, which lost power in 2012 after one of Europe's harshest austerity programmes, which caused a collapse in GDP of about 15% in 2009.
But she says she won't resort to austerity if the coronavirus cripples the economy again.
""In 2009, we had our own currency, risked a devaluation and no one would lend to us, so we needed the cuts. Now we have the euro and the favourable monetary policy, and thank God for that,"" she said.
Simonyte said her government will continue to work for a tougher EU response to Belarus crisis.
Lithuania gave refuge to the opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya as she fled crackdowns after the disputed Aug. 9 election which President Alexander Lukashenko said he won.
""Some European leaders say that we need to talk to the Kremlin, that Belarus is its sphere of influence. We, and Poland, see things differently,"" said Simonyte.

""I don't think that European Union sees Belarus as part of its interests. I think that it should.""

The break-ins at a museum in Beek in August and Ossendrecht in the southern Netherlands two weeks ago prompted a nationwide security review of World War Two museums, said Janneke Kennis, who works at a similar museum in Overloon.
""We don't think they were stolen to sell openly online, because the weapons are numbered and are so unique and rare that they would immediately be recognised,"" Kennis said.
The thieves were well prepared and appeared to have taken items ordered for private collections, she said.
""They probably scouted the museums to see what they needed to break in, made a list and carried it out very professionally,"" she said.
At the Eyewitness War Museum in Beek, several vehicles were used in August to get away with the most valuable parts of the collection, estimated to be worth around 1.5 million euros, after burglars forced the gates and rammed the front door.
Years in the making, the collection of 150 costumed characters displayed in dioramas told the story of a German parachutist named August Segel.
At the Ossendrecht museum, thieves cleared out nearly the entire collection, including hundreds of thousands of euros worth of SS uniforms, daggers, helmets, emblems, caps, parachutes, firearms and binoculars.
The Overloon museum has since returned to their owners a number of pieces that were on loan, including a one-of-a-kind list of 1,500 victims of the Auschwitz death camp, because they were considered too valuable to keep on public display given the recent break-ins.

President Donald Trump's administration said last week it was enacting a rule prohibiting persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction from sending remittances to Communist-run Cuba via firms that work with Cuban military-controlled companies. 
Military-owned Fincimex is the main Cuban partner of Western Union, which millions of Cubans in the United States have used for two decades to send money back to their loved ones on the Caribbean island.
In a statement published on Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the military used its profits from the transfer business ""to oppress the Cuban people and to fund Cuba's interference in Venezuela"".
Some analysts also believe the Trump administration is ratcheting up sanctions on Cuba ahead of next week's presidential election in a bid to ensure it has secured the anti-Castro vote in the key swing state of Florida. 
The administration said the changes would be effective within 30 days, theoretically giving Western Union and the Cuban government time to figure out a new business arrangement such as transferring the remittances business to non-military entities.
""We are exploring ways to comply with the new rules and regulations on Cuba,"" Western Union said in a statement.
""We will provide additional information as we formalize those plans. In the meantime, Western Union services between the U.S. and Cuba remain operational."" 
But a Fincimex statement posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and shared on social media by the Cuban Foreign Ministry suggests Havana will not negotiate. 
""Fincimex is the entity that, by sovereign decision of the Cuban government, has been charged with guaranteeing remittances to Cuba from the United States, which will now be totally interrupted,"" it said.

Students, factory workers and pensioners have taken to the streets since Monday, part of a protest action called for by exiled opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya who hopes economic disruption will compel Lukashenko to step down. 
She has accused him of rigging an August presidential election which she says she won and demanded he step aside and allow new elections to be held. 
Lukashenko has insisted his election victory was legitimate and used force to crack down on protesters. 
Many student protesters discovered on Wednesday that they had been expelled for defying him.
At least 15 students from a medical university in Minsk were expelled after taking part in the strike, one student told Reuters on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals.
Another 18 students from the Belarusian State University of Culture and Arts found their entry passes had been blocked, after which they were informed that they had been kicked out, a student group wrote on its Telegram channel. 
The expulsions came a day after Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, said students who broke the law would be punished. 
""Those who violated the law at unsanctioned protests lose the right to be students,"" he said. ""Please send them to the army or (throw them) on to the streets.""
In one case, police detained a 21-year-old student for allegedly barging into a classroom at a university in Minsk and calling on fellow students to join the strike, the Interior Ministry and Prosecutor General's Office said.
He could face up to three years in prison. 
In the city of Vitebsk, northeast of the capital Minsk, students made a video appeal to the authorities, calling for Lukashenko to step down and for violence against demonstrators to stop. 
""Many students from Belarus are now facing pressure from the administration of educational institutions for peacefully expressing their opinion,"" Maria, a third-year veterinary student, said in the video published on Wednesday. 
""This is done in different ways. With the riot police, detentions, threats of been barred from taking exams and tests.""
At one Minsk university specialising in linguistics, at least 30 professors joined their students in the strike, one of the professors told Reuters.

Weeks of political dispute have delayed a deal on a new cabinet that must tackle a crippling financial meltdown - the worst crisis since a 1975-1990 civil war.
Veteran Sunni politician Saad al-Hariri was named premier for a fourth time last week, pledging to swiftly form a new cabinet which must then address a long list of problems. 
Hariri stepped down a year ago as the crisis erupted and huge protests against the political elite swept the country. The currency has since collapsed, banks are paralysed and the state has defaulted on its hefty foreign currency debt.
A new government will have to agree a financial recovery plan, resume talks with the International Monetary Fund and enact overdue reforms to trigger foreign cash Lebanon badly needs. Otherwise, donors have made clear, there will be no aid.
The country is also grappling with a COVID-19 surge and the fallout of the August explosion at Beirut port that killed nearly 200 people and caused billions of dollars of damage.
Hariri has presented himself as the candidate to build a cabinet to implement a roadmap by former colonial ruler France which sought to rally Lebanese leaders to tackle the crisis. 

""The coming government could see the light within four or five days if the positive atmosphere continues on the current track,"" the office of Shi'ite leader Berri, whose Amal party is allied with Iran-backed Hezbollah, quoted him as saying.

Mustapha Derar, an Algerian national, was arrested in Tlemcen after security forces tracked him from his crossing of the border into Algeria, the ministry said in a statement. Derar had joined a terrorist group in 2012, it added. 
Mali, grappling with an Islamist insurrection, released scores of prisoners including suspected militants early this month, days before jihadists freed four hostages: a Malian politician, a French aid worker and two Italians.
Malian authorities have neither confirmed nor denied that militants were released in exchange for Soumaila Cisse, Sophie Petronin, Pierluigi Maccalli and Nicola Chiacchio.
Algeria defeated its own Islamist insurgency in the 1990s in a civil war that killed 200,000 people. Its defence ministry said Mali's release of militants was ""impeding efforts to combat terrorism"". 
Both al Qaeda and the Islamic State groups have taken advantage of local conflicts to establish a presence across the Sahara and the Sahel region to its south. 
Of particular concern for Algeria are two of its neighbours: Mali, where Islamists took advantage of an earlier insurgency by Tuareg separatists; and Libya, where Islamic State established a presence in the chaos following the NATO-backed uprising that ousted Muammar Gaddafi. 
In 2013 a group of al Qaeda-linked militants stormed an Algerian gas production facility deep in the Sahara, demanding the end of French military operations against jihadists in Mali. Dozens were killed in the attack including the militants. 
Changes to Algeria's constitution, which will be put to a referendum on Sunday, would allow its powerful army to intervene beyond the country's borders.

The source said any deal aimed at creating a ""shared prosperity zone"" in Gibraltar, a British territory over which Spain claims sovereignty, was unlikely before a full Brexit agreement. 
That broader deal remains uncertain just two months before Britain's post-Brexit transition period ends.
""We've made our suggestions, explored technical solutions on how to get there. What is lacking is the political will to close the deal. The ball is in the United Kingdom's court,"" the source said on Wednesday.
Failure to reach a side deal on Gibraltar would carry a heavy social, economic and political cost, the source said.
The British Foreign Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Gibraltar has welcomed Spain's ""pragmatism"" on its key demand that their mutual border remain fully open, and the source expressed hope that that spirit would ultimately prevail.
About 15,000 people commute daily from Spain to Gibraltar, which has a population of 32,000. 
The port at the northern tip of the Mediterranean, which Spain ceded to Britain in 1713 after a war, also welcomes some 10 million tourists per year, a sector accounting for about a quarter of its economy.
Spain has agreed to put the issue of its sovereignty claim to one side to focus on the opportunity to keep the border with Gibraltar open.

The Southeast Asian nation was among several Muslim-majority countries that have denounced remarks by French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron, defending the display of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a French school classroom. The caricatures are seen as blasphemous by Muslims.
In its meeting with French charge d'affaires Gilles Barrier, the ministry strongly condemned ""any inflammatory rhetoric and provocative acts that seek to defame the religion of Islam"", it said in a statement. 
""Malaysia is of the view that such elevated tension does not bode well for the peaceful co-existence of all religions.""
Malaysia was committed to upholding freedom of speech and expression ""as long as these rights are exercised with respect and responsibility in order to not infringe on or violate the rights of others"", Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in a separate statement. 
""In this context, to denigrate and tarnish Islam’s Holy Prophet and to associate Islam with terrorism are certainly beyond the scope of such rights."" 
Representatives from parties in Malaysia's ruling coalition, the United Malays National Organisation and Islamist party PAS, have also submitted memorandums of protest to the French Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. 
In a statement, the embassy defended Macron's remarks, saying they were not aimed at the Muslim community at large but at the ideology of ""radical Islamism"".
The dispute flared after a French teacher who, during a civics lesson, showed his pupils cartoons of the Prophet published in the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo was beheaded in the street by an attacker of Chechen origin.
French officials said the beheading was an attack on the core French value of freedom of expression and defended the right to publish the cartoons.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) are riding high in opinion polls but their popularity masks serious unease among senior party officials about damaging internal divisions triggered by a delay in voting for a new leader.
A decision by the CDU top brass on Monday to postpone a Dec. 4 party congress to choose a new leader has stoked internal divisions, with one candidate - Friedrich Merz - saying elements of the CDU establishment don't want him to get the job.
The upshot is the CDU faces a bitter leadership battle that risks dragging on until the spring at least, when the new leader will only have a brief period to emerge from Merkel's shadow. 
Top CDU officials, who said they delayed the congress due to the coronavirus pandemic, are worried about party cohesion and discipline - usually a strength - going into election year 2021.
""Some are worried that a defeated (leadership) candidate will not be able to rest easy after the election,"" said one top party official, adding that Merz had strengthened these fears by crying foul over the postponement of the party congress.
At stake is the leadership of Europe's biggest economy in the era after Merkel, who has vowed not to run again at elections due next autumn after looming large on the European stage since 2005 and proving a winner with German voters.
An INSA poll for Bild newspaper released on Tuesday put support for Merkel's conservative alliance of the CDU and its Bavarian CSU sister party on 35.5%, far ahead of the Greens in second place on 17.5% and the Social Democrats (SPD) on 14.5%.
The CDU's popularity has been boosted by Merkel's competent handling of the pandemic, with far lower infection rates in Germany than in neighbouring countries.
But outgoing CDU chairwoman Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has warned the party's three leadership candidates - Merz, Armin Laschet and Norbert Roettgen - against ""ruinous competition"" after a new leader is elected, party officials say.
NASTY AND PERSONAL
The rivalry is already getting nasty and personal. 
Merz told Reuters Monday's decision by the executive committee to postpone the congress was ""against the party base"".
He also told the newspaper Die Welt he had ""clear indications"" that Laschet ""got out the message that he needs more time to improve his performance"". 
Michael von Abercon, a Merz ally and CDU lawmaker, said efforts by Laschet supporters to dismiss as ""conspiracy theories"" the idea that the CDU party establishment doesn't want Merz as leader show how ""raw their nerves are"".
The CDU's executive committee - and Laschet - insist that the pandemic means it would be inappropriate for the party's 1,001 delegates to hold their congress as planned in Stuttgart on Dec. 4.
Opinion polls show Merz is more popular with CDU members than Laschet, who is premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Roettgen, a foreign policy expert. But the party elite, to whom the delegates are close, favour Laschet.
The German constitution allows parties to hold online meetings but votes to elect officials must be in person.
This could be done by a postal vote, but as none of the three CDU leadership candidates is likely to win outright in the first round, a second vote would likely be needed - meaning this option would be protracted.
""You're not going to avoid holding a normal party congress,"" said one CDU official. ""Everything else is difficult.""
Rising infection rates mean a regular CDU congress might not be possible until well into next year. Germany must hold its next federal election by Oct. 24, 2021 at the latest.
The left-leaning SPD has already picked Olaf Scholz, who is finance minister in Merkel's grand coalition, as its chancellor candidate. The SPD does not want to renew the awkward right-left ruling alliance.
""Unlike the SPD, the Christian Democrats believe in getting and keeping power,"" said Josef Joffe, editor-publisher of weekly Die Zeit. ""Hence, they maintain discipline like a good army.""

He said postponing the congress would have unpredictable consequences but ""if Germany restores public health and growth, the next chancellor will hail from the CDU/CSU"".

With Tuesday's U.S. election approaching, President Donald Trump's move was praised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and could resonate with evangelical Christian voters who support Israeli settlement in the West Bank.
The West Bank settlement of Ariel, the site of an Israeli university, was chosen as the venue for a ceremony opening a new avenue of U.S. scientific cooperation with Israeli researchers.
Palestinians, who seek the West Bank for a future state, said the move made Washington complicit in what they termed Israel's illegal settlement enterprise.
In Ariel, Netanyahu and David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, revised three agreements reached between 1972 and 1977, enabling researchers in settlements to apply for U.S. government funds. They also signed a new scientific and technology cooperation accord.
Under the now-lifted prohibition, research money for Israelis could not be distributed in areas such as the West Bank that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view permanent settlements on such land as a violation of the Geneva Conventions, though Israel disputes this.
""The Trump vision ... opens Judea and Samaria to academic, commercial and scientific engagement with the United States,"" Netanyahu said at the ceremony in Ariel, using biblical names for West Bank territory.
""This is an important victory against all those who seek to delegitimise everything Israeli beyond the 1967 lines.""
Friedman said $1.4 billion had been invested by three U.S.-Israeli research cooperation funds since 1972.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said lifting of the funding ban represented ""American participation in the occupation of Palestinian lands"".
The Trump administration last year effectively backed Israel's right to build West Bank settlements by abandoning a long-held U.S. position that they were ""inconsistent with international law"".

At the ceremony, Netanyahu again praised Trump for his ""successful approach to bringing peace to our region"", citing U.S.-brokered deals for diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states.

But when he speaks, he addresses Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in a firm, clear voice. In his left hand, he holds a red and white flag, the symbol of the protest movement against the veteran president.
""You must announce your departure, you must halt violence and you must release all political prisoners,"" says the young factory worker, who gives his name as Viktor Mankevich.
A video https://twitter.com/HannaLiubakova/status/1321398280933253120 posted on Twitter on Wednesday shows Mankevich making his lonely protest after climbing a ladder to reach a narrow platform near the top of a factory chimney. 
""Don't destroy our country. If you have anything human about you, if you really care about Belarus, then go. Go now, before it's too late,"" he tells Lukashenko.
Shortly afterwards, he was arrested by police, according to the news website Tut.By, quoting colleagues.
An interior ministry spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.
The desperate protest gesture comes at a critical moment for the opposition movement, which accuses Lukashenko of rigging a presidential election on Aug. 9 and had given him until last Sunday night to resign or face a national strike.
The three-day-old strike has so far failed to paralyse the country as the opposition had threatened. Its leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has said the strike movement is growing, but that it faces ""colossal pressure"" from the authorities.

PARIS (Reuters) - France is preparing this week to order people to stay in their homes except for essential journeys, work, or exercise, in a fresh attempt to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, according to two industry sources familiar with the government's planning.
French President Emmanuel Macron is due to make a televised address on COVID-19 measures at 8:00 pm (1900 GMT) on Wednesday. A government official refused to detail the measures, beyond saying there would be new steps.
The industry sources said that the new restrictions would be nationwide, and similar in scope to a lockdown that was enforced in spring this year, when hospitalisations and deaths caused by the virus reached a peak.
Under that lockdown, people were allowed out for essential work, to seek medical care, to buy essential goods, or for one hour of exercise daily.
However, in a departure from the spring lockdown, the government is planning to keep most schools open, according to the sources.
Under the plan described by the sources, non-essential shops will close, with supermarkets and pharmacies among the outlets allowed to stay open. People will be able to go to work if they cannot do their job remotely.

The new arrangement will be of finite duration but it was not clear exactly how long it would last, according to the sources.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>",Trump administration sets record low limit for new U.S. refugees,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration has slashed the number of refugees it will allow to resettle in the United States in the coming year, capping the number at 15,000, a record low in the history of the country's modern refugee program.
President Donald Trump finalized his plan in a memo overnight and said the ceiling for fiscal 2021, which started this month, includes 6,000 unused placements from last year ""that might have been used if not for the COVID-19 pandemic.""
The Republican president, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, has taken a hard line toward legal and illegal immigration, including sharply curbing refugee admissions every year since taking office in 2017.
In his statement, Trump said any new refugees this year should be placed by the U.S. State Department in parts of the country open to hosting them. 
""Newly admitted refugees should be placed, to the maximum extent possible, in States and localities that have clearly expressed their willingness to receive refugees"" and ""resettled in communities that are eager and equipped to support their successful integration into American society and the labor force,"" Trump said. 
Critics say that Trump has abandoned a longstanding U.S. role as a safe haven for persecuted people and that cutting refugee admissions undermines other foreign policy goals. 
Trump's Democratic rival and former Vice President Joe Biden has pledged to raise refugee admissions to 125,000 a year if he defeats Trump, although advocates have said the program could take years to recover. 
Tens of thousands of refugees have applications in the pipeline for the United States, even as increased vetting by the Trump administration and the novel coronavirus have slowed arrivals for the 2020 fiscal year, which had an 18,000 quota.
Trump's 2021 plan allocates 5,000 slots for refugees facing religious persecution, 4,000 for refugees from Iraq who helped the United States, and 1,000 for refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, leaving 5,000 for others.

It bans refugees from Somalia, Syria and Yemen except in cases of ""special humanitarian concern,"" citing terrorism risk.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's health minister said on Wednesday Spaniards were right to be angry at him attending an awards ceremony with dozens of other high-profile figures shortly after the country entered a state of emergency to control its second wave of coronavirus. 
Photographs of Monday's event at the glamorous Casino de Madrid, which showed many guests without masks, quickly went viral and sparked outrage among Spaniards who felt they were being held to a double standard. 
Among the attendees were four cabinet ministers, opposition leader Pablo Casado and several of his deputies, as well as a cluster of corporate leaders. 
Speaking in parliament, Health Minister Salvador Illa said the event complied with all restrictions and that he only stayed to present an award to the armed forces. 
""After giving the prize, maybe you don't know it, but I left. I didn't stay for dinner,"" he said. 
He acknowledged his attendance had set a bad example. 
""Even those events that meet all requirements are best avoided,"" he said. ""The best way to social distance is by not going and we should all follow this path because citizens are right (to be annoyed).""
Many Spaniards are frustrated with their government's efforts to control the pandemic, which has killed more than 35,000 people and infected over a million, making Spain one of the worst hotspots in Europe.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez declared a nationwide state of emergency that he hopes to extend for six months, along with night-time curfews. Private social gatherings are limited to six people but larger public events are allowed under certain limits, including on how many people can attend. 
Online news website El Espanol, which organised the event, said it was both safe and legal, as the attendance of 80 people was equivalent to 33% of the venue's capacity. 
But Gabriel Rufian, spokesman for left-wing Catalan separatist ERC and Ivan Espinosa de los Monteros, spokesman for the far-right Vox party, were among those who chastised fellow parliamentarians for attending the event.

""They party with you until late at night while regular Spaniards are being locked down and threatened with all kind of punishment,"" Espinosa de los Monteros told parliament.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 09:01AM ET</span>",A Chicago dad wanted revenge after his son was shot. An outreach worker talked him down,"By Brendan O'Brien
CHICAGO - On a warm evening last spring, Bo Deal got word that a teenager had been shot at a street corner in Chicago's Austin neighborhood. He raced to the scene and quickly pieced together from eyewitnesses what had gone down.
A 17-year-old named Javell Gates, he learned, had taken a bullet to the foot while buying a snow cone from a street vender. Deal recognized the teen's name - he was friends with his father, Jervelle Gates. 
Within minutes, Deal was on the phone, trying to calm the father, fearing that the man would want revenge. Deal's job is to stop that from happening.
He is one of more than 200 outreach workers in Chicago trained in conflict resolution and employed by non-profit organizations. Their mission is to step into volatile situations and prevent further violence in a city plagued by an epidemic of shootings in recent years.
""I'm just trying to save lives,"" said Deal, 42, a field manager for one of the non-profits, Metropolitan Family Services. ""I get out and grind daily to try to reduce some of the violence in our neighborhood."" 
Over the last 15 years, similar programs have sprouted up in Los Angeles, New York and other big U.S. cities. Studies have shown violence intervention programs can be effective in reducing shootings and deaths.
Such an approach has attracted renewed attention since the death of George Floyd while in custody of the Minneapolis police in late May. The killing sparked calls for police departments to be defunded and to shift more money into community-oriented crime prevention programs such as the outreach work performed by Deal and his colleagues. 
""It's not that we overfund police; it's that we underfund community-based violence prevention. You can't just arrest your way out of violence, but you also can't just program your way out of it either,"" said Thomas Abt, senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has touted violence intervention as a vital tool in the city's crime fighting ecosystem. In January, she announced a $7.5 million investment in local non-profit organizations employing these workers, saying the city would move toward more community-based approaches to crime.
The job is part conciliator, part social worker. Many are former gang members, who use their neighborhood connections to get tips about disputes bubbling up on social media or street corners. They then use their skills to broker a peaceful resolution before the dispute can turn deadly.
It has been a busy year for Deal and other outreach workers in Chicago. The city has experienced its second most violent year in a decade, in part because of the social disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, criminologists say. 
When a shooting or stabbing takes place, field workers reach work with the victim's family and friends to cool tensions and prevent retaliation, just as Deal had done when Javell Gates was wounded.
On May 29, the day of the shooting, Javell's father, 36-year-old Jervelle Gates was at home under house arrest awaiting trial on a federal gun case when his son called to say he had been wounded in a drive-by shooting. His friends, Javell told his father, were rushing him to the hospital.
""I'm sweating - I'm that mad,"" recalled Jervelle Gates when asked by a Reuters reporter how he felt after his son called.
The elder Gates said he called the sheriff's department, asking if he could leave the house to meet his son at the hospital, but he was denied permission. 
Feeling even more agitated, Gates considered tearing off his ankle monitor and bolting. He went to his car, started it, but hesitated, knowing if he left he would become a wanted man.
""Somebody just hurt somebody that I love, how am I supposed to react?"" said Gates. ""I call the gang bangers asking them what's going on with my son ... I needed a target."" 
Next he called Deal, an old friend, who was expecting his call after recognizing the name of the victim who was shot. 
""Bo knows everything. If Bo doesn't know yet, Bo can find out,"" Gates said. 
Deal told Gates the gunman acted alone and the suspects were in custody. But he stopped short of providing the father with any more specific information, concerned it would be used to exact revenge. Instead, he let Gates vent. 
Over the following days the men spoke about life and the future, conversations which Gates said changed his perspective on the best way to move forward after the shooting. He is now seeking employment and volunteer opportunities.   

""Success is the best revenge,"" Gates said.

Turkish anger at the caricature added fuel to a row between Turkey and France about cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, which flared after a teacher who had shown pupils the cartoons in a lesson on freedom of speech was beheaded in France this month.
The cartoon on the cover of Charlie Hebdo showed Erdogan sitting in a white T-shirt and underpants, holding a canned drink along with a woman wearing an Islamic hijab.
""Our people should have no doubt that all necessary legal and diplomatic steps will be taken against the caricature in question,"" Turkey's Communications Directorate said.
""Our battle against these rude, ill-intentioned and insulting steps will continue until the end with reason but determination,"" it said in a statement.
Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul told reporters in Ankara that Turkish authorities had taken all necessary initiatives with the relevant authorities. State media also reported that Turkish prosecutors had launched an investigation into Charlie Hebdo's executives.
Top Turkish officials had condemned the caricature, with presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin saying it had no respect for ""any belief, sacredness and values"" and showed ""their own vulgarity and immorality. He said the caricature could not be considered freedom of expression.
Turkish presidential communications director Fahrettin Altun said ""Macron’s anti-Muslim agenda is bearing fruit!"" 
""We condemn this most disgusting effort by this publication to spread its cultural racism and hatred,"" Altun wrote on Twitter.
Erdogan sharply criticised Macron at the weekend, saying the French leader needed a mental health check, prompting France to recall its ambassador from Ankara. On Monday, Erdogan urged a boycott of French products.

The Prophet Mohammad cartoons, considered blasphemous by Muslims, have been displayed in France in solidarity and Macron has said he would redouble efforts to stop conservative Islamic beliefs subverting French values, angering many Muslims.

Tarhouna had for years been controlled by a militia known as the Kaniyat, run by the local Kani family, which fought alongside Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA). 
The GNA has issued arrest warrants for Kaniyat leaders who are now believed to be in eastern Libya. 
When Turkish support helped the internationally recognised GNA take back Tarhouna in a sudden advance in June, its fighters found a hospital piled with bodies and unmarked graves containing missing people. 
Investigators from the GNA's missing persons bureau have since then been working, in white forensic suits, to dig through the ruddy earth around Tarhouna for human remains and to identify the bodies. 
Many of the bodies recovered so far were those found in the hospital. However, dozens of bodies have also been unearthed from the unmarked grave sites. 

Some of the bodies discovered show the marks of violence, including, among those revealed this week, a smashed skull and dismembered limbs, a missing persons bureau official said.

BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's army said on Wednesday it killed 33 militiamen and lost two soldiers as it seized two rebel strongholds in four days of intense fighting in the north-eastern Ituri province.
United Nations peacekeepers also helped the army repel an attack by a wing of the armed militia group known as CODECO, which attempted to storm the province's capital Bunia on Saturday, a U.N. spokesman said.
Drawn largely from the Lendu ethnic group, CODECO is accused by the U.N. of widespread and systematic killings, beheadings, rape and other barbaric acts that have contributed to prolonged instability in the east of the country.
Violence in the area has largely subsided since some elements of the group announced a ceasefire in August, following an appeal made through former warlords in the region.
On Saturday morning CODECO fighters loyal to the rebel leader known as ""Mountain Wolf"" attacked an army position near Dele, 6 km (4 miles) south-east of Bunia, the U.N. said in a statement.
""They wanted to teach our troops a lesson but instead they suffered themselves,"" said Jules Ngongo, an army spokesman.
Rich in natural resources, Ituri experienced some of the country's most vicious fighting between 1999 and 2007, after a power struggle between rebel groups descended into ethnic bloodshed, mostly between the Hema and Lendu communities.
After a decade of relative calm, tit-for-tat fighting resumed in December 2017, reviving longstanding tensions over land. The unrest has since evolved into more coordinated attacks by CODECO on the army and the Hema group.
Since June 2018, hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes in Ituri province, bringing the number of displaced people to more than a million.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarus basketball star Yelena Leuchanka has twice represented her country at the Olympic Games, but until this year she had always stayed out of politics. That changed abruptly when her country was engulfed by protests.
When she joined a street demonstration against President Alexander Lukashenko, one of the country's best known athletes found herself arrested and jailed in a lice-ridden cell.
Released after 15 days, the former center who played four seasons in the U.S. Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) has added her name to an open letter of protest signed by nearly 1,000 Belarusian sports figures.
""I want us to be free in a new Belarus, where we can freely express our opinions and not be afraid to be fired, imprisoned, fined, beaten or intimidated for it,"" the 37-year-old Leuchanka told Reuters.
The open letter condemns the Aug. 9 presidential election won by Lukashenko as fraudulent and demands a re-run. It calls for the release of all those detained during more than 11 weeks of street protests and strikes against the veteran leader.
The athletes - including freestyle skier Hanna Huskova, who was the 2018 Olympic champion in aerials, and swimmer Aliaksandra Herasimenia, a three-time Olympic medallist - say they will stick together.
""If information emerges about attempts to pressure the sports representatives who have signed this letter, or threats to sack them or infringe their rights, all the athletes will act in solidarity including by potentially refusing to turn out for the national team,"" the letter says.
The Belarusian Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
BREAKING STEREOTYPES
The protest highlights how discontent has seeped even into social groups traditionally loyal to the state. In former Soviet countries, it is rare for elite athletes to publicly criticize the government, which often provides much of their funding.
""I think we are breaking stereotypes because for a very long time everyone thought that athletes are only athletes..., that we only train,"" said Leuchanka, who was detained at Minsk airport on Sept. 30 as she was about to fly to Greece for medical treatment.
""How can we remain silent when it is time for us to be fans of our people?""
Leuchanka says she had never even voted until this year. It was a combination of factors - Lukashenko's dismissive attitude to the coronavirus, the imprisonment or self-exile of other presidential candidates, and police violence against demonstrators - that compelled her to join the protests.
""I could just close my eyes to this, leave and live comfortably,"" she said. ""But I can't."" 
""The people of Belarus woke up this summer. We wanted some changes, we wanted to try something new. We've been living under the same president for 26 years."" 
Standing a towering 196 cm (6 feet 5 inches) tall, Leuchanka was crammed into a Minsk prison cell with up to four other people, where she tried to keep fit with breathing exercises and squats.
With no mattress, flushing toilet or access to showers, she says she contracted lice and developed dermatitis all over her body. Her old athletics injuries flared up.
She finally flew to Greece last week to receive the treatment she had planned before her time in jail. 
Reflecting on her ordeal, Leuchanka believes the authorities chose to make an example of a well-known professional athlete.

""I feel sorry for them,"" she told Reuters. ""We (demonstrators) are in a prison, behind bars, but, believe me, we are much more free than they are.""

""If the terrorists here are not cleared as we were promised, we have the legitimate right to mobilise once again,"" Erdogan said in a speech to his AK Party's lawmakers in parliament. 
In an offensive a year ago, with the support of Syrian rebels, Turkey seized a 120 km (75 mile) stretch of border territory in northeast Syria from the Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara views as a terrorist group.
That incursion was widely condemned by Ankara's Western allies as the YPG was a the main component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that helped the United States defeat Islamic State.
Erdogan also voiced concern about the situation in northwest Syria's Idlib region, which was the scene of heavy fighting between Syrian government forces and Turkey-backed rebels until Ankara and Moscow reached a ceasefire deal in March.
On Monday, air strikes on a camp in northwest Syria run by rebel fighters backed by Turkey killed at least 35 people and wounded scores, a war monitor and a rebel source said.

""The attack by Russia on (Turkey-backed) Syrian National Army forces in the Idlib region shows that lasting peace in the region is not wanted,"" Erdogan said.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Analysis: Biden would face uncertain path to detente with wary Iran,"By Parisa Hafezi and Arshad Mohammed
DUBAI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Joe Biden plans to scrap what he calls the ""dangerous failure"" of President Donald Trump's maximum pressure policy on Iran should he win the U.S. election, but after years of confrontation his diplomacy-first approach to a historic Middle East foe could prove an unforgiving challenge.
Vice president under President Barack Obama when Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers was struck, Biden has pledged that if Tehran resumes compliance with the pact he will return to the agreement, which Trump quit in 2018, reimposing sanctions.
With Iran's economy crippled, its ties with Washington have been at boiling point ever since, and an international consensus over Iran's nuclear work -- which the West suspected was aimed at creating a nuclear bomb -- has been in disarray. 
The pressure on Iran's leaders to escape from sanctions is severe. Their core support comes from poorer Iranians struggling to survive as the price of bread, cooking oil and other staples has soared and the rial currency has plummeted.
The coronavirus has only compounded the pressure. The Iranian media regularly report layoffs and strikes by workers who have not been paid for months. 
But among the obstacles facing Biden, a Democrat, in his bid to reopen a pathway to detente are Iran's mistrust of Washington, which deepened sharply when Trump tore up the deal.
""Why should we trust Biden? He is like Obama. You cannot trust Democrats,"" said a hardline official close to the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, adding Trump might eventually offer a better deal than the abandoned 2015 accord.
Both Trump and Biden have yet to detail how they plan to persuade Iran to go along with their respective approaches.
The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday slapped counterterrorism sanctions on key players in Iran's oil sector for supporting the Quds Force, the elite paramilitary arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
DEMANDS FOR COMPENSATION
Trump has said he wants to strike a new deal with Tehran that would address Iran's missile programme and support for regional proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
For his part, Biden's idea appears to be a return to the 2015 deal as a prelude to a wider talks on Iran's nuclear work, its ballistic missiles and regional activities.
However, returning to the original deal is not a simple matter. 
Among the complexities are Iranian demands for compensation for damages it suffered following Trump's restoration of nuclear-related sanctions; Tehran's likely demand for the removal of other, non-nuclear U.S. sanctions imposed since May 2018; and the time and money it would take to disassemble and store centrifuges that it has re-installed, including at its Fordow nuclear complex, where uranium enrichment was barred under the nuclear deal.
""Aside from returning to the deal, the next U.S administration should compensate Tehran for the damages during the withdrawal ... and of course make commitments to ensure that such violations are not repeated,"" Iran's government spokesman Ali Rabeie told reporters on Tuesday.
Iran's leadership has ruled out halting its missile programme or changing its regional policy, although it said last year it had no plans to increase the range of its missiles. Tehran says it will negotiate only if Washington lifts sanctions.
While Iranians' economic misery places pressure on Tehran to negotiate an easing of the sanctions, the Iranian electoral calendar means any deal is unlikely to come quickly.
HOSTILITY 
Iranian officials say any talks would have to take place after Iran's presidential elections in mid-2021, which anti-U.S. security hawks are expected to win.
""If Biden wins, talks will start after Iran's presidential election. It will give hardliners some space to secure their election win,"" one Iranian government official said.
""Not much compromise should be expected from Iran's side,"" said an Iranian security official. ""If Biden wins, don't expect too much bargaining room from (Khamenei)."" 
While Iranian leaders have refrained from publicly endorsing either man, some officials suggest hardliners loyal to Khamenei would prefer to deal with Trump rather than Biden. 
That is not only because Iran feels it can handle Trump's transactional, business-minded approach to diplomacy. 
It is also because the hostility he evokes among Iranians could be used by hardliners in elections to reinforce their political position as the nation's valiant defenders.
""All these issues can be negotiated and resolved. Tehran needs sanctions to be lifted and Americans want a calm Middle East. A win-win solution can be reached. When there is a will, there is a way,"" the Iranian security official said.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>","In Beirut port, all of Lebanon’s ills are laid bare","By Samia Nakhoul, Ellen Francis and Michael Georgy
BEIRUT (Reuters) - The first of many warnings about a deadly cargo in Beirut's port came in February 2014, about three months after its arrival. It was made by Colonel Joseph Skaf, described by his family as a diligent customs official.
Skaf, then the head of the anti-narcotics and money laundering division, informed the customs authority that the shipment of ammonium nitrate was ""extremely dangerous"" and posed a risk to the public.
In his handwritten letter, reviewed by Reuters and authenticated by a source familiar with the case, he urged that the ship, the Rhosus, be ""moved away from the pier to the breakwater and if possible put under surveillance."" 
Reuters couldn't determine whether Skaf, who died in 2017, received a response to his letter or whether he followed up on his warning. The office of the customs director referred questions about the matter to the finance ministry. The ministry didn't respond.
Skaf's brother Elie recalls the colonel saying of the cargo, in 2014: ""We will refuse to let them unload it."" Skaf's son Michel says his father's determination to keep the Rhosus out of the port was typical of a man who ""didn't let things pass"" and challenged the wrongs he saw.
Skaf's letter, dated Feb. 21, 2014, was the first of several warnings by port, customs and security officials about the ammonium nitrate on board the Rhosus. None were acted on.
Skaf moved a few months later to a new job overseeing airport customs. Shortly afterwards, in late 2014, the Rhosus' cargo was transferred to a dockside warehouse. It exploded on August 4 this year, destroying whole neighborhoods and killing nearly 200 people.
For the people of Lebanon, the wreckage of the port, and the failure to heed the warnings of Skaf and others, has a wider symbolism. Nearly three months on from the blast, they are still waiting for the results of an investigation their leaders promised would reveal the truth within days. Efforts to form a new, non-partisan government foundered on Lebanon's sectarian politics. In this chaos, international aid money, contingent on a new government stamping out corruption, has yet to flow.
Skaf's family believes his death in 2017 was murder, possibly connected to his long career as a customs officer fighting criminality and drug smuggling, or his recent entry into politics. The official medical report, produced in 2017, found Skaf died in a fall. A second report, commissioned by the family, concluded in 2018 that Skaf was attacked. 
CORRUPTION BEYOND IMAGINATION
The port, one of the busiest in the eastern Mediterranean, handling an estimated $15 billion of trade a year at its height, was rife with corruption, negligence and sectarian politics, according to nine people involved in shipping, clearance and administration. Their accounts were buttressed by import documents that one of the sources showed to Reuters.
The port mirrored the country at large, with jobs shared out along sectarian lines among mainly Muslim and Christian groups. It's an arrangement that has governed Lebanon over the past three decades, and is blamed by many for plunging the country into financial ruin.
As one senior minister told Reuters: ""The level of corruption in all layers of the state is beyond imagination. How much more corruption, like the port, is hidden beneath the cloaks of politicians?"" He said he has received threats warning him ""not to dig into corruption."" He didn't elaborate.
After Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, a transitional committee, representing the main sectarian political groups, was formed to manage Beirut's port temporarily. The committee remains to this day.
Port chief Hassan Koraytem is widely seen as a loyalist of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, while customs boss Badri Daher's nomination was backed by Christian President Michel Aoun's party. 
Koraytem and Daher have been detained in connection with the explosion on suspicion of criminal negligence. Koraytem's lawyer, who says his client bears no responsibility for the blast, told Reuters political appointments are commonplace in Lebanon, not only at the port, and ""that doesn't mean every appointee is corrupt."" A lawyer for Daher said he couldn't comment during an ongoing investigation.
Hariri's office denied putting loyalists into key jobs. Aoun's media office said appointments during the president's term, including Daher's, were made based on ""competence and experience.""
Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah maintains an indirect presence at the port through merchant allies, three of the sources said. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has denied it has any such influence.
With the port at the mercy of rival groups, decision-making was crippled, there was no oversight and a culture of impunity flourished, the nine sources told Reuters.
""This chaos suits everybody. It is very hard to crack,"" said Lamia Bissat, head of Lebanon's Institut des Finances Basil Fuleihan, an independent public body researching policy and governance.
According to a 2019 study by academics at Oxford University and Columbia University, 17 out of Lebanon's 21 shipping line companies have links to politicians via their board members, managers or shareholders.
Lebanese analyst Sarkis Naoum estimates the state has missed out on billions of dollars in duty payments ""because of the smuggling, under invoicing and theft that goes on"" at the port. ""Even warehouse guards have enriched themselves from bribes."" 
Some importers have exploited duty exemptions for humanitarian and religious bodies as cover to import electronic items, construction materials, clothes, liquor, furniture and food, the sources said.
A clearing agent described paying $100 to a port inspector to get a container processed. Another showed Reuters two customs documents. In the first, his application to have his cargo cleared swiftly was rejected by customs officials. In the second, it was approved. The difference, he said, was that the second time he paid a bribe.
The sources said some porters were told to clear cargoes without checking them. Many scanners used to inspect goods didn't work properly, said Fouad Bawarshi, Deputy CEO of Gezairi shipping agent. His account was confirmed by other shipping agents.
Under-invoicing - a ruse to avoid paying the full import duty - was routine. Merchants would pay bribes to politicians and their agents at the port to ensure cargoes were valued well below their worth, the sources said.
Bissat, the head of Institut des Finances Basil Fuleihan, who has done extensive work on customs systems, said efforts to reform the port by installing automated systems and bringing in processes to curb corruption were resisted by all sides, including by politicians, customs and port officials and businessmen.
""No one could change without changing the whole system,"" she said. ""There was a proposal for modernizing the port authority."" It didn't go anywhere. Bissat didn't elaborate further. 
She said she and other researchers had provided port authorities with a manual on how to handle chemicals, including nitrate. ""You could not imagine that some people would be that reckless. It is just beyond imagination.""
A FAMILY SEEKS ANSWERS
Skaf's family say he dealt with many sensitive cases during his career as a customs official, including some involving drugs. Colleagues sometimes warned him to be careful because of the nature of his work, said the source familiar with the case.
In the early hours of one morning in March 2017, Skaf's jeep was found parked with its light on near his apartment building. The colonel's bloodied body lay at the bottom of a nearly 1.8m drop nearby.
He had recently retired and was running for parliament in his hometown in south Lebanon. He was 57.
Skaf's brother Elie said the first forensic doctor to examine Skaf told him that marks on the colonel's body suggested he had been attacked. 
Two medical reports, reviewed by Reuters, found Skaf had a fractured skull and listed injuries including a swollen eye, a broken rib and bruising. The first of these documents was the official medical committee report of 2017. It concluded a fall led to a brain hemorrhage, causing Skaf's death. It made no mention of an attack.
Unconvinced, Elie hired a forensic expert to review the case file. This doctor concluded, in the second report, dated 2018, that Skaf's injuries suggested he was ""subjected to a sudden, aggressive act that led to his fall."" The report said Skaf suffered ""a strong punch to his left eye"" and a ""very strong kick to the bottom of his rib cage."" 
Elie appointed a lawyer who asked Lebanese authorities to re-examine the case. A spokesman for Lebanon's Internal Security Forces, which Elie said was overseeing the case, didn't respond to a request for comment. Questions to the interior ministry were referred to the ISF.
""It's been about a year since then, and we don't know anything,"" said Elie. ""They don't tell us anything.""

The family's struggle to get answers has struck a chord in a country where officials are rarely held to account. In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post soon after the port blast, Skaf's son Michel wrote: ""A crime was committed in March 2017. My father did not slip and fall. He was brutally assaulted and murdered in front of his own house. The case was never closed and our family has been waiting for 3 years for a serious investigation, as his case sits on some desk gathering dust. We want a true investigation, we want justice and the truth for Colonel Joseph Skaf.""

Images, video and an Instagram live feed from a popular DJ spread news of shootings in Lagos on Oct. 20, when witnesses and rights groups said the military fired on peaceful protesters.
The protesters had been demonstrating for nearly two weeks to demand an end to police brutality. The army denied its soldiers were there.
Social media helped spread word of the shootings worldwide, and international celebrities from Beyonce and Lewis Hamilton to Pope Francis since called on the country to resolve the conflict peacefully.
Information Minister Lai Mohammed told a panel at the National Assembly on Tuesday that ""fake news"" is one of the biggest challenges facing Nigeria. 
A spokesman for the minister confirmed the comments, and said ""the use of the social media to spread fake news and disinformation means there is the need to do something about it."" 
Officials have said some videos and photos posted during the protests were fake news but have not said that about the shootings.
In the weeks before the shootings, protesters had also used social media to organise, raise money and share what they said was proof of police harassment, which increased pressure on authorities to respond to their demands. 

 Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey Tweeted to encouraged his followers to contribute, and the hashtag #EndSARS was trending for several days, referencing the widely feared Special Anti-Robbery Squad that they successfully demanded be abolished.

The visit was announced in a short statement on the government's news website and will mark the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the government said.
The U.S. State Department has not confirmed that Pompeo will be adding Vietnam to his four-leg tour. Pompeo arrived in the Maldives on Wednesday after visits to Sri Lanka and India and is due to hold meetings in Indonesia on Thursday. 
A spokesman for Pompeo declined to comment about the announcement of a Vietnam leg.
Deadly foes during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s, Vietnam and the United States have enjoyed significantly warmer relations in recent years.
But there have some trade tensions of late, with the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) confirming in August that at President Donald Trump's behest, it was investigating whether Vietnam had been undervaluing its dong currency and harming U.S. commerce.
Vietnam's prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, this week called on Trump to have ""a more objective assessment of the reality in Vietnam"" with regards to the trade imbalance between the two countries.
Phuc said the exchange rate policy was not aimed at helping its exports.
Both countries are also wary of an increasingly assertive China.
Pompeo said in Sri Lanka on Wednesday the Chinese Communist Party was operating as a ""predator"".
The previous day in India, he said the Chinese ruling party was ""no friend to democracy, the rule of law, transparency, nor to freedom of navigation, the foundation of a free and open, prosperous Indo-Pacific"".
The United States has also been active in pushing for better resource data-sharing and disaster management projects for countries downstream of China that depend on the Mekong River for agriculture and fisheries, which include Vietnam.
Environmentalists say the river has become a new front for U.S.-China rivalry. 

On another front, in the South China Sea, Pompeo last month urged Southeast Asian countries to stand up to bullying by China and to reassess business deals with its state firms.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Wednesday described the COVID-19 pandemic as a tough ""lady"" taskmaster who must be obeyed, but he and most close aides did not wear masks at his general audience.
At the start of the indoor audience Francis apologised to people for not coming down from the marble stage.
""I will stay up here. I would very much like to come down and greet each of you but we have to keep our distances,"" he said to the crowd of several hundred, nearly all wearing masks.
""If I come down, immediately people will form groups ... and this is against the care, the precautions, we must have in the face of this lady named COVID, who is doing us much harm,"" he said.
The pope and most aides and translators on the stage did not wear masks. Swiss Guards and official photographers on the stage wore masks but bishops and priests who greeted the pope close up removed their masks as they approached him.
Thirteen Swiss Guards and a resident of the guest house where the pope lives have recently tested positive for COVID-19.
The pope, who had part of one lung removed because of an illness when he was a young man, has come under fire, mostly on social media, for not always wearing a mask in public.
On Oct. 20, he wore a mask for several hours at a prayer service in Rome with other religious leaders, taking it off only when he spoke. Last Saturday, no-one in the pope's private library wore a mask when he spoke with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and his delegation.
In a video conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Father Augusto Zampini, a member of a Vatican commission the pope set up to advise him on the social effects of the crisis, acknowledged Francis' inconsistency.

""We are trying to convince him, we are almost there,"" Zampini said.

(Reuters) - New York police arrested about 30 people as hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Brooklyn late on Tuesday following a deadly police shooting in Philadelphia of a Black man armed with a knife.
""Approximately 30 people have been arrested"", a New York Police Department spokesman told Reuters by phone, without detailing the reason for the arrests.
He added that one NYPD officer suffered ""non-life threatening"" injuries during the late night protests. Police also said that their vehicles were damaged and some trash cans were set on fire in the demonstrations.
NBC News reported that a car attempted to drive through a group of police officials in Brooklyn.
The development in New York City came after the deadly Philadelphia police shooting on Monday of Walter Wallace, 27, who was described by relatives as suffering from a mental breakdown as he was confronted by law enforcement.
It follows months of anti-racism protests that have spread across the United States since the death in May of George Floyd, an African-American who died after a Minneapolis police official knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. 
The protests, which have sometimes turned violent, have aimed at achieving racial equality and opposing police brutality.
Philadelphia became the latest flash point in the United States on issues of race and police use of force, as Tuesday's rallies began peacefully but grew confrontational as darkness fell, just as on the previous day.
A bystander's video of the shooting of Wallace was posted on social media on Monday and showed him approaching two police officers who had drawn their guns and warned him to put down his knife. The officers were backing up before the camera cut briefly away as gunfire erupted and Wallace collapsed.

Nigeria has been on edge following one of its biggest social upheavals in 20 years. Demonstrations across the country turned violent on Oct. 20 when witnesses in Lagos said the military opened fire on peaceful protesters shortly after local authorities imposed a 24-hour curfew, drawing international condemnation. 
The Lagos government asked the army to deploy due to ""violence which led to several police stations being burnt, policemen killed, suspects in police custody released and weapons carted away,"" the military said in a statement published late on Tuesday said.
""The Nigerian army in the discharge of its constitutional responsibilities did not shoot at any civilian as there are glaring and convincing evidence to attest to this fact,"" the statement said, without providing details of the evidence.
The army, which has said it was not at the site of the shooting at the Lekki Toll Gate, and the Lagos state governor's office did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment. The military statement did not say how they intervened to curb unrest beyond denying that its men shot civilians.
Police and soldiers killed at least 12 people in two Lagos neighbourhoods on Oct. 20, according to witnesses and rights group Amnesty International. Police have also denied involvement.
Witnesses at Lekki described armed men in army fatigues arriving at the site of the peaceful protests around 7 p.m., where demonstrators knelt to wave flags and sing the national anthem, before the men raised their guns and shot into the crowd.

Magufuli's main challengers include Tundu Lissu, who was shot 16 times in 2017, and former foreign minister Bernard Membe. The attack on Lissu, who returned from three years in exile in July, has never been solved. 
People turned out early to cast their ballots in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday morning. 
""The voting process is good, calm,"" local pastor Clement Fumbo told Reuters after voting. ""I expect the election to continue to be peaceful, fair and free.""
But many Tanzanians complained online that they were are experiencing problems accessing social media platforms. 
""Authorities are now trying to block VPN services,"" said ProtonVPN, an open source VPN provider, on Twitter.

The government projects economic growth of 5.5% in 2020 after COVID-19 hit key sectors such as tourism. But the World Bank predicts growth of only 2.5%. 
Magufuli is promising voters that new infrastructure projects will fuel growth of at least 8% soon. 
""We have told Tanzanians the importance of investing on transport infrastructure...for the betterment of this nation,"" Magufuli said on Tuesday in Dodoma at his last rally.

More than 29 million people are registered to vote out of 58 million citizens. They will choose from 15 presidential candidates and elect lawmakers for 264 parliamentary seats. 
The ruling party CCM, a version of which has held power since independence in 1961, won the presidency with 58% of votes in 2015 and currently holds about three-quarters of parliamentary seats. Tanzania uses a first-past-the post system.
The opposition and rights groups say authorities have cracked down on critical voices by closing down media outlets and banning public rallies during Magufuli's first term.
Last week, a coalition of 65 international rights groups issued a letter accusing the government of harassing NGOs and abusing the power of the justice system. 
""Tanzania's criminal justice system has ... been misused to target those who criticize the government,"" the letter read. 
Opposition parties said police disrupted their campaigns and electoral authorities disqualified dozens of their parliamentary candidates.
The government has previously denied any crackdown and the National Electoral Commission has rejected accusations of unfair treatment.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's king urged lawmakers on Wednesday to put aside political disagreements to pass the 2021 budget ""without disturbance"", as Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin grapples with the coronavirus crisis and a leadership challenge.
Muhyiddin's administration is scheduled to present its first budget on Nov. 6, amid a challenge for the premiership by opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim and at a time when his credibility is seen to have taken a hit after a failed attempt to secure royal assent to declare emergency rule.
King Al-Sultan Abdullah said next year's budget is vital in helping the public manage the effects of the coronavirus and restore the economy.
In a statement, the national palace said the king also called on lawmakers to abide by his decree for an end to all political disagreements ""so that the 2021 Budget can be passed without disturbance"".
""His Majesty reminds MPs that political fights for personal interest will be a loss to the nation and the people will be come victims at a time when the country is still struggling to face the threat of COVID-19,"" the palace said in the statement.
Opposition leaders said they could support the budget if the government grants equal access for all lawmakers to resources and avenues to provide input, and carries out democratic reforms.
Wong Chen, a lawmaker with Anwar's People's Justice Party, said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that the reforms should include establishing ""an unfettered right"" to table a motion of no confidence in parliament.
Parliament Speaker Azhar Harun said more than 16 motions of no confidence in Muhyiddin's leadership have been filed for the upcoming meeting, the Utusan Malaysia daily reported.
Muhyiddin, who has a thin majority in parliament, is also under pressure from unhappy coalition partners who have demanded more powerful positions, while a resurgence in coronavirus infections is battering the economy.

But Muhyiddin gained some respite on Monday when a key ally walked back on threats to withdraw support.

SRINAGAR,India (Reuters) - India has amended a law in Jammu and Kashmir allowing Indian citizens to buy land in the disputed territory, said officials, sparking opposition criticism about a steady erosion of the rights of Kashmiri people.
A notification issued on Tuesday stated that the term ""being permanent resident of the state"" as a criteria has been ""omitted"", paving the way for even non-Kashmiri Indians to purchase land in the Himalayan region.
Until last year, the region enjoyed a special status, guaranteed by the Indian constitution, which allowed it to make its own rules about permanent residency and property ownership.
Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan and both rule parts of it. The region continues to be at the heart of two of the three wars fought by India and Pakistan since independence in 1947.
India's portion has been plagued by separatist violence since the late 1980s. 
In Aug 2019, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government scrapped the region's autonomy. The decision to strip it of its special status and split it into two federally-administered territories sparked widespread protests in the region.
Modi's government had earlier said that uniformity in rules and governance will bring development to the region.
The latest amendments to land rules are part of the government's policy to apply all Indian laws that were not applicable for about seven decades, local and federal government officials said.
""Amendment to land laws is crucial part of structural changes being made in Jammu and Kashmir. The region should be governed like any other part of the country,"" said a senior home ministry official on conditions of anonymity.
Opposition leaders in Kashmir have criticised the Modi government for rewriting the land laws.
""The amendments have put Jammu and Kashmir up for sale...These new laws are unacceptable to people of J&K,"" said former chief minister Omar Abdullah in a tweet.

Abdullah was one among the 5,000 people detained last year ahead of scrapping of Kashmir's autonomy last year.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Residents of Ivory Coast's biggest city Abidjan are stocking up on provisions and sending loved ones to rural villages ahead of a contentious presidential election on Saturday many fear could turn violent.
Suzanne Ble, 34, her two young daughters and a son, were among the hundreds of passengers at a bus station in Abidjan on Tuesday, sitting atop their luggage, waiting to get a ticket.
""I'm taking my family to Toumodi, (in the centre of the country) because of the political situation. We are afraid that it will degenerate,"" Ble said.
Many Ivorians had hoped the 2020 election would help turn the page on a cycle of violence around elections, and see President Alassane Ouattara transfer power to a new generation.
Instead, ahead of the vote citizens of the relatively prosperous but volatile West African nation of 25 million face a familiar set of choices - and fears.
After initially saying he wouldn't stand for a third term, Ouattara, 78, reversed course when his preferred successor died unexpectedly in July. He argued that a new constitution approved in 2016 reset his two-term limit.
His decision, denounced by opponents as unconstitutional, sparked violent protests and clashes between rival supporters that have killed nearly 30 people. 
Pro-democracy activists say it also marks a fresh setback for the region after Mali's military coup in August and Guinea President Alpha Conde's successful third-term bid earlier this month. 
Ouattara's two main challengers are veterans of Ivory Coast's many crises since the 1990s: the 86-year-old former president Henri Konan Bedie and 67-year-old Pascal Affi N'Guessan, a prime minister under Ouattara's predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo. 
Gbagbo's refusal to concede defeat when Ouattara beat him in the 2010 election led to a brief civil war that killed 3,000 people.
""It's been 10, 15, 20 years that we see some of them,"" Francis Ake, a 28-year-old telecommunications worker said of the candidates as he left church. ""We need new people."" 
BITTER RIVALS, UNCERTAINTY 
Bedie and Affi have urged their supporters to boycott the electoral process, which they say is rigged. The have called for the vote to be postponed.
Bedie, served as president from 1993 to 1999, when he was overthrown in a coup. 
A bitter rival of Ouattara, in 1995, his government barred Ouattara from running for president after questioning his nationality, an issue that contributed to later conflicts. 
As of Monday, only 41.5% of registered voters' identification cards had been picked up, the electoral commission said.
With his main rivals boycotting the race, there is little suspense about Ouattara's likely victory, but great uncertainty remains about nearly everything else. 
Experts and investors say they do not expect an all-out war like the one in 2010 and 2011 since there do not appear to be significant splits within the security forces this time. 
However, they warn about a potentially protracted stand-off marked by protests, strikes and ethnic violence that would make it difficult for Ouattara to govern and weigh on the economy of the world's top cocoa producer. 
""This is an election that will not produce a true winner,"" said Wendyam Herve Lankoande, an analyst with International Crisis Group. ""The country will be divided and weakened."" 
Under Ouattara, Ivory Coast swiftly rebuilt its economy through infrastructure and agriculture investments. GDP growth over his tenure averaged more than 8% before the pandemic.
Critics say the economic benefits have not trickled down to the poor and accuse the president of ignoring the persistent ethnic and regional animosities that led to the country's de facto partition in 2002 and the war in 2010.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the Chinese Communist Party was operating as a ""predator"" in Sri Lanka, as the top U.S. diplomat kept up tough criticism of China on a tour of Asia.
Pompeo arrived in Sri Lanka from India as part of a four-leg tour aimed at bolstering allies against China's increasing political and military inroads in the region in recent years.
""We see from bad deals, violations of sovereignty and lawlessness on land and sea that the Chinese Communist Party is a predator, and the United States comes in a different way, we come as a friend, and as a partner,"" Pompeo told a televised news conference in the capital, Colombo. 
In contrast to India, which is locked in a military stand-off with China and was the first stop on Pompeo's trip, Sri Lanka is a close ally of Beijing. 
China has invested billions of dollars in Sri Lankan ports and highways as part of its Belt and Road Initiative of transport and energy links, a programme the United States believes is designed to trap smaller countries in debt.
Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said Sri Lanka wanted peace and good relations with all.
""Sri Lanka is a neutral, non-aligned country, committed to peace,"" Gunawardena told the told the news conference.

""We hope to continue with our relations with the United States and other countries.""

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A senior Chinese official accused the United States on Wednesday of deflecting blame and breaking its word when it comes to fighting climate change, as the simmering diplomatic row between the world's two biggest economies shifts to the environment.
The U.S. State Department said last month that China had showed ""willful disregard"" for air, land and water quality, and was putting global health at risk, with its climate-warming greenhouse gases the highest in the world and still rising. 
But Washington cannot make other countries take responsibility for its own environmental failures, said Li Gao, head of the climate change department at China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, during a news briefing. 
""The United States is the country with the most accumulated greenhouse gases, and at the start of next month will formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement,"" he said.
The row is part of a wider dispute between the two sides, with Beijing repeatedly accusing Washington of ""unilateralism"", bullying and failing to meet its global obligations while emphasising its own multilateralist credentials.
The United States began the three-year process to pull out of the Paris accord in 2017, with President Donald Trump saying the deal favoured China's firms and undermined the U.S. economy. 
But China's foreign ministry said last week that the United States was a ""consensus-breaker"" and ""troublemaker"" and had failed to honour its commitments to the international community.
CLEAR ADVANTAGES
After Trump accused Beijing of ""rampant pollution"" during a United Nations General Assembly meeting in late September, his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping vowed to steer his country towards ""carbon neutrality"" by 2060 and play a bigger role in combating climate change.
Experts have said that the country's carbon neutral pledge is part of an effort to build its reputation as a responsible global leader.
""Xi Jinping's announcement ... is a high level political decision. It is a very significant geopolitical consideration,"" said Li Shuo, climate advisor with environmental group Greenpeace.
China's diplomatic standing has been damaged by claims that its authoritarian political system led to a cover-up of the COVID-19 outbreak, allowing it to spread worldwide.
But Xie Zhenhua, special advisor to China's environment ministry, said the system has ""clear advantages"" over its rivals in the area of climate change. 
""Some countries find it difficult to implement,"" said Xie, who headed China's climate negotiating team until 2018. ""Why? Because they are electoral governments and can plan for only four or five years and after that, don't know whether they will still be in power."" 
""The United States for example: Obama committed to many targets which aren't being done once Trump came into power.""
However, critics of China's ""authoritarian environmentalism"" say it could still struggle to fulfill long-term climate goals. 

""In the absence of rule of law, authoritarian rulers have the final say, but their policy agenda continues to shift, which makes it difficult to sustain a coherent agenda on climate change,"" said Yanzhong Huang, author of Toxic Politics, which looks at China's environmental record.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 12:20AM ET</span>",Venezuela prosecutor arrests opposition coordinator,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's top prosecutor said on Tuesday opposition activist Roland Carreno had been arrested, hours after opposition leader Juan Guaido denounced what he called the ""forced disappearance"" of the Popular Will party's coordinator.
Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab wrote on Twitter that Carreno had been detained for alleged ""participation in conspirative plans against the democratic peace"" and his office had assigned a prosecutor to the case. 
Carreno was approached on Monday afternoon by unidentified people in vehicles without license plates, Popular Will said on Twitter. The party had been unable to confirm his location after that encounter, it added.
""He remains disappeared,"" Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled legislature, wrote in a separate post on Twitter. ""We alert the world about his forced disappearance and we hold the dictatorship responsible for his physical and mental integrity.""
Rights groups say the government of President Nicolas Maduro frequently arrests opposition adversaries, often without due process, and in some cases leaves them incommunicado for hours or days.
Venezuela's communications minister Freddy Nanez said he rejected the ""campaign to discredit Venezuela's rule of law"" in connection with Carreno's arrest. 
""In Venezuela, guarantees, due process and the right to defense are respected, without exception,"" Nanez wrote on Twitter.
Popular Will said it had been unable to locate two men who were with Carreno when he was last seen.
Carreno's disappearance comes days after Leopoldo Lopez, one of the founders of Popular Will, left the residence of the Spanish ambassador in Caracas, where he had taken refuge since April 2019 after escaping house arrest.
After Lopez's departure from the ambassador's residence, at least nine people were arrested. All Venezuelans, they included the residence's cook, two bodyguards and other employees.
Lawyers for the detainees said they were released between Sunday and Monday by the Sebin intelligence agency.

Lopez was detained in 2014 for leading anti-government protests. He was first held in a military prison and then at his residence in Caracas. He left the country over the weekend and traveled to Spain, where his family now lives.

SYDNEY/DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar expressed regret on Wednesday over the treatment of the female travellers after Australia said women on 10 flights underwent invasive physical searches following the discovery of an abandoned baby at the country's international airport.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, speaking about the issue for the first time, told reporters in Canberra that ""Australia's strong objections and views"" about the incident involving Australian travellers on October 2 were widely shared, without elaborating.
Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz Al Thani, has ordered an investigation into the incident, in which women were forced to disembark planes at Hamad International Airport and undergo an examination in ambulances.
A baby girl had earlier been found in a trash can at the airport, concealed in a plastic bag in what ""appeared to be a shocking and appalling attempt to kill her,"" the Qatari government's communications office said in a statement.
""While the aim of the urgently decided search was to prevent the perpetrators of the horrible crime from escaping, the State of Qatar regrets any distress or infringement on the personal freedoms of any traveler caused by this action,"" the statement said. The baby, whose mother has not been located, is safe and receiving medical care in Doha, it added.
Australian officials told a government committee hearing in Canberra on Wednesday that in addition to 18 women on a Qatar Airways flight to Sydney, another nine flights had been searched and Australia was working closely with other countries on the issue, without naming the countries.
""Other countries affected absolutely share Australia's views and the strength of Australia's views,"" said Frances Adamson, secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. ""This is not by any standard normal behaviour and the Qataris recognise that, are appalled by it, do not want it to happen again.""
Australia was notified of the incident by a female Australian diplomat who was on the flight and was ""shocked at what happened"", Adamson added. The Australian diplomat was not searched.
The results of the investigation will be shared with international partners, the Qatari statement said.
""The Qatari investigation is to determine which laws might have been violated, any individuals responsible, and recommend disciplinary and prosecutorial action where appropriate,"" a source with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters.
Human Rights Watch said in a statement Qatar should prohibit forced gynecological exams, and it was also concerned at the circumstances that may have led to a baby being abandoned. Sexual relations outside of wedlock are criminalised in Qatar, with hospitals required to report pregnant women to authorities.
Human Rights Watch senior researcher Rothna Begum said the alleged actions of Qatari authorities had ""failed many women – the unknown woman apparently forced to give birth in an airport toilet, unable to ask for assistance with her labour or on what to do with the baby, and the multiple women reportedly pulled off the plane for examinations"".

LONDON (Reuters) - A first-of-its-kind study using satellite images to count fresh graves and analyse burial activity in Yemen has estimated the death toll there from COVID-19 or COVID-related causes is far higher than official government figures suggest.
Using high-resolution satellite imagery, researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) analysed burial activity at all identifiable cemeteries in Yemen's Aden region and calculated an estimated 2,100 ""excess deaths"" during the COVID-19 outbreak between April and September.
""This total is best interpreted as the net sum of deaths due to COVID-19 infection and deaths indirectly attributable to the pandemic,"" they said. The indirect deaths would be those caused by disruptions to health services or by measures which may have caused problems accessing food, they added.
Humanitarian and global health experts had expected the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on Yemen to be severe, not least because the country's five-year conflict has disrupted already weak health services and led to overcrowding, food insecurity and shrinking humanitarian aid.
But as of 25 October 2020, Yemen, which reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case on April 10, had recorded only 2,064 infections with 600 deaths from the disease. 
No comment was immediately available from Yemen authorities on the satellite estimates but the internationally recognised government has said previously that it reports figures daily for areas under its control and nothing is hidden.
Francesco Checchi, who co-led the study, noted that having an accurate picture of COVID-19's impact ""is vital for effective government and humanitarian responses"".
""By estimating excess mortality, we aimed to develop a more accurate estimate of the toll of COVID-19 in Yemen,"" he said.
The researchers, whose findings have yet to be peer-reviewed by other experts, also cited other material as supporting their estimates. 
In May, videos posted on social media and information from informants reported high numbers of fresh graves, suggesting a spike in burial activity, they said, adding: ""The use of mechanical excavators in place of human gravediggers suggested that demand exceeded routine capacity.""
During the same period, the global medical charity Médecins sans Frontières reported a peak in hospital admissions, with a very high case-fatality ratio, and media said a shortage of personal protective equipment had forced several hospitals to close or reject patients with COVID-19-like symptoms. 
The research, funded by aid from the UK government, was led by LSHTM and the technology company Satellite Applications Catapult, which specialises in geospatial analysis. 
The researchers said they are now conducting a similar study in Mogadishu, Somalia.

""Though our method cannot distinguish direct from indirect virus deaths, estimating excess mortality attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in a humanitarian setting captures the whole system impact,"" said Emilie Koum Besson, who co-led the work.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",Analysis: Trump sanctions could give Biden a bargaining chip in deal talks with Iran,"By Timothy Gardner and Daphne Psaledakis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s imposition of new sanctions on Iran may have been intended to forestall a new nuclear deal with Tehran if Joe Biden is elected president, but it could backfire instead by strengthening Biden's hand at the bargaining table. 
The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday slapped counterterrorism sanctions on key players in Iran's oil sector for supporting the Quds Force, the elite paramilitary arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The move, just before the Nov. 3 U.S. election, followed sanctions on 18 banks in Iran that Washington imposed earlier this month.
Biden supports returning to diplomacy with Iran if it comes into compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal Washington struck with Tehran and five other world powers. Doing that could eventually add some 2 million barrels per day of Iranian oil to world markets that had been cinched off by President Donald Trump’s wider unilateral sanctions on the OPEC member. 
Analysts have said Monday's action was among moves by the Trump administration attempting to make it harder for a potential Biden White House to lift sanctions.
""It seems clear that one of the primary reasons for yesterday's action was to try to make it more difficult for a potential next administration to go back into the JCPOA,"" said Peter Harrell, a former State Department official and supporter of Biden, referring to the nuclear deal.
While Biden could remove Trump's new sanctions by executive order, he would pay a price. 
""The new sanctions do not create a legal barrier to relieving sanctions under Biden,"" said Henry Rome, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy.
Still, the new sanctions could ""provide ammunition to congressional critics,"" who might say a Biden administration was glossing over Iran's support for terrorism if it sought a new deal with Tehran, Rome said. 
It could also create added paperwork and bureaucratic process to unwind the raft of sanctions, making the effort marginally more difficult, experts said.
But Monday's sanctions could also offer Biden collateral when cutting an eventual deal, said Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners. 
""Biden can blame Trump for the strictures he put in place even as he offers their elimination as a source of goodwill during negotiations,"" with Iran, Book said.
Tristan Abbey, a former aide to Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski who worked at the national security council in the Trump White House, agreed. ""A cynic would say it's more stuff they can barter away in a deal,” said Abbey, now president of Comarus Analytics. 
The White House did not comment. Neither did the Biden campaign.
Trump left the JCPOA deal in 2018, saying it did not do enough to curb the Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and militant influence across the Middle East. 
LITTLE LEFT TO DO ON SANCTIONS
The prospect of Biden getting to a new deal with Tehran if elected was already going to be a lengthy endeavor involving many months at least of multilateral talks. 
The negotiations would likely come only after Iran takes steps on its nuclear program including downblending stocks of enriched uranium that have built up during the Trump administration, an action that would have to be verified by U.N.inspectors. 
The U.S. Treasury on Monday blacklisted Iran's Ministry of Petroleum, the National Iranian Oil Company and the National Iranian Tanker Company alongside other individuals and entities. The move freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. 
At least two of the entities, NIOC and NITC, had already been sanctioned under different legal authorities, as the Trump administration carried out its ""maximum pressure"" policy on Iran.
Alireza Miryousefi, the spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations, pointed to the duplication as over reliance on sanctions by the Trump administration.
""The U.S. is sanctioning Iranian entities that have already been sanctioned under other phony charges,"" he said in a statement. ""However, the U.S.' addiction to sanctions has not paid off as (the) U.S. national security adviser admitted ... the U.S. has out-sanctioned itself."" 
Miryousefi was referring to comments by Trump's national security adviser Robert O'Brien, who spoke over the weekend to reporters about the difficulties of using sanctions to stop meddling in U.S. elections. 
""One of the problems that we have with both Iran and Russia is that we have so many sanctions out on those countries right now that there’s very little left for us to do,"" O'Brien said. Washington was ""looking at every potential deterrent"" to stop the meddling,"" he said.
While the Trump administration is seeking to tie the hands of its successor on Iran, according to Harrell, now a sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security, it is not clear if it will succeed.

""Legally, there's no reason another administration couldn't undo these sanctions, so it's fundamentally a call about has this changed the political calculus in some way,"" he said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Tuesday the United States is effectively lifting a ban on U.S. funding of Israeli scientific research projects conducted in the West Bank and Golan Heights, areas Israel occupied in a 1967 war.
There was no immediate Palestinian comment on the move, announced a week before a U.S. presidential election in which opinion polls show incumbent Donald Trump, hailed by Israel as one of its staunchest allies, trailing Democrat Joe Biden.
Past scientific accords with the U.S. government stipulated that Israeli research projects receiving U.S. grants could not be carried out in areas that came under Israeli administration in the 1967 conflict.
The Trump administration last year effectively backed Israel's right to build West Bank settlements by abandoning a long-held U.S. position that they were ""inconsistent with international law"".
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the U.S. ambassador to Israel will sign amended scientific cooperation agreements at a ""special ceremony"" in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank on Wednesday, Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
The revised agreements ""will expand scientific cooperation between Israel and the United States to Judea and Samaria and the Golan Heights,"" the Israeli statement said, using the biblical names for the West Bank.
Palestinians seek a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem and along with many countries consider the settlements illegal.
Under a peace blueprint that Trump announced in January and which Palestinians rejected as biased towards Israel, Israel would retain control of most of its West Bank settlements.
In May, Trump recognised Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured from Syria. He has also challenged international consensus by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the U.S. Embassy to the holy city.

Lopez arrived in Madrid on Sunday after spending the past year at the Spanish ambassador's residence in Venezuela to escape house arrest. 
""Being in Spain allows me to take our cause to other parts of the world. I'm here to work, to confront the dictatorship, to carry the voice of those who cannot speak up because they are in Venezuela,"" he said, promising to seek international sanctions against those responsible for human rights violations.
He met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez earlier on Tuesday and said Sanchez was supportive of his cause, but many countries around the world remained to be convinced. Sanchez's Socialist party said in a tweet only that it supported a peaceful, political solution in Venezuela. 
""Unity is one of our main challenges ... not just at home. We also ask all countries to unite for the sake of liberty in Venezuela,"" Lopez said.
He said he was willing to go ""wherever we need to go to promote"" the opposition's push for free presidential elections, bring those responsible for human rights violations to international justice and alleviate the suffering of common Venezuelans in a humanitarian crisis.
Lopez declined to say how he fled Venezuela in order not to expose those who helped him and to preserve escape channels for those who may still need them. ""Only five people knew, not even my wife knew about my leaving,"" he said.

Lopez was jailed in 2014 for leading violent protests against Maduro, and was released to house arrest in 2017. From his Caracas home, he was a mentor to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who early last year invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency and began a campaign to unseat Maduro.

The statement from the presidency carried on Algerian state media did not specify if Abdelmadjid Tebboune had tested positive for the coronavirus, but said his condition was stable and did not warrant any concern and that he was still working. 
Tebboune, 75, said on Saturday he was self isolating after several senior aides tested positive for the coronavirus. ""I assure you, my brothers and sisters, that I am well and healthy and that I continue my work,"" he was quoted as saying then. 
If his illness is confirmed as COVID-19, he would be among a small group of world leaders to have fallen sick from the disease including U.S. President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. 
Tebboune's hospitalisation comes at a critical moment in his efforts to turn a page on last year's massive street protests that forced his predecessor Abdelaziz Bouteflika from power after 20 years. 
Elected in December, Tebboune has pushed for a new constitution that limits presidential terms and gives more powers to the parliament and judiciary. It will be put to a referendum on Sunday. 
The global pandemic struck Algeria's economy as it faced long-term challenges posed by the decline of the oil and gas revenues that finance its historically lavish state spending.

So far, Algeria has officially confirmed more than 55,000 cases of the coronavirus with nearly 2,000 deaths.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Tuesday dismissed calls from opposition parties to resign at a parliament session he had called to discuss months of protests demanding his departure and reforms to the powerful monarchy.
""I will not run away from problems. I will not leave my duty by resigning at a time when the country has problems,"" the former army ruler told the assembly, whose entire upper house was picked by his old junta.
Protests that have brought tens of thousands of people to the streets since mid-July are the biggest challenge in years to an establishment that has long been dominated by military men close to the Royal Palace.
King Maha Vajiralongkorn's Palace has made no comment since the start of protests that have smashed a taboo on criticising the monarchy.
Opposition members of parliament told Prayuth to stop hiding behind proclamations of loyalty to the monarchy and step down. His critics say he engineered last year's elections to keep power he seized in 2014. He says the ballot was fair.
One of the protest leaders, Tattep “Ford” Ruangprapaikitseree, dismissed the parliament session as ""useless"". 
Prayuth said he had agreed to set up committees to study the problems, but referring to the protesters, he said: ""I don’t know whom I should talk to as there are no leaders. They are all leaders.""
Some of the highest profile leaders are among dozens of people arrested this month in a crackdown under a week of emergency measures that were called off after they sparked much bigger protests.
Shows of support by royalists have so far been far smaller than those of anti-government protesters.
More than 1,000 gathered in yellow shirts in a central Bangkok park on Tuesday.
""We want to show support and encouragement to his majesty,"" said Thatchapan Boriphet, 57. ""I am neutral politically but I cannot stand it when there is a violation of the monarchy.""
The prime minister's office shared an image of the demonstration on Twitter.

Protesters have accused the king of political involvement and marched to the German embassy on Monday to seek an inquiry into whether he exercised his powers during long stays in Germany, something Berlin has said would be unacceptable.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Armenia and Azerbaijan to pursue a diplomatic solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict as fighting in and around the mountain enclave entered a second month on Tuesday, defying a ceasefire brokered in Washington.
Armenia acknowledged overnight that Nagorno-Karabakh forces had withdrawn from a strategic town between the enclave and the Iranian border, an apparent military gain for Azerbaijan.
Both sides accused each other on Tuesday of striking targets outside Nagorno-Karabakh itself in defiance of a truce brokered by Pompeo at the weekend.
Pompeo, in India on Tuesday, spoke separately with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azeri President Ilham Aliyev and ""pressed the leaders to abide by their commitments to cease hostilities and pursue a diplomatic solution"", the State Department said.
World powers want to prevent a wider war that might suck in Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia. The conflict is also close to pipelines that carry oil and gas from Azerbaijan to international markets.
Azerbaijan's military gains could make a diplomatic solution more difficult: it rejects any solution that would leave Armenians in control of an enclave that is part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.
Armenia says it will not withdraw from territory it views as part of its historic homeland and where the population needs protection.
The ethnic Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry said its military had recorded 1,009 deaths since the fighting erupted on Sept. 27. Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military casualties. Russia has estimated as many as 5,000 people have been killed.
Armenian Defence Ministry official Artsrun Hovhannisyan said in a news conference late on Monday that ethnic Armenian forces had given up the settlement of Gubadli south of Nagorno-Karabakh ""to avoid unnecessary losses"", but the situation was ""not critical"".
CEASEFIRE BROKEN
The two countries agreed to a ceasefire on Sunday when their foreign ministers separately met Pompeo in Washington. But the truce, like two previous ceasefires brokered by Russia, has had little impact on the ground.
Localised battles were taking place along several parts of the front line on Tuesday, the Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry said in a statement. Azerbaijan's defence ministry described fighting concentrated in three frontline areas.
Shushan Stepanyan, spokeswoman for Armenia's defence ministry, said Azerbaijan had used drones to attack frontier posts near the country's southern border with Iran.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry denied this and said in a statement that Armenia had fired mortars in the direction of the village of Aghband in Zangilan region, east of Nagorno-Karabakh and inside Azeri territory, also near the Iranian border.
Azerbaijan later reported four civilian deaths after shelling in the village of Garayusifli, miles from the conflict zone in the Barda region of central Azerbaijan. Stepanyan, the Armenian defence spokeswoman, denied this.
Iran's foreign ministry said on Twitter that Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi would travel to several countries to discuss the crisis. Iranian media said he would visit Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Russia.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, discussed Nagorno-Karabakh in a phone call. Moscow said they discussed an immediate ceasefire.

The OSCE Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, is scheduled to meet the Armenian and Azeri foreign ministers in Geneva on Oct. 29. Turkey has demanded a bigger role in the mediating body.

TUNIS (Reuters) - The United Nations acting Libya envoy expects coming political talks to designate a date for national elections, she told Reuters on Tuesday, after the country's two warring sides agreed a ceasefire last week. 
""What resonates is a clear and direct desire for there to be elections in as rapid a timeframe as possible,"" Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) said. 
Libya has been split since 2014 between factions based in the capital Tripoli, in the west, and in the city of Benghazi, in the east. 
Last week a truce was agreed in Geneva by the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognised by the United Nations, and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA). 
Previous ceasefires have collapsed and earlier efforts to agree a wider political settlement have run aground. Both sides contain groups that compete with each other and are backed by foreign states that have breached a U.N. arms embargo. 
The political talks have started online and will move to Tunis on Nov. 9. The United Nations has said it is imperative to agree on arrangements to hold elections as soon as possible, including by forming a new unified leadership to oversee them.
""Whatever executive authority they agree on really needs to have a clear focus - preparing for the elections,"" Williams said. ""I do fully expect there to be a date designated for elections.""
Williams said she was hopeful for the talks, citing a recent lack of fighting, progress in ending an eight-month oil blockade and reopening internal transport routes, and involvement of figures from across Libya's political spectrum. 
""We have learned from previous political processes not to exclude any political constituency and so in this dialogue you do also have representation from the previous regime,"" she said. 
""That's why I'm much more optimistic because I think there's more buy in.""
Some Libyans have been critical of the list of 75 delegates invited to the political talks, arguing they are not representative of the country as a whole. 
Williams said it was important to make sure the relevant political forces active on the ground were ""around the table"" but also include representatives from other parts of society. 
She acknowledged some in Libya's political class may seek to block progress but said ""they are increasingly in a minority"", citing protests in Tripoli and Benghazi this summer over corruption and poor services. 
Foreign countries involved in the conflict may pose a risk to peace talks too. 

""I hope we hear more voices in the international community pushing, pressuring both the internal and external actors to take advantage of this very positive dynamic,"" Williams said.

Independent investigations were a core demand of protesters who successfully demanded the end of a widely feared police branch called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). 
The demonstrations turned violent on Oct. 20 when witnesses said the military opened fire on peaceful protesters. The army said it was not there. 
Authorities said at least 13 states have established judicial panels. 
The Lagos panel has yet to receive complaints from the shooting. Chair Justice Doris Okuwobi said it would fully investigate it but declined to say when. 
On Tuesday, Okoliagu Abudike, a father of five, sought justice for what he said was a 47-day detention in 2012 at the hands of SARS officers that came after his boss accused him of theft. 
He said he bled profusely and lost two teeth as officers beat and tortured him, demanding he confess, and later took his car, generator and the deed to his house.
""My boss then told me that I was going to die there,"" he said. 
Despite a 2016 court ruling awarding him 10 million naira (more than $26,000), he said SARS paid nothing and did not discipline the officers. 
After about 30 minutes of testimony and questions, the eight-member panel said it would rule on Abudike's case within 7-10 days. The day's other cases were postponed. The panel will sit for six months. 
The panel includes two youth representatives who were part of the protests, but both declined to speak with media following the hearings. 
Tensions remain high across Nigeria, with sporadic shooting in parts of Lagos and looting nationwide, particularly of warehouses holding food meant to assuage the impact of COVID-19 on the poor.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",American citizen kidnapped by gunmen in southern Niger,"By Boureima Balima and David Lewis
NIAMEY (Reuters) - Six gunmen on motorbikes with AK47 assault rifles kidnapped an American man from his home on the edge of a rural village in southern Niger in the early hours of Tuesday, multiple sources said.
The kidnappers seized 27-year-old Phillip Walton, who kept camels, sheep and poultry and grew mango trees near the border with Nigeria, at around 0145 local time (0045 GMT), a police source, two local officials and three security sources told Reuters.
His wife, young daughter and his brother were left behind in their home in the village, called Massalata, the police source said. 
Niger, like much of West Africa's Sahel region, is struggling with a deepening security crisis as groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State carry out attacks on the army and civilians, despite help from French and U.S. forces.
Four U.S. soldiers were killed in an ambush there in 2017, sparking a debate about America's role in the sparsely populated West African desert that is home to some of the world's poorest countries. 
Walton does not work for the U.S. government or any U.S.-linked organisation, the sources said. 
He has been living in Massalata for less than a year, said Ibrahim Abba Lele, prefect for the nearby town of Birnin Konni. He often walked his camels into the surrounding bush, Lele said.
""They were so exposed that he was abducted without anyone knowing,"" he told Reuters. 
A Niger security source said aircraft were dispatched to look for the kidnappers. U.S. and Nigerien officials did not respond to requests for comment.
The police source said that the perpetrators appeared to be from the fulani ethnic group and they spoke Hausa and some English. They asked for money and searched the house before leaving with Walton. 
The rest of the family was tied up so they could not inform the authorities, Lele told Reuters, though the police source said that the family were not threatened. Authorities believe that he has been taken over the border into Nigeria, Lele said.
Attacks in Niger have generally been restricted to a western zone bordering Mali and Burkina Faso, but there have been signs of encroachment this year. 
In August, gunmen killed six French aid workers, a Nigerian guide and a driver in a giraffe reserve just 65 km (40 miles) from the capital Niamey.
Massalata is a few hundred miles to the east of that region. It is also hundreds of miles from a corner of south east Niger that has come under attack from Boko Haram militants based in Nigeria. 
At least six foreign hostages are being held by Islamist insurgents in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Islamists have collected millions of dollars in ransom payments in recent year. The U.S. government has frequently criticised other countries for paying.

Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad made his comments ahead of flying to Doha to meet with the two sides.
""I return to the region disappointed that despite commitments to lower violence, it has not happened. The window to achieve a political settlement will not stay open forever,"" he said in a tweet.
The talks between a government delegation and the delegation have been going on in Doha since mid-September but progress has been slow and diplomats and officials have warned that rising violence back home is sapping trust.
The two sides are often at odds on even the most basic issues.
""The sides must move past procedure and into substantive negotiations,"" said Khalilzad's office in a statement on Tuesday.
There needeed to be ""an agreement on a reduction of violence leading to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire,"" he said.
Last week, Khalilzad said he had struck an agreement with the Taliban to ""re-set"" their commitments under a troop withdrawal deal and reduce the number of casualties in the conflict. 
The deal in February between the United States and the Taliban paved the way for foreign forces to leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counter-terrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and a power-sharing formula with the Afghan government. 

The intra-Afghan talks have taken on increased significance against the backdrop of the U.S election, with President Donald Trump keen to end the nearly two decade-long U.S. war in Afghanistan and see U.S. troops home by Christmas - well ahead of the proposed withdrawal timeline.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",Nigerian judge throws out case against 47 men facing homosexuality charge,"By Alexis Akwagyiram
LAGOS (Reuters) - A judge in a Nigerian court on Tuesday threw out a case against 47 men charged with public displays of affection with members of same sex, ending what had widely been seen as a test of the country's laws banning homosexual relationships. 
The Nigerian law banning gay marriage, punishable by up to 14 years in prison, and same-sex ""amorous relationships"", prompted an international outcry when it came into force under former President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014. 
The men were arrested in a police raid on a Lagos hotel in the city's Egbeda district in 2018. Police said the men were being initiated into a gay club, but the defendants said they were attending a birthday party.
Prosecution and defence lawyers in the case had told Reuters nobody had yet been convicted under the law, which led to the case of the men being widely seen as a test case that could help to establish the burden of proof. 
Prosecutors failed to attend Tuesday's hearing at the federal high court in Lagos, having previously failed to present some of their witnesses in a case that had been adjourned on several occasions.
Justice Rilwan Aikawa struck out the case and said he had done so due to the ""lack of diligent prosecution"".
The specific charge the men faced, relating to public displays of affection, carries a 10-year prison sentence. 
Outside the court, many of the men smiled and cheered, including dancer James Brown who, smiling, said: ""I am free. It means a lot of good things."" 
Under Nigerian law, defendants in a case that is struck out can be re-arrested and arraigned again on the same charge, whereas that is not possible in cases that have been dismissed. 
Taxi driver Onyeka Oguaghamba, a father-of-four who said he merely drove people to the party, said he was happy the case had been struck out but disappointed that it was not dismissed entirely. 
""I am not happy, because I'm looking for the matter to end in a way that people will see me and believe what I have been saying from the beginning,"" he said, adding that the decision meant he could be charged again. 
Oguaghamba and others previously told Reuters they had been stigmatized as a result of the raid and a televised news conference held by police in which they were identified the day after their arrest.
Chris Agiriga, another of the men, said the striking out of the case would not help him to be reconciled with his family who had rejected him over the matter.
""Since the past two years, this has caused a lot of damage in my life,"" he said. 
Emmanuel Sadi, a programme officer with rights group the Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERS), said the outcome of the case raised questions about the law used to charge the men.
""You can't even build a case around it,"" he said. ""I hope they (the government) realise how redundant it is as a law, and they are open to removing or repealing it,"" he said. 

Homosexuality is outlawed in many socially conservative African societies where some religious groups brand it a corrupting Western import. Gay sex is a crime in countries across the continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Turkish court sentences U.S. consulate employee over aiding terrorist organisation,"By Ali Kucukgocmen
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - An Istanbul court on Tuesday sentenced a local U.S. consulate employee to jail for aiding the network Ankara accuses of attempting a 2016 coup, in a verdict that could further strain ties between Turkey and the United States.
Nazmi Mete Canturk, a Turkish security officer at the Istanbul consulate, was ordered to be jailed for five years and two months. The court did not arrest Canturk, meaning he will be free pending appeal.
Trials of U.S. citizens and consulate workers in Turkey have been among many sources of discord between the NATO allies, whose ties have deteriorated over differences in policy in Syria and Ankara's purchase of a Russian missile defence system.
Concerns over their relationship came into the spotlight in recent weeks as Turkey tested the S-400 missile system, prompting a furious response from Washington.
In his final defence on Tuesday, Canturk denied being a follower of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Turkey for the failed 2016 coup, and said his job required coordinating with local officials on security issues.
""Upon my manager's orders, I met people I needed to meet as part of my job. The people in these positions are civil servants appointed by the government,"" he said. ""It is not possible for me to know if these people were involved in a crime,” he said, his voice shaking as he teared up at one point.
His wife Sevim and daughter Irem, also charged with membership of a terrorist organisation, were acquitted.
They said they had initially been detained because police could not find Mete Canturk and were held for nine days. They said they were told they were not involved with the investigation but were later charged along with him.
Officials say followers of Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, infiltrated the police, judiciary, military and other institutions. Turkey considers the network to be a terrorist organisation. Gulen has denied any involvement in the coup attempt.
Canturk is the third U.S. consulate worker to be convicted. Hamza Ulucay was sentenced to 4-1/2 years in prison on terrorism charges. Metin Topuz, a translator for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration at the consulate in Istanbul, was sentenced in June to nearly nine years in jail for aiding Gulen's network.
Analysts say the relationship between Ankara and Washington could be further strained if Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate and front-runner wins the U.S. presidential election on November 3.
Such concerns, on top other geopolitical issues, have led to a sharp decline in the Turkish lira, which has repeatedly hit new record weak levels in recent months. 
The currency weakened further after the court's decision, from 8.1810 to the dollar to as far as 8.1975 at 1442 GMT, before regaining some ground.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Head down, arms spread, one man pushes with all his strength against rows of Thai riot police behind their shields.
The Reuters image of the night of Oct. 16, when police tried to use force to disperse protesters, has become one of the most widely published of months of demonstrations to call for the ousting of the government and reforms to the powerful monarchy.
For the man in the picture, Anurak Jeantawanich, 52, it was the moment when he tried to stop them.
""I could sense danger coming,"" he told Reuters.
Having witnessed a bloody crackdown on ""red shirt"" anti-establishment protests a decade ago, he had more experience than many of the youth protesters as he crouched beside them facing riot police and water cannon behind a barricade of colourful umbrellas.
Anurak heard police counting down. On three, he jumped out to face them, he said. 
""I looked each of them in the eye and told them not to come any closer, that there were a lot of young students and girls,"" Anurak said.
Seconds later, police started firing what they have described as water containing chemicals that cause skin irritation, which went over his head and directly at protesters behind him. 
""I rushed to push back against them,"" he said. ""There was no fear in my heart. If my daughter was behind me, so were the sons and daughters of other people."" 
Police pushed. Anurak fell back. He described being yanked off his feet and ""crowd-surfed like in concerts"" by rows of police, before being cuffed with cable-ties and put into a police wagon.
From inside the vehicle, he said he heard water cannon being fired and shouts from protesters, some of whom scattered before the protest was halted for the day.
A Thai police spokesman said they had only used internationally accepted methods for countering the protest.
The images of that night stirred greater anger and brought much bigger protests until Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha last weekend ordered a stop to emergency measures he had imposed on Oct. 15.
Anurak, an activist who sells political T-shirts and other items, was among those arrested for violating the emergency measures. He spent a night at a regional police unit before a court dismissed the police petition for his detention and he was freed.
He would not hesitate to do the same again, he said.

""If I had to risk my life to protect the young people and for our victory, I'd do it. It would be worth it,"" he said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called on Tuesday for an end to mass protests over abortion rights, saying those attending were disregarding ""massive risks"" from the resurgent coronavirus pandemic.
Five days of nationwide protests have followed a ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal last week that amounts to a near-total ban on abortion in the predominantly Catholic nation.
Once the decision goes into effect, pregnancy termination will only be legal in Poland in the case of incest, rape or a threat to the mother's health. The court said abortion due to foetal abnormalities, the only other case for legal termination in Poland until now, was unconstitutional.
""These outbursts we are seeing in the streets should absolutely not be taking place. We will oppose any acts of aggression decisively,"" Morawiecki said.
He said his conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government would ensure mothers and their children born despite health problems would be taken care of and helped to ""live a normal life"".
Protests have focused in part on concerns women would be forced to carry to term pregnancies with severe genetic disorders likely to result in the baby's death during labour or shortly after.
They have taken place across the country in defiance of restrictions imposed to curb mounting COVID-19 cases. On Tuesday, Poland hit a new record of 16,300 reported new infections.
No nationwide protests were scheduled on Tuesday. 
But scuffles erupted in parliament, with opposition lawmakers surrounding PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, carrying signs reading ""This is war"", ""Shame"" and ""Legal abortion"". 
""LEFT-WING FASCISM""
Kaczynski and PiS appear to have been taken by surprise by the intensity of the protests, which have also fuelled an unusually fierce backlash against the Roman Catholic Church in Poland. The clergy are seen as having close links with the nationalist PiS and its ultra-conservative allies in parliament.
PiS came to power five years ago on a promise to instil more traditional values in public life, and has attracted widespread criticism at home and abroad over a crackdown on LGBT rights and campaign rhetoric opponents say foments homophobia.
The European Commission has said a PiS overhaul of the judiciary, which the party says aims to make the system more effective and fair, amounts to a subversion of democratic norms because it has politicized courts.
The party has also been criticised for wielding significant control over state media, notably broadcaster TVP, which ran a news ticker on Tuesday saying ""Left-wing fascism is destroying Poland"" and ""The opposition seeks anarchy because it lost elections"".

Abortion has further polarised Poland, which is already riven by conflicts over western liberal values, which PiS says are undermining traditional society.

PHETCHABUN, Thailand (Reuters) - Thai online retailer Kanittha Thongnak has captured a market of thousands by dressing up as a zombie to sell the clothes of dead people in sales streamed live on social media. 
Kanittha, 32, saw her audience numbers surge after she started appearing in scary make-up, taking up to three hours to complete her zombie look before each late-night session, during which she tells buyers exactly how the owners of each item died. 
""All the clothes belong to dead people who died from different causes,"" Kanittha told Reuters while preparing for her weekly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live session at her home in Phetchabun, northern Thailand.
""Since I started to wear scary make-up, the audience increased to five or six thousand."" 
The sales tap into a fascination among many Thais in horror films and ghosts and a common belief in spirits, with the zombie presentation generating interest in items sold at relatively low prices, including brand names.
Kanittha, who learned the make-up skills on the internet, sells clothing items for anything up to 100 baht ($3.2). She first got the idea while attending a funeral, where she saw clothes of the deceased burned, in accordance with tradition. 
Kanittha sources the clothing from funeral directors after monks give prayers for the dead. She donates part of her income from the sales to Buddhist temples.
""I bought the clothes before, including the one I'm wearing now,"" said Anu Kaewsom, one of Kanittha's most loyal customers, who also buys for her husband.
""It's like normal clothes,"" she said, when asked how it felt to wear clothes of the dead. 
Kanittha also sells handmade scary-themed items, including zombie dolls, and she finds some people are much keener than others. 

""It depends on customers whether they want to buy the clothes or not. If they want to buy, they will buy it and they don't get scared,"" she said.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>",Elaborate Somali insurgent tax system collects almost as much as government,"By Katharine Houreld
NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Somali insurgent group al Shabaab collects almost as much tax as the government through a sophisticated system of levies on activities from importing goods to irrigating crops, a think tank report has found.
The Mogadishu-based Hiraal Institute said al Shabaab's tax collectors were bringing in an estimated $15 million per month. Its report was based on more than 70 interviews with businessmen, government officials, al Shabaab defectors and active members of the insurgents' tax collection cell.
It examined receipts and income reports from religious taxes and fees charged on activities such as crossing checkpoints, running businesses, irrigating or selling land, or exporting or importing goods.
One senior Somali military commander told Hiraal that he had to pay the insurgency $3,600 in taxes to finish building his house. The first contractor he had hired quit after al Shabaab threatened him because the commander had not paid taxes.
The second contractor stopped work for the same reason. Even trucks carrying his construction materials would not move, the commander said, until he made his payment. 
Hussein Sheikh Ali, Somalia's former national security advisor and founder of Hiraal, said the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab's tax collection had grown more efficient since the think tank published a first report on the militants' finances two years ago. 
""These people are really into the business of money-making,"" he told Reuters. That did not mean they are corrupt, he said. 
""They are strategic, they are serious, and they will look for ways to weaken their adversaries - the Somali authorities.""
Hiraal's report comes in advance of a United Nations report expected to say al Shabaab is generating a significant cash surplus and moving millions of dollars through the formal banking system.
""This is an area that the panel prioritises and will continue to investigate,"" Natascha Hryckow, the head of the U.N. sanctions panel on Somalia, told Reuters. 
Much of al Shabaab's revenue comes from ports, said Hiraal's executive director Mohamed Mubarak, especially Mogadishu, where militants tax shipping containers the same way the government does. 
Another big revenue stream is zakat, an annual religious tax of 2.5% of an individual's wealth, Ali said. 
Al Shabaab is extremely adaptive, Ali said, and is following the government in adopting new taxes in areas such as healthcare or education.
""They're kind of learning,"" Ali told Reuters. ""If (Finance) Minister Beileh gets a new taxation bracket for a business, Shabab will say aha, we will also tax this one.""
The insurgency often calls and questions business entities such as the Chamber of Commerce, or government agencies responsible for particular brackets of taxation, he said. 
The Chamber of Commerce declined to comment. 
""Please don't ask me for comment,"" said a representative who declined to be named. ""People get killed (for this)."" 
Somalia's Finance Ministry also did not respond to requests for comment. The federal government raised $230 million in domestic revenues last year.

A senior Somali counter-terrorism official told Reuters that the insurgency was probably collecting millions per month but that it was hard to get the full picture.

On the second day of the strike she has said will paralyse the country, Tsikhanouskaya said employees at a string of major companies were refusing to work their shifts but coming under ""colossal pressure"" from the authorities.
Eleven weeks after running against Lukashenko in a presidential election that the opposition and Western governments say was rigged, Tsikhanouskaya - who fled to Lithuania after the vote - is facing a critical test of her ability to mobilise popular support.
""If we help the factories go on strike, they will help us finish what we started,"" she said on social media. ""Remember: every active peaceful step brings us closer to ending the violence, winning freedom for political prisoners and finally holding new, fair elections.""
Photos and video posted on Twitter showed protests at several universities. But the opposition's strike calls have so far failed to shut down state enterprises in the former Soviet republic of 9.5 million people.
Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko said the situation was ""absolutely calm"", and attacked what he called ""direct appeals to cause harm to our country"".
A representative of heavy vehicle manufacturer MZKT, contacted by Reuters, said: ""We have no strikes here. Everything is fine, we're all working.""
Lukashenko, in power since 1994 and drawing on support from his key ally, Russia, ignored an ultimatum from Tsikhanouskaya to step down by Sunday and since then has stepped up his rhetoric against the opposition.
The official news agency Belta quoted him as saying that some people had become radicalised and ""crossed the red line"" in recent days.
""What has been launched against us is not an information war but a terrorist war on separate fronts. We must stop it,"" he said.
The interior ministry said more than 500 people had been arrested at anti-government protests on Monday, the first day of the strike. Some 16,000 have been detained during protests since the disputed Aug. 9 election.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police on Tuesday detained three people under the city's contentious national security law on suspicion of publishing content to incite others to secede from China. 
Police said two men and a woman, aged between 17 and 21, were in custody and an investigation was under way. 
Authorities did not name the suspects but pro-independence group Studentlocalism said three of its members, including Tony Chung, a former leader of the organisation, were among them.
The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and has been rocked by pro-democracy demonstrations in recent years.
Beijing imposed a national security law on its freest city on June 30, a move widely condemned by Western governments and human rights groups. The law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Chung was taken away from a coffee shop close to the U.S. consulate by unidentified men, local media reported, adding that he was believed to be preparing to make an asylum application. The U.S. consulate did not respond to a request for comment.
Like other anti-government organisations, Studentlocalism disbanded before, Studentlocalism disbanded before Beijing imposed the national security law.
China considers Hong Kong to be an ""inalienable"" part of the country, so calls for independence are anathema to Beijing’s Communist Party leaders.
Chung had been free on bail after being initially arrested under the national security law in July on suspicion of being involved in an organisation that vowed to fight for an independent Hong Kong.
Twenty-eight people have been arrested under the new legislation, according to a police post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 

Critics of the legislation say it represents the latest move by Beijing to tighten its grip over the former British colony and erode its judicial independence.

Hathloul's sister Lina told Reuters that the main demand was to be allowed regular contact with her family. In late August Hathloul went on a six-day hunger strike after authorities at Riyadh's al-Hair prison cut off contact for over four months.
Hathloul, 31, who was arrested along with at last a dozen other women's rights activists, had since March only been permitted limited contact with her family, her sister said, including a March 23 visit, a phone call on April 19 and a visit on Aug 31.
Her parents were allowed to see her on Monday.
""Yesterday during the visit Loujain told (our parents) she is exhausted of being mistreated and deprived from hearing her family's voices,"" Lina al-Hathloul said. ""She told them she will start a hunger strike starting yesterday evening until they allow her regular calls again.""
The Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The case has drawn global criticism and provoked anger in European capitals and the U.S. Congress following the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate. 
Saudi Arabia temporarily freed some of the women's rights activists who were rounded up as part of a broader crackdown on dissent, while others remain detained as sporadic closed-court sessions continue.
Rights group say at least three of the women, including Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement for months and subjected to abuse including electric shocks, flogging and sexual assault.
Saudi officials have denied torture allegations and said the arrests were made on suspicion of harming Saudi interests and offering support to hostile elements abroad. Few charges have been made public.
Charges against Hathloul include communicating with 15 to 20 foreign journalists in Saudi Arabia, attempting to apply for a job at the United Nations, and attending digital privacy training, her brother has said.

Hathloul's sister Lina told Reuters that the main demand was to be allowed regular contact with her family. In late August Hathloul went on a six-day hunger strike after authorities at Riyadh's al-Hair prison cut off contact for over four months.
Hathloul, 31, who was arrested along with at last a dozen other women's rights activists, had since March only been permitted limited contact with her family, her sister said, including a March 23 visit, a phone call on April 19 and a visit on Aug 31.
Her parents were allowed to see her on Monday.
""Yesterday during the visit Loujain told (our parents) she is exhausted of being mistreated and deprived from hearing her family's voices,"" Lina al-Hathloul said. ""She told them she will start a hunger strike starting yesterday evening until they allow her regular calls again.""
The Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The case has drawn global criticism and provoked anger in European capitals and the U.S. Congress following the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate. 
Saudi Arabia temporarily freed some of the women's rights activists who were rounded up as part of a broader crackdown on dissent, while others remain detained as sporadic closed-court sessions continue.
Rights group say at least three of the women, including Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement for months and subjected to abuse including electric shocks, flogging and sexual assault.
Saudi officials have denied torture allegations and said the arrests were made on suspicion of harming Saudi interests and offering support to hostile elements abroad. Few charges have been made public.
Charges against Hathloul include communicating with 15 to 20 foreign journalists in Saudi Arabia, attempting to apply for a job at the United Nations, and attending digital privacy training, her brother has said.

Scores of other activists, intellectuals and clerics have been arrested separately in recent years in an apparent bid to stamp out possible opposition, even as de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pushes reforms to open up the kingdom.

Emergency and medical crews attended the scene, along with a French Navy helicopter.
Several thousand migrants have attempted the dangerous crossing of the English Channel this year, often paying people traffickers to help them through one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes in overloaded rubber dinghies.

The cartoons have become a focus of controversy after an 18-year-old student of Chechen origin beheaded a teacher for showing the images to his pupils as part of a civics lesson.
France has allowed displays of the cartoons, which are considered blasphemous by Muslims. In some Muslim countries, politicians and other figures have made rhetorical attacks on French leaders, accusing them of being anti-Islam and calling for a boycott of French products.
The head of the French Council for the Muslim Faith, Mohammed Moussaoui, reminded worshippers that such caricatures were allowed under French law.
""This same law doesn't force anyone to like them nor does it forbid anybody from hating them,"" he said in a statement.
Moussaoui suggested Muslims should follow the example of the Prophet Mohammad, who, according to Islamic tradition, simply ignored insults when a crowd once poked fun of him by calling him ""Mudammam"" - the ugly.
""Isn't it more in line with the prophet's example to ignore these caricatures and consider them as having no relation whatsoever with our prophet?,"" he said.

Wilders is one of Europe's most prominent far-rightists and has been a key figure in shaping the immigration debate in the Netherlands over the past decade, although he has never been in government.
On Saturday Wilders posted a cartoon picture of Erdogan and captioned it ""terrorist"". On Monday he posted an image of a sinking ship with a Turkish flag on it. ""Bye bye @RTErdogan. Kick Turkey out of NATO,"" he said under the image. 
Erdogan's lawyers filed a lawsuit with prosecutors in Ankara on Tuesday, saying Turkish courts had jurisdiction on the matter because the insults were directed at Turkey's president, Anadolu reported, citing the document filed by the lawyers.
""Even though the crime was committed directly against the person in the presidential seat, the value that is being violated is the state's political government structure,"" the lawyers said, according to Anadolu.
They said the comments by Wilders could not be viewed as freedom expression and that Wilders had targeted Erdogan's ""honour, dignity, character and reputation"".
Ankara has long been critical of the views and policies put forth by Wilders, leader of the Freedom Party. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Sunday called him a ""loser racist"" trying to gain support with animosity towards Islam and foreigners. 
""It is time for Europe to stop its spoiled, fascist-minded politicians,"" Cavusoglu said on Twitter.
Devlet Bahceli, leader of Turkey's Nationalist Movement Party and an ally of Erdogan, said on Tuesday that Wilders had ""dark ties"" with terrorist organisations.
""The degenerate leader of the Freedom Party has stooped so low as to call our president a terrorist. He has shown who truly is the terrorist, the fascist and the barbarian,"" Bahceli told members of his party in parliament.
The move comes a day after Erdogan urged Turks to boycott French goods over images of the Prophet Mohammad being displayed in France, which some Muslims consider blasphemous.
Wilders has frequently shocked the Dutch political establishment and offended Muslims. 

He was acquitted in a 2011 hate speech trial for remarks likening Islam to Nazism and calling for a ban on the Koran. Last month he was acquitted by an appeals court of discrimination, although the court upheld a conviction for intentionally insulting Moroccans as a group.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium's former King Albert has met his daughter Delphine for the first time, after she won a seven-year legal battle to prove that he is her father, earning recognition as a princess.
The two met Albert's wife, Queen Paola, last Sunday at their royal residence, the Belvedere castle, in the Brussels suburb of Laeken, the royal household said on Tuesday.
""This Sunday October 25, a new chapter has opened, filled with emotions, calm, understanding and also hope,"" the king, the queen and Delphine said in a statement.
""Our meeting took place at the Belvedere Castle, a meeting during which each of us was able to express, calmly and with empathy, our feelings and our experiences.""
""After the turmoil, the wounds and the suffering, comes the time for forgiveness, healing and reconciliation. This is the path, patient and at times difficult, that we have decided to take resolutely together.""
Delphine Boel, 52, a Belgian artist, fought a seven-year legal battle to prove that the former king is her father. After a DNA test confirmed that, a court granted her the title of princess earlier this month. Albert, 86, who abdicated six years ago in favour of his son Philippe, had long contested Boel's claim.
She has since changed her surname from Boel to Saxe-Cobourg, her father's family name.
Delphine had previously met Philippe for the first time on Oct. 15.
Until then, she said her father and siblings, including Philippe, had refused to communicate with her and she was not expecting anything from them.

""These first steps pave the way which is now up to us to follow peacefully,"" the statement said.

ABOVYAN, Armenia (Reuters) - In a factory where diamonds are cut, Anna Osipyan and her two grandchildren found something even more precious after fleeing their homes in the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh: shelter from the region's worst fighting in almost 30 years.
With nearly 200 others, many of them children, Osipyan has camped for a month inside the modern plant on the edge of the Armenian capital, Yerevan. On a tip from a friend, she arrived by car while her younger male relatives stayed behind to fight.
""This is our third war,"" said the 56-year-old resident of Stepanakert, the largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh. ""We have become used to it.""
Conflict reignited on Sept. 27 in Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. Hundreds have been killed and clashes have blown through three ceasefires. [nL1N2HH0EH]
Hours after the first shells hit, privately owned ADM Diamonds sent a bus to evacuate people from the conflict zone. At its factory 20 km (12 miles) from Yerevan, it replaced desks where precious stones are cut with dozens of makeshift beds.
""When there is a war, we can't talk about profit,"" company director Arsen Artashesyan told Reuters in the factory's backyard. ""We've turned this into a place where Karabakh refugees will live. Some people here don't have homes any more.""
Diamond-cutting is a major industry in Armenia. ADM generates about $35-40 million in annual sales and its factory in the town of Abovyan, opened three years ago and powered in part by solar panels on its roof, is the largest in the country.
Artashesyan said the company, which postponed an expansion into sapphires, rubies and topaz to make room for the refugees, would consider launching another, smaller factory inside Nagorno-Karabakh after the war. To this end, he said, it would soon begin training some of the refugees in cutting gemstones.
Armenians regard Nagorno-Karabakh as part of their historic homeland while Azeris consider the region to be illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control. About 30,000 people were killed in the 1991-94 war.
Osipyan's husband was among the dead, killed, she said, by an Azeri shell in 1994. Before leaving Stepanakert, she hid for two days in her basement as the city once more came under fire.
""It would protect us from shrapnel, more or less, but if the house had been hit directly, it would have been over,"" she said.
In the diamond factory, she sleeps in the same bed as her granddaughter, 17, and 11-year-old grandson. Her daughter, the children's mother, isn't with them - she was taken to hospital after contracting COVID-19 shortly after leaving home.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",COVID's cognitive costs? Some patients' brains may age 10 years,"By Kate Kelland
LONDON (Reuters) - People recovering from COVID-19 may suffer significant brain function impacts, with the worst cases of the infection linked to mental decline equivalent to the brain ageing by 10 years, researchers warned on Tuesday.
A non-peer-reviewed study of more than 84,000 people, led by Adam Hampshire, a doctor at Imperial College London, found that in some severe cases, coronavirus infection is linked to substantial cognitive deficits for months.
""Our analyses ... align with the view that there are chronic cognitive consequences of having COVID-19,"" the researchers wrote in a report of their findings. ""People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits.""
Cognitive tests measure how well the brain performs tasks –- such as remembering words or joining dots on a puzzle. Such tests are widely used to assess brain performance in diseases like Alzheimer's, and can also help doctors assess temporary brain impairments.
Hampshire's team analysed results from 84,285 people who completed a study called the Great British Intelligence Test. The findings, which have yet to be reviewed by other experts, were published online on the MedRxiv website.
The cognitive deficits were ""of substantial effect size"", particularly among people who had been hospitalised with COVID-19, the researchers said, with the worst cases showing impacts ""equivalent to the average 10-year decline in global performance between the ages of 20 to 70"".
Scientists not directly involved with the study, however, said its results should be viewed with some caution.
""The cognitive function of the participants was not known pre-COVID, and the results also do not reflect long-term recovery - so any effects on cognition may be short term,"" said Joanna Wardlaw, a professor of applied neuroimaging at Edinburgh University.
Derek Hill, a professor of medical imaging science at University College London, also noted that the study's findings could not be entirely reliable, since they did not compare before and after scores, and involved a large number of people who self-reported having had COVID-19, who had no positive test.
""Overall (this is) an intriguing but inconclusive piece of research into the effect of COVID on the brain,"" Hill said. 

""As researchers seek to better understand the long term impact of COVID, it will be important to further investigate the extent to which cognition is impacted in the weeks and months after the infection, and whether permanent damage to brain function results in some people.""

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:46AM ET</span>","Vaccines, not spy planes: U.S. misfires in Southeast Asia","By Tom Allard
JAKARTA (Reuters) - For months, by Zoom calls and then by jet, Indonesian ministers and officials scoured the world for access to a vaccine for the coronavirus that Southeast Asia's biggest country is struggling to control. This month, their campaign paid off.
Three Chinese companies committed 250 million doses of vaccines to the archipelago of 270 million people. A letter of intent was signed with a UK-based company for another 100 million.
Absent from these pledges: the United States.
Not only was it not promising any vaccine, but months earlier the United States shocked Indonesian officials by asking to land and refuel its spy planes in the territory, four senior Indonesian officials told Reuters. This would reverse a decades-long policy of strategic neutrality in the country.
With the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo due to visit Jakarta on Oct. 29, Washington's campaign to buttress its influence in the region - part of its escalating global rivalry with China - has been misfiring, say government officials and analysts.
On the other hand, China - Indonesia and the region's biggest investor and trading partner - has won ground with vaccines and trade.
America's strategic interests converge with those of many others in the region; Washington opposes Beijing's island-building and militarisation of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei dispute China's territorial claim to over 90% of the waterway.
Indonesia does not have a formal claim to the waters, but it, too, opposes China's claim. China is less popular among Indonesians than the United States, according to polling in 2018 by the Pew Research Center, a think-tank in Washington.
This is an edge that the United States under President Donald Trump has blunted, according to interviews with more than a dozen government officials, former diplomats and analysts. Meanwhile China is managing to parlay its economic heft and early recovery from coronavirus restrictions to strategic advantage, they said. 
""The U.S uses sanctions and muscle too much,"" said one Indonesian government source. ""China is smart. It always uses the soft power approach, the economic approach, the development approach.""
Pompeo said ahead of his visit that there are issues where the United States has already improved the relationship between the countries, ""but there's more that we can do."" 
U.S. assistant secretary of State David Stillwell said separately the U.S. was working to build a ""stronger economic partnership"" with Indonesia and the United States had donated 1,000 ventilators to the country, part of a $12.5 million coronavirus aid package. 
SPY PLANES
A former Dutch colony with hundreds of ethnic groups scattered over more than 17,000 islands, Indonesia is a founder member of the non-aligned movement, an alliance of developing countries which agreed after World War Two to avoid any defence tie-ups that serve the interests of the big powers. Since emerging from authoritarian rule 22 years ago, it has never allowed foreign militaries to stage operations on its soil, although it does conduct military exercises with other nations.
With this in mind, Indonesian officials said it was a surprise when the United States made multiple high-level approaches in late July and early August to Indonesia's defence and foreign ministers to grant landing and refueling rights to its P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft. These play a central role in monitoring China's military activity in Southeast Asia. 
The proposal - first reported by Reuters - was swiftly rejected after it was reviewed by Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, commonly known as ""Jokowi,"" the officials said.
Pompeo declined to comment on the rebuff. The U.S. Defence department declined to comment, as did spokespeople for Indonesia's government.
Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia have allowed P-8s to fly in and out of their territory; Washington's request was more political than operational, said Euan Graham (NYSE:GHM), an Asia-Pacific security analyst attached to the Shangri-la Dialogue, an annual meeting of regional security chiefs. 
The P-8 bid was part of a region-wide U.S. diplomatic blitz that began in mid-July with three days of speeches by Pompeo and other senior U.S. officials denouncing China's conduct in the South China Sea.
As well as declaring China's territorial claims unlawful, the United States accused Beijing of ""gangster tactics,"" saying Beijing denies Southeast Asian states the opportunity to develop the sea's resources. Washington has also announced sanctions on Chinese firms and individuals that help China build military installations on islands, atolls and shoals in the waters. China bases its claim in the South China Sea on what it calls ""historic rights.""
Repeated incursions into Indonesia's waters by Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels are an emotive issue in Indonesia, where there is a strong nationalist streak. The presence of about 36,000 Chinese workers in Indonesia - one-third of all foreign workers according to government data - has also riled many Indonesians.
In the past, the government has blown up Chinese and other foreign fishing vessels. 
Senior officials say Indonesia has told China bluntly of its concerns of its aggression in the South China Sea this year. In July, Indonesia held military exercises in the portion of the waterway its claims as its exclusive economic zone.
But Indonesian officials said Washington's response to China has been unnecessarily combative. Adding to their anxiety, they said, was a growing fear that military conflict was brewing after the U.S. and China held major military exercises in the South China Sea within sight of each other near the contested Paracel Islands on July 4. 
Foreign minister Retno responded to the rising superpower tensions in the region by contacting her counterparts in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) forum via their WhatsApp group. It was, said Retno, a ""very fluid and intensive communication"" that quickly led to a joint statement on Aug. 8 decrying the ""detrimental ramifications"" of ""changing geo-political dynamics in the region.""
VACCINE DIPLOMACY
President Jokowi, a former furniture manufacturer and exporter, has a plan to transform Indonesia's economy and set a course for the country to become one of the world's top five economies by 2045. That vision took a body-blow from the coronavirus pandemic.
With fewer than 400,000 infections and 14,000 deaths, Indonesia's official coronavirus burden is much lighter than many other big countries. However, epidemiologists and public health experts say very low rates of testing and contact-tracing mean the official figures significantly underestimate the spread and the government can't suppress the virus. An estimated 10 million Indonesians have fallen back into poverty and Indonesia's economic outlook has been downgraded repeatedly by the government and international agencies.
Jokowi has said the government's response to the pandemic and prospects for economic recovery are good compared to other countries. 
Early access to a vaccine is Indonesia's only shot at controlling the pandemic, said Greg Poling, a Southeast Asia analyst from the Washington D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""It's the silver bullet,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""They have to get the vaccine as fast as possible."" 
Jokowi's close confidant and Indonesia's coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment, Luhut Pandjaitan, gave the president cause for hope when he returned in October from China's Yunnan province with promised supplies of vaccines, which are in phase three trials, as well as a pledge to help Indonesia manufacture and export one of the vaccines to other countries.
""It is very easy dealing with the Chinese and they actually executed almost all of their promises and commitments,"" said a senior adviser who travelled to Yunnan with Pandjaitan.
The U.S., grappling with one of the world's most severe COVID-19 outbreaks, has hoarded its vaccines, withdrawn from the World Health Organization and, unlike China, refused to join a WHO-sponsored plan to pool vaccines and distribute them to countries based on need.
""They are completely ceding the field to China,"" said Aaron Connelly, an analyst with Singapore's International Institute for Strategic Studies.
On his trip to Yunnan, Pandjaitan also secured almost $20 billion in funding from Chinese companies for a pet project of the president: a plan to build a lithium battery factory and nickel processing industry, the adviser said. Next month, senior government officials say Indonesia is expected to sign the world's biggest trade pact – the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership - that involves ASEAN states and China, but not the U.S. Meanwhile, the U.S. has been reviewing Indonesia's preferential trade status, to the alarm of Jakarta.   
""NOT ONLY CHINA""
Indonesian officials and analysts say the Trump administration has made several unforced diplomatic errors in Southeast Asia. These started in 2018 when Trump did not attend the U.S.-ASEAN summit. In 2019, he sent his national security adviser, a relatively junior government member, prompting seven of the region's 10 leaders to boycott the event. Washington has not appointed an ambassador to ASEAN since 2017.
Connelly said Pompeo's confrontational rhetoric - he has described the Chinese Communist Party as the ""greatest threat"" to the U.S. - makes Southeast Asian states less willing to cooperate with the United States.
""He makes it about the U.S. versus China, rather than what China is doing to Southeast Asia,"" he said.
Dino Patti Djalal, an Indonesian ambassador to the United States from 2010 to 2013, said Pompeo's ""aggressively anti-China rhetoric"" was, in part, targeting a domestic political audience as the Trump administration tries to deflect criticism of its handling of the coronavirus onto China.
Trump's push to cast China as the villain because the virus originated there had not resonated with Southeast Asian governments, he said, while China's vaccine diplomacy and its early economic recovery will serve Beijing well strategically.
""China is smartly and strategically using the COVID crisis to advance their relationships (in the region),"" he said. ""They are striking that theme they have always been pushing: When there are difficulties, it is China, not the U.S., that you can rely on.""
Indonesia's foreign minister Retno Marsudi says Indonesia wants to engage with as many countries as possible when it comes to combating the coronavirus and developing its economy, including the U.S. This, she told Reuters, was the essence of Indonesia's ""independent and active"" foreign policy.

""It's not only China,"" she said.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Malaysia's king wins plaudits during political storm,"By A. Ananthalakshmi and Rozanna Latiff
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Frustrated with a months-long political power struggle during the coronavirus pandemic, Malaysians have praised King Al-Sultan Abdullah for rejecting Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's request on Sunday to impose emergency rule.
""He saved our People, Country and Democracy,"" Twitter user @Kushfein said in one of many positive responses to the king's decision posted on social media.
Holding a largely figurehead role, Malaysian monarchs rarely make headlines for their role in the country's political affairs, but Al-Sultan Abdullah has made several big calls since February, when an elected coalition government suddenly splintered.
And he could play a key role if the political instability continues, say constitutional lawyers and political analysts. 
The monarchy has traditionally been seen close to the government of the day, but Al-Sultan Abdullah's refusal of Muhyiddin's request has boosted confidence in the king's constitutional role.
""It restores a certain faith in the constitutional monarchy in this country that they are not just very passive,"" historian Kobkua Suwannathat-Pian said. 
'CHECK AND BALANCE'
Al-Sultan Abdullah gave Muhyiddin the premiership after the alliance headed by veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad fell apart in February. In the process he turned down Mahathir's late bid to show he had the numbers in parliament to retain power.
Earlier this month, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim went to the king to prove that he had assembled a majority to oust Muhyiddin. The king urged Anwar to follow the constitutional process, and in the two weeks since that meeting, he has repeatedly called for an end to politicking during the pandemic. 
On Sunday, the king refused Muhyiddin a state of emergency, which critics say would have allowed the prime minister to suspend parliament and effectively stymie any attempt to bring down his government.
But, the king also threw Muhyiddin a lifeline and told the country's party-hopping lawmakers to stop their power plays.
Posting on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shortly before the Malay rulers met to discuss the king's course of action, the crown prince of the powerful sultanate of Johor said the traditional rulers provided ""checks and balances"".
""The current situation is a clear indication of what would happen when power to rule is left entirely to politicians,"" the crown prince, Tunku Ismail Idris, said in his post.
POPULARITY
Malaysia has a unique system, as the nine Malay sultans take turns to assume the role of king every five years.
It is a largely ceremonial role, including acting as custodian of Islam in the Muslim-majority country.
In the early 1990s, the then prime minister Mahathir passed constitutional changes to curb some of the sultans' powers to stall legislation and ending their immunity from prosecution.
But the sultans are still held in deep respect by Malays and the non-Muslim Indian and Chinese minority communities.
Having become king after his father's abdication in 2019, Al-Sultan Abdullah, 61, has won popularity with his approachable demeanour and down-to-earth image, having been spotted helping accident victims on the highway and queuing up for food at KFC.
And the Malaysian monarchy's stock stands high at present compared to neighbouring Thailand, where there have been mass protests daily to call for the prime minister to resign and reforms of the monarchy and a scaling back of the king's powers.
""The monarchy no longer plays a ceremonial role but is taking an 'active part' to ease the uncertainty,"" said Muhammad Takiyuddin Ismail, a political science lecturer at the National University of Malaysia, adding that the rejection of the emergency request enhanced the monarchy's reputation.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",France warns citizens to be cautious as anger seethes in Muslim world over cartoons,"PARIS (Reuters) - France warned its citizens living or travelling in several Muslim-majority countries to take extra security precautions on Tuesday as anger surged over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad. 
In a sign that some countries want to limit the fallout, Saudi Arabia condemned the cartoons but held back from echoing calls by other Muslim states for a boycott of French products or other actions.
The row has its roots in a knife attack outside a French school on Oct. 16 in which a man of Chechen origin beheaded Samuel Paty, a teacher who had shown pupils cartoons of Prophet Mohammad in a civics lesson on freedom of speech. The caricatures are considered blasphemous by Muslims.
France's foreign ministry on Tuesday issued safety advice to French citizens in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq and Mauritania, advising them to exercise caution. They should stay away from any protests over the cartoons and avoid any public gatherings.
""It is recommended to exercise the greatest vigilance, especially while travelling, and in places that are frequented by tourists or expatriate communities,"" it said.
The French embassy in Turkey issued similar advice to its citizens there. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the most vociferous critics of the French government, leading calls for a boycott of French goods.
French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin retorted on Tuesday that Turkey, and Pakistan, should not meddle in France's domestic affairs.
Paris has recalled its ambassador in Ankara, and Pakistan's parliament on Monday passed a resolution urging the government to recall its envoy from Paris.
The images of the Prophet were first published years ago by a French satirical magazine, whose editorial offices were attacked in 2015 by gunmen who killed 12 people.
Since the beheading of the teacher Paty this month, the cartoons have been displayed in France in solidarity, angering some Muslims.
President Emmanuel Macron, who met representatives of France's Muslim community on Monday, has pledged to fight ""Islamist separatism"", saying it was threatening to take over some Muslim communities in France.
SAUDI CONDMENS TERRORISM
Saudi Arabia appeared to be taking a moderate response to the controversy, steering clear of boycott calls. A Saudi foreign ministry official said on Tuesday the Gulf state condemns all acts of terrorism, an apparent reference to Paty's killing. 
""Freedom of expression and culture should be a beacon of respect, tolerance and peace that rejects practices and acts which generate hatred, violence and extremism and are contrary to coexistence,"" the official said in a statement.
The daily Arab News on Tuesday cited the head of the Saudi-based Muslim World League, Mohammed al-Issa, as cautioning that an over-reaction ""that is negative and goes beyond what is acceptable"" would only benefit ""haters"".
However, calls for a boycott of French supermarket chain  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) were trending on social media in Saudi Arabia. In Kuwait, some supermarkets have pulled French products. 
Turkey's Erdogan on Monday asked his compatriots to stop buying French goods and accused France of pursuing an anti-Islam agenda.
France is a major exporter of grain to mainly-Muslim NorthAfrica, and French companies in the autos and retail sectors also have significant exposure to majority-Muslim countries.
French Trade Minister Franck Riester said it was too earlyto put a figure on the impact of a boycott campaign but so farit was limited and mainly affected French agricultural exports.
Iran's Foreign Ministry summoned the French charge d'affaires over the cartoons, state media reported on Tuesday.
A ministry official told the diplomat during their meeting on Monday that Iran strongly rejected ""any insult and disrespect to the Prophet of Islam"".

In Bangladesh on Monday, protesters held placards with the image of the French President and the words: ""Macron is the enemy of peace"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The United States and India signed a pact to share sensitive satellite and map data on Tuesday as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned of the threat posed by an increasingly assertive China.
Pompeo, who arrived in New Delhi on Monday along with Defense Secretary Mark Esper, said after talks with their Indian counterparts that the two countries had to work together to confront the threat China posed to security and freedom.
The annual U.S.-India strategic dialogue comes at a time of heightened tension in the region, with Indian troops confronting Chinese forces on their disputed Himalayan border.
""Big things are happening as our democracies align to better protect the citizens of our two countries and indeed, of the free world,"" Pompeo told reporters after the talks with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
""Our leaders, and our citizens, see with increasing clarity that the Chinese Communist Party is no friend to democracy, the rule of law, transparency, nor to freedom of navigation, the foundation of a free and open, prosperous Indo-Pacific,"" Pompeo said.
The new defence pact - the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation - was a ""significant milestone"" that would foster cooperation between the militaries of both countries, Esper told the news conference. 
The United States planned to sell more fighter planes and drones to India, Esper added. The pact will give India access to a range of topographical, nautical and aeronautical data that is considered vital for targeting of missiles and armed drones.
It would also allow the United States to provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on U.S.-supplied aircraft to India, an Indian defence source said.
'HARPING ON'
U.S. President Donald Trump has made being tough on China a key part of his campaign to secure a second term in next week's presidential election and Pompeo has been trying to bolster allies to counter China's growing influence in the region.
China dismissed Pompeo's accusations.
""We urge Pompeo to abandon his Cold War mentality, zero-sum mindset, and stop harping on the 'China threat',"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a news briefing in Beijing earlier on Tuesday.
India has its own problems with China.
In June, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops on their high-altitude border, hardening the mood in India against China and driving Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to seek closer military ties with the United States.
Jaishankar did not refer directly to China in his comments at the news conference but hailed ""national security convergences"" with the United States and their determination to tackle security and counter-terrorism issues and ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
This month, India invited Australia to join naval drills it holds each year with the United States and Japan, brushing off Chinese concerns that the exercises destabilise the region. 
Pompeo and Esper met Modi earlier on Tuesday for talks that included regional stability, a U.S. government spokesman said.

A quarter of a century after the U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace accords ended the war among Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks in which about 100,000 people were killed, many war criminals are still at large in the ethnically divided country.
Unčanin Boško, 51, and Despot Dragan, 56, are accused of violating the provisions of the Geneva conventions on the protection of civilians during wartime and of crimes against humanity, the prosecutor's office said.
They were detained in the northwestern city of Banja Luka. 
The two former Bosnian Serb army soldiers are suspected of driving the Bosniak civilians out of a school in the western village of Velagici in which they were detained, lining them up and, firing from automatic rifles with other soldiers, killing at least 78, the statement said.
The victims' bodies were transported by trucks and buried in a mass grave from which they were exhumed in 1996. 
The 1992-1995 Bosnian war was marked by the persecution and killing of Croats and Bosniaks from territories the Bosnian Serbs had mapped out for their exclusively Serb state. 
The Croat and Bosniak-dominated armies also committed crimes in the war in which all three parties fought each other at different times.

Hassan Zaid, minister of sports and youth in the Houthi administration, died in hospital from his wounds after gunmen opened fire on his car in an area of the capital that houses embassies, two sources close to his family told Reuters. 
Houthi-run Al Masirah television confirmed the killing, citing the group's interior ministry as saying Zaid was assassinated by ""criminal elements"" linked to a Saudi-led military coalition engaged in Yemen. It said Zaid's daughter was also in the car and was seriously injured.
The coalition did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The coalition has been fighting against the Iran-aligned Houthis for more than five years, since the movement ousted Yemen's internationally recognised government from Sanaa.
Last year, a senior Houthi official and brother of the movement's leader was killed in Sanaa. The group blamed ""treacherous hands"" associated with the coalition, while the alliance said his death was caused by infighting.
In 2018, coalition airstrikes on Hodeidah on Yemen's west coast killed the president of the Houthi-backed political body which runs most of northern Yemen.
The United Nations is trying to revive peace talks to end the war which has killed more than 100,000 people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.

From January to September, there were 5,939 civilian casualties in the fighting - 2,117 people killed and 3,822 wounded, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a report.
""High levels of violence continue with a devastating impact on civilians, with Afghanistan remaining among the deadliest places in the world to be a civilian,"" the mission said in a quarterly report.
Civilian casualties were 30% lower than in the same period last year but UNAMA said violence has failed to slow since the beginning of talks between government negotiators and the Taliban that began in the Qatari capital of Doha last month.
The Taliban were responsible for 45% of civilian casualties while government troops caused 23%, it said. U.S.-led international forces were responsible for 2%.
Most of the remainder came in crossfire, or were caused by Islamic State militants or ""undetermined"" anti-government or pro-government elements, it said.
Ground fighting caused the most casualties followed by suicide and roadside bomb attacks, targeted killings by the Taliban and air strikes by Afghan troops, the U.N. mission said.
Fighting has sharply increased in several parts of the country in recent weeks while government negotiators and the Taliban have failed to make progress in the peace talks.
Casualties among combatants on both sides have also been high, officials have said.

The talks in Doha are aimed at ending 19 years of conflict since U.S.-backed forces, supported by U.S. air strikes, ousted the Taliban in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Keith Raniere, the founder of a cult-like group where women were kept on starvation diets, branded with his initials, and ordered to have sex with him, faces possible life in prison when he is sentenced on Tuesday in Brooklyn for crimes of which he maintains his innocence.
Federal prosecutors say they want Raniere, 60, to remain behind bars for life as punishment for the ""immeasurable damages"" to victims he exploited as head of NXIVM, a purported self-help group headquartered near Albany, New York.
Raniere has remained defiant. In a court filing last month, his lawyers said Raniere maintained his ""complete innocence,"" and viewed his conviction as the result of a ""media campaign involving witnesses who were motivated to testify falsely"" at ""an unfair trial.""
Lawyers for Raniere have asked U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who will impose the sentence, for no more than 15 years in prison.
Raniere was convicted in June 2019 of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, possession of child pornography and other crimes, after jurors heard extensive testimony from former NXIVM members.
Prosecutors said Raniere created a secret sorority within NXIVM called DOS, where female ""slaves"" turned over nude photos and other compromising materials that could be used for blackmail if they tried to leave.
Raniere was also accused by prosecutors of having a sexual relationship with a girl starting when she was 15, and who later became part of his inner circle of DOS slaves. Prosecutors said he kept nude photos of the girl, which are the basis of the child pornography charge.
The girl's older sister, who was also deeply involved in NXIVM, testified at length against Raniere at the trial.
Nonetheless, the girls' father was among more than 50 people who wrote letters to Garaufis urging leniency for Raniere. Many said their lives had been greatly improved by NXIVM classes, which could cost thousands of dollars.
Raniere's lawyers have maintained that no one in DOS or NXIVM was ever coerced.
Several other people affiliated with NXIVM have pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, actress Allison Mack, former NXIVM president Nancy Salzman and her daughter Lauren Salzman, who testified as the prosecution's star witness. 
Bronfman, who was accused of helping bankroll NXIVM, was sentenced last month to more than six years in prison.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A bomb blast at a religious seminary in the Pakistani city of Peshawar on Tuesday killed at least seven people and wounded more than 80, police and hospital officials said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bomb in the northwestern city, near the border with Afghanistan, which has long been plagued by Islamist violence.
""Unknown people planted explosives in a plastic bag,"" said a police officer who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to media.
Peshawar police chief Mohammad Ali Gandapur told Reuters the bomb contained up to 6 kg (13 lb) of explosives. 
Though militant violence in the city, and in Pakistan in general, has fallen over recent years, there has been an increase in attacks on the security forces this year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is capital. 
Some of the past attacks have been claimed by the Pakistani Taliban. However, the militant group released a statement saying they condemned Tuesday's blast and denied involvement. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan on Twitter sent his condolences to family members of the victims and the injured. ""I want to assure my nation we will ensure the terrorists responsible for this cowardly barbaric attack are brought to justice ASAP,"" he said. 
Tariq Burki, director the city's Lady Reading Hospital, said earlier that four of the seven dead were children but later said four children were wounded and all the dead were adults. 
Five of the 83 wounded were in critical condition, he said.
The hospital released a list showing more than a dozen of those wounded were from Afghanistan.
A video shared by police showed the madrassa's religious scholar Sheikh Rahimullah addressing students, citing religious texts on the importance of education when a huge blast ripped through the hall, knocking over the camera. 
A hospital source said he had survived the blast but was receiving treatment in hospital. 
Photos provided by police depicting the aftermath showed debris strewn around the hall and a small crater. 
The madrassa is largely for adult students and many were studying when the blast happened, said city resident Abdul Rahim, whose said his 27-year old cousin was among the wounded.

""He told us they were attending a class when the blast took place,"" Rahim said.

(Reuters) - Street protests broke out on Monday night in the western part of the U.S. city of Philadelphia, injuring four police, after police had shot and killed a Black man they said had been armed with a knife.
The violence is the latest in months of anti-racism protests across the United States since the May death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American, after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Four officers were hit with bricks when Monday's protest outside a police station in Philadelphia turned violent and they had to be taken to hospital, broadcaster NBC said.
Earlier, a man identified by officials as Walter Wallace, 27, had approached two police officers who drew their guns after warning him to put down the knife, video of the afternoon's shooting on social media showed.
The incident raised questions and was being investigated, Mayor Jim Kenny and Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said in separate statements.
""The Officer Involved Shooting Investigation Unit of the Philadelphia police department will conduct a full investigation,"" Kenney said.
Outlaw said she heard ""the anger of the community"" after Wallace's death.
Reuters could not immediately verify the video on social media, recorded by a bystander, which showed the two officers point their guns at Wallace as he walked in the street.
He approached them as they backed away, with guns still aimed at him, while yelling to him to put down his knife.
Both then fired several shots and Wallace collapsed in the street, according to the video.
Tension rose as the death of Wallace sparked clashes between protesters and local police.
Since the incident in Minneapolis, demonstrators have turned out nationwide to demand racial equality and an end to police brutality, with protests sometimes turning violent.
Activist groups reiterated a demand to defund the police, with the American Civil Liberties Union saying state violence could not be the answer to society's problems.
""It is time to divest in police and invest in community programs, including the kind of mental health services that allow intervention that may have prevented Mr. Wallace's killing,"" said Reggie Shuford, executive director of the Pennsylvania ACLU.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 05:16AM ET</span>",'Perfect storm': How Nigeria's peaceful police protests turned violent,"By Alexis Akwagyiram
LAGOS (Reuters) - Tears fill Ephraim Osinboyejo's eyes as he recalls the idealism that drove thousands of Nigerians like him into the streets to campaign against police brutality - and the night he saw young activists gunned down. 
The 39-year-old businessman says he returned to Nigeria last year after two decades abroad because he wanted to help his country. When nationwide demonstrations began on Oct. 8, he volunteered to manage logistics at the main protest site in Lagos. 
But what began as a largely peaceful movement, driven by young, tech-savvy activists who used social media to grab global attention, turned into some of the worst street violence the country has seen since the end of military rule in 1999.
Police and soldiers enforcing a curfew killed at least 12 people in two Lagos neighbourhoods on Oct. 20, according to witnesses and rights group Amnesty International. The army and police denied involvement.
In the following days, crowds set fire to police stations and government offices. Looting was reported at shopping malls and government food warehouses. Curfews were imposed on millions. 
Protest organizers, some in hiding, are now urging followers to stay off the streets and campaign online as police have made their presence increasingly felt.
""I feel defeated. I feel disappointed. I feel sad,"" Osinboyejo said at the Lekki district toll gate where hundreds had gathered to protest abuses by a notorious police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).
Days later, cars were passing through the toll gate as the protests subsided. The image of a clenched fist daubed onto the road and a few Nigerian flags lying in a gutter were the only reminders of the joyful crowds who danced and sang there a week ago.
'PERFECT STORM'
Protesters and government officials have both said that the people doing the looting and vandalism are not for the most part the same people who mobilised against police brutality. 
""We completely condemn any form of violence or looting,"" a coalition of protest groups said in a statement on Saturday. 
Demonstrators accused officials of paying armed gangs to disrupt peaceful protests - a common tactic during elections, according to rights groups. 
""If people cannot afford basic needs, you have people who are willing to do anything to get by,"" Osinboyejo said.
Reuters could not verify the accusation. Videos of unidentified men attacking demonstrators in Lagos and the capital Abuja with knives and sticks were shared on social media early in the protests. 
Spokesmen for the Nigeria Police Force and Interior Ministry did not respond to calls and text messages seeking comment.
Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu blamed criminal elements for the unrest, saying ""miscreants were hiding under the umbrella of the protests to unleash mayhem"". 
Police used live ammunition to disperse crowds in Lagos, Abuja and Jos, Amnesty International said. 
While such shootings may have been the catalyst for escalating unrest, analysts also point to the parlous state of Africa's biggest economy.
Some 35% of people aged 15-34 are unemployed. Families already struggling to put food on the table because of double-digit inflation also face rising fuel and electricity costs which the government can no longer afford to subsidize. 
""The ingredients for a perfect storm have been there for a while,"" said Malte Liewerscheidt, a vice president with New York-based risk consultancy Teneo. 
The violence brought widespread criticism of President Muhammadu Buhari, with many questioning his control over security forces and angered by his failure to condemn the killings in his first speech after the incident. He is in his final term as president but his All Progressives Congress party could lose support from young voters.
LEKKI SHOOTING
SARS was disbanded on Oct. 11, but protests persisted with demonstrators calling for wider law enforcement reforms.
Around 2 p.m. on Oct. 20, news of a round-the-clock curfew started spreading through the crowd in Lekki, but many decided to stay, Osinboyejo said. 
Around 7 p.m., armed men in army fatigues arrived, he said.
He and other organizers urged demonstrators to kneel down, wave flags and sing the national anthem, but the men raised their guns and shot into the crowd, six witnesses told Reuters.
""This place was a war zone,"" Osinboyejo said. ""The gunfire was relentless ... I didn't think we would see tomorrow."" 
The army says its forces were not at Lekki that night.
Days later, Nicholas Okpe, 37, lay in a Lagos hospital wheezing and coughing from a bullet wound to the chest. 
An unemployed driver, he said he was collecting litter dropped at the Lekki protest site when the shooting happened. For him the campaign is about more than police reforms - it is about justice. 
""Anger is inside our belly. Because many of us don't get work, we just get frustrated,"" he said. 
The Feminist Coalition - a rights group that raised 147 million naira ($385,000) for the protests through crowdfunding, said on Thursday it was no longer accepting donations.
It would use any remaining funds to cover medical and legal bills, and provide financial support to victims of police brutality. 
""We are young Nigerians with hopes, dreams and aspirations for our country. This means we need to stay alive to pursue our dreams to build the future,"" the statement said.
Despite his sadness, Osinboyejo remains optimistic for Nigeria.

""There are a lot of young people who have come together, for the first time maybe, to say they will not stand by and watch their country burn,"" he said, choking back tears.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Analysis: Wolves and weed - U.S. voters choose future of public lands,"By Carey L. Biron
WASHINGTON ( Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation) - When Ricardo Cortes' oldest son started kindergarten at their neighbourhood school in Oakland, California, he was disheartened by the barren, baking schoolyard. 
""It literally reminded me of a prison. It's got these huge, high chain-link fences, bare asphalt, no shade,"" the 48-year-old police officer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Although his two sons, now ages 7 and 9, are attending school remotely due to the pandemic, things could start to change by the time they go back.  
Next week, alongside choosing the president and other elected officials, Oakland voters could make available $200 million for school improvements based on COVID-19 requirements. 
The improvements include what backers call green or living schoolyards, areas that could also be opened to the broader public. 
""Green schoolyards can benefit not only the children at that school, they can provide an accessible network of oases around the whole city,"" said Amanda Brown-Stevens, executive director of the Greenbelt Alliance, a nonprofit that supports the proposal. 
On Election Day, voters in nearly 50 jurisdictions around the country could create $3.6 billion in funding for parks, open spaces and other public lands, according to a tally by the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit. 
In part these are a response to the coronavirus pandemic, during which outdoor activities have been considered safer, said Bill Lee, the trust's senior vice president.
But record-high use of parks has underscored longstanding concerns around equitable access, he said. 
Across the United States, 100 million people lack access to parks within a 10-minute walk of their homes, Lee said. 
In addition, parks serving primarily non-white populations are half the size of those serving majority-white areas and serve five times as many people per acre, he said. 
""People knew this intuitively from walking around their cities, but the pandemic has brought it home,"" he said. 
The group is leading a national coalition urging legislators to include $500 million in a stimulus bill to ""jumpstart park creation in park-poor neighborhoods,"" Lee said. 
'FOLLOWING UP ON THE RHETORIC'
Equity considerations have become a major focus for parks development in Portland, Oregon, where voters will be asked to approve a tax levy worth about $48 million a year for parks, said Randy Gragg, executive director of the Portland Parks Foundation. 
A key part of the strategy is to create equitable access, Gragg said. 
Many communities of color live in east Portland, where 40% of households lack access to a park within a half mile, he said.
""This has been a long-term conversation, but its edge has been particularly sharpened by the pandemic and Black Lives Matter movement,"" he said, adding that the levy would ""really change the face of access for families facing economic problems"". 
In San Francisco, the pandemic's economic impact is spurring an effort to address open space and create jobs. 
Nearly half of a proposed $487.5 million bond is targeted at neighborhood parks and green space, said Drew Becher, chief executive with SF Parks Alliance. 
In the pandemic, parks have come to be seen ""not just as niceties but as necessities"", he said, pointing out that overflow hospitals have been set up in city parks. 
If voters approve the proposal, backers will seek to focus on neighbourhoods of color, he said.
""It's about equity and following up on the rhetoric with actual dollars into these communities."" 
 
NEW PLANS
Public lands initiatives on the ballot will not focus only on urban spaces, with voters in at least two states being asked to try novel state-wide strategies.
In Colorado, voters will decide whether to require state officials to devise a plan to reintroduce grey wolves to the wild - the first time in the country that the public has been allowed such an opportunity.
If successful, there is significant scope for such action outside of Colorado, experts say, though the issue remains highly contentious. 
""The extent of public lands in the West gives us unique opportunities for biodiversity conservation and restoration,"" said Courtney Schultz, director of the Public Lands Policy Group at Colorado State University. 
""At the same time we have to stay cognizant of the history of the many users and communities around public lands that make this a complex issue.""  
Opponents say the wolf that used to live in Colorado is now extinct and that the animal that would be introduced is much larger and more aggressive, and would be harmful to certain native wildlife.
In Montana, voters will decide whether to legalize adult cannabis use - and to funnel nearly half of resulting tax revenue into conservation and supporting public lands. 
That makes sense for a state with an outdoor recreation industry worth some $7 billion a year, said Aaron Murphy, executive director of Montana Conservation Voters, which has endorsed the measures. 
""Public lands has been a major issue for this entire election season,"" he said. 
The initiative would eventually bring in about $18 million a year for public lands, said Murphy. 
""In the West, public lands and private lands are a strange patchwork,"" he said. ""This can help purchase parcels that makes them a bit more accessible.""
 
'FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT VISIONS'
National politics are the inevitable focus of this year's election, as voters prepare to decide between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, but public lands remain a key issue. 
""It is undoubtedly the case that public lands are becoming a bigger and bigger political issue in this country,"" said Alex Taurel, conservation program director with the League of Conservation Voters, which has endorsed Biden. 
""These are two fundamentally different visions for public lands."" 
Trump's administration has focused on deregulation and energy production on public lands, including in offshore waters, Taurel said. 
The president has attempted to remove protections from nearly 35 million acres of public lands, 1,000 times more than his administration has protected, according to May research by the Center for American Progress think tank. 
In contrast, Biden supports a plan to conserve nearly a third of U.S. lands and waters by the end of the decade.
The governance of public lands is always fraught, but the Trump administration has ignored delicate multi-stakeholder initiatives, roiling processes that took decades to build up, said James Skillen, associate professor of environmental studies at Calvin University in Michigan.
Neither the Interior Department nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment.  
""What the Trump administration is doing is disrupting a wide range of agreements,"" said Skillen, author of ""This Land is My Land: Rebellion in the West"". 
""The long-term danger is the more that happens, the less willing people are to invest in a consensus-type approach to public lands.""

In a video message on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, Peter Szijjarto said Budapest had not received formal notice of the Ukrainian ban.
In the video, Szijjarto welcomed the victory of Hungarian candidates in Ukrainian local elections, which he said meant Hungarians' opinion would have to be considered for the future of the region bordering Hungary, which has a large ethnic Hungarian minority. 
He said Ukraine had taken ""unfriendly steps"" towards Hungary, by summoning the Hungarian ambassador and deciding to ban the entry of the two officials.
""With this Ukraine sends the message ... that it has given up on Hungarian support for its euroatlantic integration efforts,"" Szijjarto said.
It was not the first time that Hungary has hinted at blocking Ukraine’s membership of NATO.
The two countries have repeatedly clashed in the past years over what Hungary said were curbs on the rights of roughly 150,000 ethnic Hungarians to use their native tongue, especially in education, after Ukraine passed a law in 2017 restricting the use of minority languages in schools.
Ukraine's foreign ministry said on Monday it had handed the Hungarian ambassador a note of protest for what it described as political agitation by Hungarian officials in favour of a party that contested Saturday's elections in Ukraine.

In 2016, Duterte won the presidency campaigning on a promise to fight corruption, crime and illegal drugs. 
But his administration has been dogged by scandals and allegations of graft and cover-ups in state agencies ranging from prisons, the state insurer, immigration, airports and customs, to police and the drugs enforcement agency, few of which led to convictions or high-profile resignations.
Duterte on Tuesday issued a memorandum directing the justice ministry to look into anomalies at state agencies until the end of his term in 2022. It gives the ministry the power to decide what allegations to investigate and to work with other agencies.
""This country continues to be plagued with corruption,"" Duterte said in a televised national address. ""Up to now, it is not weakening, it is getting stronger,"" he said, vowing to focus his remaining term on fighting corruption.
The Philippines fell 14 notches to 113th spot among 180 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index last year.
Duterte is not eligible for re-election, but fulfilling his campaign pledge on corruption could help the chances of his chosen successor in the 2022 elections. 
The justice secretary vowed on Tuesday his ministry would work with other government agencies on investigations.
""It will help us a lot if government workers themselves and the people they deal with would come forward and provide us the necessary information to uncover corrupt activities and identify the perpetrators,"" Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told reporters.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 02:19AM ET</span>",Cabbies and office workers: Meet Singapore's ordinary royals,"By Chen Lin, Edgar Su and John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - In the modern republic of Singapore, several seemingly ordinary people working in offices or driving taxis can claim to be of royal blood, descendants of a 19th century monarch who ceded control of the Southeast Asian island to the British.
But few residents in one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities are even aware of this lineage, a sore point with Tengku, or Prince, Shawal, acclaimed by some members of his family as 'head of the house of Singapore'.
""They still exist?"" is a response the 51-year-old says he often receives when he tells people he is one of the descendants of Sultan Hussein Shah - whose treaties with the British led to colonial rule and the founding of the modern country.
Shawal is one of several Singaporeans who bear the honorific name Tengku, meaning prince or princess in Malay, and claim links to the Sultan.
Until the turn of this century, some of them still lived in their ancestral home, a crowded, dilapidated palace, before they were evicted by the government which turned it into a museum.
Seventy nine descendants, of whom 14 were living in the palace, were offered payouts as part of colonial-era deal to provide for the Sultan's family, the government said at the time. Many of the others were living overseas, it said.
The legal beneficiaries' names were not made public, making it difficult to verify royal claims. 
The Singapore government, which has ruled unbroken since the city-state's independence in 1965, told Reuters that all but one of the payments have been made but it was unable to share more details on the beneficiaries. 
""NOT A DYNASTY""
Shawal, who showed Reuters government correspondence identifying him as a beneficiary, still regularly visits the palace-cum-museum and its nearby mosque and cemetery in the city-state's Malay heritage enclave called Kampong Glam. 
Despite facing personal issues with his income cut and his logistics job at risk due to the coronavirus pandemic, Shawal says he devotes time to keeping the Sultan's heritage alive by dressing in traditional royal costume and attending celebratory events.
But gaining wider recognition is a challenge, even among a disparate and somewhat divided band of claimants.
Other descendants warn about the dangers of living in the past or are too preoccupied with hardships of the present.
""We are not a dynasty. It is not important whether you are a descendant of the royal family or not,"" said Tengku Indra, a 67-year-old consultant who lived in the palace grounds as a child.
""What is crucial is you must earn your life through meritocracy instead of enjoying an ascribed status based on ancestral position.""
Indra was described as the great-great-great-great grandson of Sultan Hussein in an article by government-affiliated heritage society Friends of the Museums Singapore last year.
Indra's son, 40-year-old businessman Tengku Azan has a two-year-old daughter who would be one of the youngest descendants.
He thinks future generations will not take much interest in the Sultan's history. ""The past inadvertently takes a back seat and remains uncherished,"" he said.
For other former palace residents, life in the outside world has been a rude awakening. 
Tengku Faizal, 43, said after he left the palace in 1999 he took a job as a cleaner in a condominium and would get teased for being the prince who handles garbage.
He now drives a taxi but says he is struggling to make ends meet and has been given financial assistance to cover his daughter's childcare fees. To help out, his wife has taken a part-time job in a McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) outlet.
""We are not smart, we are not rich,"" Faizal said, speaking in English. ""We got title only."" 
In neighbouring Malaysia, a constitutional monarchy where Sultans still play an active role in public life, honorific names are far more common. 
Of seven Singapore claimants Reuters interviewed, Shawal was the most eager about celebrating his heritage.
But even he had his own doubts about passing on the ""burden"" of the royal title and did not give it to his daughter at birth.
Now 27 and working for a biotech firm, Princess Puteri has reclaimed her Tengku name but says she also finds explaining her credentials an uphill task in a country that has largely forgotten this piece of history.

""Some part of me feels sad because I need to explain who I am. But the moment when they look at Prince Harry they know he is the prince,"" she said, referring to the globally popular grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.

The comments by the Chinese embassy in Colombo came shortly before the arrival on Tuesday of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is on a an Asian tour aimed at pushing back against China's growing influence in the region.
""We are firmly opposed to the United States taking the opportunity of the State Secretary's visit to sow and interfere in China-Sri Lanka relations, and to coerce and bully Sri Lanka,"" the embassy said in a statement late on Monday.
China has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka as part of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at linking Asia, Europe and beyond, to the alarm of India and the United States.
The embassy said China's ties with Sri Lanka stretched back 2,000 years and the two countries did not need a third party to dictate terms.
Pompeo's trip to Sri Lanka, and later to the Maldives, another Indian Ocean island nation, is seen as part of an attempt to counter China's dominating economic presence in smaller countries that has left some of them in deep debt.
Ahead of the trip, Dean Thompson, the senior State Department official for South and Central Asian affairs, said Sri Lanka must make tough choices to secure its economic independence over the longer term.
China also raised concern about Pompeo making the trip at a time when Sri Lanka is struggling with the novel coronavirus.
""Is it helpful to local epidemic prevention and control? Is it in the interests of the Sri Lankan people,"" the embassy asked. 
A Chinese delegation led by its top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, visited Colombo this month but it kept its personnel and activities to a minimum in line with guidelines to prevent a surge in cases, the embassy said.
""We are willing to share these practices with the United States, hoping to provide some reference for Mr State Secretary's visit and its handling of relations with small and medium-sized countries,"" it said.

China's strict internet censorship rules have been tightened numerous times in recent years and in the latest crackdown, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has told firms operating mobile browsers that they have until Nov. 9 to conduct a ""self examination"" and rectify problems.
The problems include the spreading of rumours, the use of sensationalist headlines and the publishing of content that violates the core values of socialism, it said in a statement.
""For some time, mobile browsers have grown in an uncivilised way ... and have become a gathering place and amplifier for dissemination of chaos by 'self-media',"" the CAC said, referring to independently operated social media accounts, many of which publish news.
""After the rectification, mobile browsers that still have outstanding problems will be dealt with strictly according to laws and regulations until related businesses are banned.""
The campaign will initially focus on eight of the most influential mobile browsers in China, including those operated by Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL],  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding's UCWeb and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp, it said.
Others include the QQ platform owned by Tencent, Qihoo-owned 360, Oppo and Sogou (NYSE:SOGO). 
Huawei's browser unit said in a statement on Tuesday it would conduct a comprehensive self-examination and clean-up in line with the regulator's requests, and would also place strict controls over 'self media' accounts. 
Xiaomi and UCWeb declined to comment, while Tencent, Oppo, Sogou and 360 did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Legislation introduced in recent years by China include measures to restrict media outlets, surveillance measures for media sites and rolling campaigns to remove content deemed unacceptable.

Lam, speaking at a weekly news briefing on Tuesday, said she would leave on Nov. 3 for the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, where she will take a coronavirus test before travelling to Beijing. 
""My trip to Beijing this time is solely on the economic side that is in light of the economic situation, which of course is very serious in Hong Kong,"" Lam said on Tuesday.
""We need more support measures from the mainland of China, especially in light of the overall direction that Hong Kong should move to better integrate with the mainland of China especially in the Greater Bay Area.""
The Beijing-backed leader postponed her annual policy address earlier this month in order to travel to the mainland for talks on how the central government can support the former British colony's economic recovery.
She said she still plans to deliver her policy address by the end of November.
Lam has repeatedly touted the importance of the Greater Bay area - a region that includes Hong Kong, Macau and nine cities in China's Guangdong province - as a key pillar to provide economic benefits to the Chinese-ruled city.
Hong Kong is reeling from the double blow of anti-government protests that plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades last year and the impact of coronavirus.
Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in June that punishes what authorities broadly define as secession, sedition and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail, following a year of sometimes violent demonstrations. 
Western governments and international human rights groups have expressed concern the law will crush freedoms in Hong Kong. 

Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have said the law is necessary to bring stability to the city.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of 100 Boeing-made Harpoon Coastal Defense Systems to Taiwan in a deal that has a potential value of up to $2.37 billion, the Pentagon said on Monday.
The move comes days after the State Department approved the potential sale of three other weapons systems to Taiwan, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion, prompting a sanctions threat from China.
China will impose sanctions on  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT), Boeing Defense, Raytheon (N:RTX) and other U.S. companies it says are involved in Washington's arms sales to Taiwan, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Monday.
""We deplore Beijing’s efforts to retaliate against U.S. and foreign companies for their sales that support Taiwan’s legitimate self-defense requirements,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.
Monday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department covered the proposed sale of up to 100 Harpoon Coastal Defense Systems (HCDS), which includes 400 RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II Surface Launched Missiles to serve as coastal defense cruise missiles.
Taiwan said the arms sales showed the island's defense was of ""great importance"" to the U.S. government. 
""Facing China's military expansion and provocation, Taiwan will continue to enhance the modernization of defense capacity and speed up asymmetric warfare capabilities,"" it said in a statement.
The State Department sent notifications to Capitol Hill last week for the first tranche of arms sales including truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed, Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) missiles and related equipment made by  Boeing Co  (N:BA), and external sensor pods for F-16 jets.
Reuters was first to report in September that sales of major weapons systems to Taiwan were making their way through the U.S. export process. 
The formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales, but this is unlikely given broad bipartisan support for the defense of Taiwan. 
The U.S. moves come as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on China in the run-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election and concerns rise about Beijing's intentions toward Taiwan. Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that it has vowed to ""reunite"" with the mainland, by force if necessary.

The prince spoke during a conversation about racism with Patrick Hutchinson, the Black activist who was photographed by Reuters carrying a white man to safety during a scuffle between anti-racism protesters and far-right opponents in London in June.
Harry told Hutchinson he saw him as a ""guardian angel"" protecting everyone at the demonstration. Both men said there was still work to be done to defeat discrimination of all kinds.
""Unconscious bias, from my understanding, having the upbringing and the education that I had, I had no idea what it was. I had no idea it existed,"" Harry said during the online conversation, recorded last week for a feature by the magazine GQ.
""And then, sad as it is to say, it took me many, many years to realise it, especially then living a day or a week in my wife's shoes,"" added the prince. Meghan's father is white and her mother is African American.
Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have spoken out several times on race issues since stepping down from their roles as working members of the royal family at the end of March and moving to California.
Hutchinson, 50, told Harry a friend who had been at a previous protest where a policewoman had been injured had gathered a group to see if they could help keep order.
""It was us protecting everybody and, as it turned out, somebody on the other side ... I would do it for anybody and I would do it time and time again,"" he said.
The prince asked him how he felt seeing the continuing opposition to anti-racism protests.
""It's frustrating,"" said the father-of-four. ""It just makes you wonder why people find it so hard to understand what we're all striving for: the equality side of things.""

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>",Malaysia's PM Muhyiddin gets reprieve from key ally in political crisis,"By Joseph Sipalan
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The largest party in Malaysia's ruling coalition declared its support for Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, providing some respite for the premier who has faced calls to resign after a failed bid to impose a state of emergency. 
Muhyiddin, who has a razor thin majority in parliament, is under pressure from unhappy coalition partners who have demanded more powerful positions amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases and a pandemic-battered economy.
Calls for him to resign grew after the king on Sunday rejected his request for him to declare emergency rule amid a leadership challenge. Critics have accused the premier of using the pandemic as a pretext to suspend parliament and avoid a test of his majority.
The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party, which had earlier this month threatened to withdraw support for Muhyiddin, said it will now back him as the time has come for national reconciliation between political parties to ensure political stability and to focus efforts on managing the pandemic.
UMNO also said it will not work with opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's party, rejecting a proposal by former Malaysian premier and now-ruling party lawmaker Najib Razak.
Last month, Anwar declared that he had secured majority support from federal lawmakers to form a new government, sparking the political crisis.
In a Monday meeting of the former ruling Barisan Nasional coalition led by UMNO, Najib asked lawmakers in the alliance to endorse Anwar, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Najib's backing of Anwar marks a striking turnaround in their relationship. Anwar was one of the key leaders in a coalition that defeated Najib in a historic election in 2018.
Muhyiddin has maintained a tenuous alliance with UMNO, whose backing was key in his bid to secure the premiership in March after a bout of political wrangling led to the collapse of the administration led by veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad.

Leaders in UMNO, which had led the country for over 60 years until its defeat in a 2018 election, have balked at playing second fiddle to Muhyiddin's party. Some of UMNO's corruption-tainted leaders, including Najib, have been trying to revive their political fortunes.

In a letter to the prime minister, the MPs warned that his pandemic strategy of targeting local areas with restrictions was disproportionately damaging the economies of northern regions of the country and deepening the divide between the north and the wealthier south.
The MPs reminded Johnson of his promises to “level up” disadvantaged parts of the country, which helped persuade voters in former industrial heartlands last December to back his Tories instead of the opposition Labour Party many had supported for decades.
“Our constituents have been some of the worst affected by Covid, with many losing jobs and businesses,” the letter, coordinated by former minister Jake Berry, said. “We urge you to reflect carefully on our promise to people living in the north during the last election with the leveling-up agenda and make our region central to the country’s economic recovery.”
The MPs, all from northern, England, north Wales and the Scottish borders, called for a “clear roadmap” out of local lockdowns and a dedicated northern economic recovery plan, with investment in rail and other infrastructure projects.
Brexit Promises Catch Up With Boris Johnson in Covid Hotspots
For so many Tories to go public and back a coordinated set of demands shows the scale of disquiet in Johnson’s own party over his coronavirus strategy. The premier has been battling resistance from local leaders and mayors over his decision to impose strict restrictions on regions in the north including the city of Manchester.
Johnson insists that his policy of local lockdowns -- organized into three tiers of restrictions -- is better than hitting the entire country with a second economically disastrous national lockdown. But local politicians regard it as unfair and some Tories worry the strategy will cost them support.
“We are absolutely committed to leveling up across the country and building back better after coronavirus,” a spokesman for Johnson’s office said in a statement. “We stood at the last election on a solemn promise that we would improve people’s lives, and although the pandemic has meant 2020 is not the year we all hoped it would be, our ambitions for the country are unchanged.”

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 07:49PM ET</span>","Japan Ink: Growing tribe proudly defies tattoo taboo, hopes for Olympian boost","By Kim Kyung Hoon and Elaine Lies
TOKYO (Reuters) - Shodai Horiren got her first tattoo as a lark on a trip to Australia nearly three decades ago. Now, tattooed head to foot, even on her shaven scalp, she is one of Japan's most renowned traditional tattoo artists. 
""Your house gets old, your parents die, you break up with a lover, kids grow and go,"" said Horiren, 52, at her studio just north of Tokyo.
""But a tattoo is with you until you're cremated and in your grave. That's the appeal.""
Horiren belongs to a proud, growing tribe of Japanese ink aficionados who defy deeply-rooted taboos associating tattoos with crime, turning their skin into vivid palettes of colour with elaborate full-body designs, often featuring characters from traditional legends. 
(Click https://reut.rs/2HtXVfI to view a picture package of Japan's tattoo aficionados.)
Banned from spas, hot spring resorts, some beaches and many gyms and pools, the enthusiasts hope the presence of tattooed foreign athletes at last year's Rugby World Cup and next year's Tokyo Olympic Games - postponed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic - will help sweep away suspicion. 
""If you watch the All Blacks do the haka with all their tattoos, it makes your heart beat faster,"" said Horiren, referring to New Zealand's national rugby team and their pre-game ceremony. 
""Basketball players are really stylish, too. But here, even boxers cover up with foundation."" 
Tattoos have been linked to criminals for as long as 400 years, most recently to yakuza gang members, whose full-body ink-work stops short of hands and neck, allowing concealment under regular clothes. 
The popularity of Western rock music, though, with musicians increasingly sporting tattoos, has eaten away at this bias. 
A court decision last year that tattoos were for decoration, and were not medical procedures, helped clarify their murky legal status and may signal a shift in attitude - perhaps leading the industry to regulate itself, giving it a more mainstream image. 
Referring to them as tattoos rather than ""irezumi"" - literally meaning ""inserting ink"" - as is becoming more common, may also help give them a stylish, fashionable veneer. 
""Some people get tattoos for deep reasons, but I do it because they're cute, the same way I might buy a nice blouse,"" said Mari Okasaka, 48, a part-time worker who got her first tattoo at 28. Her 24-year-old son, Tenji, is working towards having his whole body covered in ink and colour. 
Tattoo devotees are edging into the open as well, meeting at large parties to bare and share their designs. 
""We may have tattoos but we are happy and bright people,"" said party organizer and scrapyard worker Hiroyuki Nemoto. 
Surfer and TV set-maker Takashi Mikajiri, though, is still stopped on some beaches and ordered to cover up. 
Rie Yoshihara, who works in a shop dressing tourists in kimonos, said her shocked father has still not seen her full back tattoo, while Okasaka wears long sleeves to take out the garbage so her neighbours won't talk. 
""In America, if you have a tattoo, people don't really care. There's not really any reaction,"" said Mikajiri. 

""That's the ideal. It'd be really good to just be taken for granted.""

1662,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 07:27PM ET</span>",Germany Warns of ‘Consequences’ If Thai King Breached Law,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany warned of “immediate consequences” if Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn broke the law on its soil as thousands of protesters gathered outside its embassy in Bangkok on Monday, stepping up the pressure in their campaign for changes to the monarchy.
The demonstrators submitted a letter questioning the king’s legal status in the European country and requesting Germany to probe whether he has exercised royal authority during his time there in violation of the country’s law. The petition is meant to help Thailand return “to the path of truthful constitutional monarchy,” according to a joint statement issued by protest organizers.
“We have not only been looking into that in recent weeks, but on a regular basis,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said at a news conference. “If there are things we consider to be illegal, that will have immediate consequences.”
The king, who is currently in Bangkok, spends much of his time in Germany. Calls to the Bureau of the Royal Household seeking comments went unanswered.
The march came as lawmakers began a debate on the pro-democracy demonstrations that pose a challenge to the royalist elite that has run Thailand for much of its history. The protesters want Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha to resign, changes to a constitution written after a 2014 coup and greater accountability and transparency for the monarchy -- the most powerful institution in the country.
Parliament Debate
Prayuth, who has ignored calls to quit, said on Monday parliament will consider the process of charter amendment next month with a target to wrap it up in three readings in December. But the new constitution will not come into force until extensive public hearings are concluded, he said. Lawmakers are set to meet again on Tuesday.
The prime minister has previously said the government is open to amending some unspecified parts of the constitution though parliament last month stalled the charter amendment process. Protesters say the constitution, which allows a military-appointed Senate to vote for the prime minister, was instrumental in helping Prayuth maintain power.
Sompong Amornwiwat, a leader of the opposition Pheu Thai Party, said Prayuth must resign to de-escalate the situation and urged the government to consider protesters’ demand for amending the constitution without any delay. He also called for the immediate release of arrested pro-democracy activists and an end to harassment of those opposed to the government.
The protesters said the parliament sitting was being used to insult and slander the anti-government movement. “If politics is good, there would be no protests today,” the Thammasat group said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The protesters also asked Germany to clarify if King Vajiralongkorn will be liable to pay inheritance tax given his long stay in the European country and investigate the human rights record of the monarch and his courtiers, a copy of the letter released by the pro-democracy groups show.
Frithjof Schmidt, a Green party lawmaker on the parliament’s foreign affairs committee, urged Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration to take a tougher line against the Thai government.
The German government, which currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, has to “take the initiative to freeze all trade negotiations with Thailand, as long as the military junta is blocking the path to democracy,” Schmidt told Bloomberg News.
Prayuth has struggled to quell the protest movement, forcing him to withdraw a state of emergency in the capital within a week of its imposition and asking protesters to “take a step back” to de-escalate the situation. But protesters rejected the olive branch and called for more protests.
Prayuth’s Performance
An opinion poll by Suan Dusit University showed that more than 62% of respondents felt discontent with Prayuth’s performance was the key reason for the escalating protest movement. Another survey by the National Institute of Development Administration showed 59% of the 1,336 respondents are worried the protests will lead to violence and conflict.
The Thai government may be drawn into a “prolonged stand-off with the protesters, coupled with the arrests and harassment of leaders, in hopes of the movement’s losing momentum,” said Christopher Ankersen, associate professor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies Center for Global Affairs.
If the government is forced to make some compromise, a drafting of a new constitution -- “a slow, long and arcane process” -- could be used to buy time, Ankersen said, adding that Prayuth’s resignation could also be on the table.

J. H. Binford Peay III, who had been the institute's superintendent for 17 years, told its board he was stepping down after learning on Friday that Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and ""certain legislative leaders had lost confidence in my leadership ... and desired my resignation.""
Peay's resignation, which the head of the state-sponsored college's governing board said he accepted ""regretfully,"" took effect on Monday.
""You have profoundly changed our school for the better,"" John William Boland, president of the school's Board of Visitors, said in a letter to Peay. A search for a successor would begin immediately, he added.
Northam's press secretary, Alena Yarmosky, said while the governor was grateful for Peay's service, the college now has ""the opportunity to counter-balance a long legacy with a clear-eyed view of the future.""
""Change is overdue at VMI, and the Board of Visitors bears a deep responsibility to embrace it,"" Yarmosky said in an email.
Last week, Northam and several top elected officials and lawmakers wrote to the board to express concern ""about the clear and appalling culture of ongoing structural racism"" at the college.
It cited ""horrifying new revelations"" reported by the Washington Post on Oct. 17 of social media attacks and threats of lynchings against Black cadets, and of a professor who spoke fondly of her family's history in the Ku Klux Klan.
The letter said the state would launch an independent review of the culture, policies and practices of the college, which has 1,700 cadets and is located in the remote western part of the state.

Boland replied that he welcomed the review, but said the incidents in the Post story, several of which were many years old, were isolated and not reflective of VMI's culture.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Abortion rights protests block city streets across Poland,"By Joanna Plucinska and Anna Koper
WARSAW (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Poles blocked city streets in cars, on bicycles and on foot on Monday on the fifth day of protests against a Constitutional Court ruling that amounts to a near-total ban on abortion in the predominantly Catholic country.
Carrying banners reading ""Enough"", ""I won't be your martyr"" and ""I want choice, not terror"", protesters gathered in several dozen towns and cities in defiance of coronavirus restrictions.
""I will be here until the end,"" said Piotr Wybanski, 31, in one of Warsaw's main thoroughfares. Speaking of his five sisters, mother and grandmother he said: ""I came here with my fiancee and I fight for all of them.""
""I need to fight for the future of my daughter,"" said Justyna, 37, who declined to give her family name.
Scuffles erupted between protesters and far-right groups who broke through a police cordon separating them in front a church elsewhere in Warsaw, prompting the police to use pepper spray. In the city of Wroclaw, abortion rights activists used flares. 
The court ruling last Thursday fuelled an unprecedented backlash against the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, which is seen as having close links with the conservative nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government. 
It has also heightened criticism of PiS, which came to power five years ago on a promise to instil more traditional values.
Crowds gathered again near the house of PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski in an affluent Warsaw neighbourhood, as police in vans with flashing lights kept them away and a helicopter hovered overhead.
After the ruling goes into effect, abortion will be banned in the case of foetal abnormalities and will be legal only in the case of rape, incest or a threat to the woman's health.
Critics say the court has acted on behalf of the party, which has in the past stepped back from efforts to tighten abortion rules. PiS denies that. 
The Constitutional Court was part of the government's sweeping overhaul of the justice system which the European Commission says subverted the rule of law by politicising courts. The government says the court is independent.
MILITARY POLICE
In the capital and elsewhere, groups formed around church buildings, with local media reporting far-right groups were gathering to protect them. Late in the evening, flares were launched close to the PiS headquarters in central Warsaw.
The government has called for a halt to the protests because of a rising number of coronavirus cases overwhelming the health care system, though except for isolated scuffles with the police the protests have been largely peaceful. 
""What's happening in recent days is absolutely unacceptable,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki's chief of staff, Michal Dworczyk, told private radio RMF. ""Pandemic rules are being broken.""
The government said military police would be called in to help enforce pandemic rules, which include an obligation to wear face masks in public, from Wednesday. The defence ministry said on Twitter the decision was not connected with the protests.
Poland recorded 10,241 new coronavirus cases on Monday, compared with a record of 13,632 on Friday.

More protests are planned across Poland later this week, including a mass gathering in Warsaw on Friday.

The 10,000 Black Interns project is based on a smaller programme that provided similar internships in the fund management industry.
Organisers said they had received support from employers in the accountancy, education, finance, legal, marketing and recruitment sectors, among others.
""This initiative will help build a more inclusive economy that works for everyone,"" Cameron said.
The programme also received backing from former Labour Party politicians and the Confederation of British Industry.
Internships restricted to Black applicants are rare in Britain. Diversity programmes in Britain's public sector are usually open to Asian and other minority ethnicity applicants, and sometimes to white applicants from poorer backgrounds.
Unadjusted figures from Britain's Office for National Statistics showed that in 2018, Black employees on average earned 9% less per hour than white British workers, while those of Chinese and Indian heritage earned 31% and 12% more respectively.
Black employees typically earned more than those with Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage.
These gaps narrowed but generally did not disappear when the figures were adjusted for workers' level of education, age, type of work and other factors, with a 7% shortfall remaining for British-born Black employees versus white British workers.

In the last census in 2011, 3.3% of the population in England and Wales identified as Black.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The military leader of Sudan's ruling council sought to defend on Monday a U.S.-backed agreement to establish relations with Israel, saying the deal was yet to be concluded and could benefit Sudan as it struggles with a profound economic crisis.
In his first public comments on the deal, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said he had consulted the prime minister and most political forces before the agreement was announced on Friday in a call with U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The move is controversial in Sudan, once a staunch enemy of Israel, and has stirred opposition from some prominent political factions.
""I always prefer to call it reconciliation instead of normalisation,"" Burhan said in a televised interview. ""So far, we have not concluded an agreement. We will sign with the other two parties, America and Israel, on the aspects of cooperation.""
Burhan leads a military-civilian sovereign council that took charge after the ouster of former president Omar al-Bashir last year following popular protests.
A government of technocrats has been grappling with an economic crisis that includes rapid inflation, a weakening currency, and shortages of essential goods.
Sudan won the prospect of some relief last week when the United States confirmed it would lift Khartoum from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation that had blocked international funding and debt relief.
Many Sudanese saw the move as unduly delayed and deployed to pressure Sudan into accepting the deal on Israel. 
""We were not subjected to blackmail,"" said Burhan. ""We lay down our interests and we found benefits, and it could be that we gain more than the other parties."" 
Burhan said tense relations with the civilian component of the sovereign council had improved recently, and that he had agreed with civilian political leaders that the deal on Israel should be approved by a yet-to-be formed legislative council.

Hamas arrested Rami Aman, 39, and seven other activists in April after the conference call, describing it as ""treason"". 
Such grassroots dialogue between Israelis and Gaza Palestinians is rare. 
While five of the activists were released within days of being arrested, Gaza military prosecutors charged Aman and two others with aiding Israel and ordered them jailed until their trial. One of the three was granted bail in July. 
A Hamas-run military court on Monday convicted all three of ""weakening revolutionary spirit"" but ordered authorities to release Aman and the other campaigner who had remained in jail. 
Speaking to Reuters soon after his release, Aman said he had told the court he was not calling for a normalisation of ties with Israel.
""I call for a just and comprehensive peace, and believe that as long as there is occupation, there will be resistance,"" Aman said, referring to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza. 
Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The military court handed Aman a one-year suspended sentence and ordered the other activist, whose name has not been made public, to be released on the basis of time served, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, which had defended them, said in a statement. 
Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 and has since fought three wars with Israel. Flare-ups along the shared border are relatively frequent. 
Israel regards Hamas as a terrorist group and keeps Gaza under blockade, saying its aim is to stop weapons from reaching militant groups.

The Vatican in June announced the beatification of Hernandez, a doctor known for treating the poor during the Spanish flu pandemic a century ago. The decree moves him a step closer to sainthood.
His remains were exhumed in a ceremony at a church in Caracas, to ""guarantee the prolonged preservation of his body,"" the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference said in a statement.
The exhumation will collect relics including skeletal remains and clothing, which will be distributed to dioceses in Venezuela, the Holy See and to sanctuaries created in other countries in honor of Hernandez.
Venezuelan Cardinal Baltazar Porras asked that the beatification ""be for us the path of reconciliation,"" in a ceremony before a small group of parishioners that was broadcast on state television.
Hernandez was born in the Andean state of Trujillo in 1864 and was known as the 'doctor of the poor' for visiting the sick in Caracas during the Spanish flu pandemic. 
He died in 1919 after being hit by a car.
Beatification by the Roman Catholic Church requires linking the prospective saint to a miracle, which usually takes the form of a healing it deems medically inexplicable. 
The church cited Yaxury Solorzano, a girl who in 2017 defied doctors' predictions that she would either die or be unable to walk and speak after being shot in the head following an attempted robbery. She was 10 years old at the time.
It said Solorzano's mother had prayed to Hernandez to save the life of her daughter, who walked out of the hospital several weeks later after fully recovering from her injuries.

PARIS/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan asked his compatriots to stop buying French goods on Monday in the latest expression of anger in the Muslim world over images being displayed in France of the Prophet Mohammad, which some Muslims consider blasphemous.
In Bangladesh on Monday, protesters held placards with a caricature of French President Emmanuel Macron and the words: ""Macron is the enemy of peace"", while Pakistan's parliament passed a resolution urging the government to recall its envoy from Paris.
Erdogan, who has a history of fraught relations with Macron, said France was pursuing an anti-Islam agenda.
""I am calling to all my citizens from here to never help French brands or buy them,"" Erdogan said.
The Turkish president has made similar boycott calls in the past, including an appeal not to buy U.S. electronic goods in 2018 that was not followed through.
Erdogan on Monday joined a chorus of voices calling for a boycott. In Kuwait city, a supermarket had stripped its shelves of L'Oreal cosmetics and skincare products after the cooperative union to which it belongs decided to stop stocking French goods.
In Saudi Arabia, calls for a boycott of French supermarket chain  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) were trending on social media, though two stores Reuters visited in the Saudi capital on Monday seemed as busy as normal. A company representative in France said it had yet to feel any impact.
France is a major exporter of grain to mainly-Muslim North Africa, and French companies in the autos and retail sector also have significant exposure to majority-Muslim countries 
French Trade Minister Franck Riester said it was too early to put a figure on the impact of the boycott campaign but so far it was limited and mainly affected French agricultural exports.
TEACHER BEHEADED
The row has its roots in a knife attack outside a French school on Oct. 16 in which an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin beheaded Samuel Paty, a 47-year-old teacher who had shown pupils cartoons of Mohammad in a civics lesson on freedom of speech.
The cartoons first appeared many years ago in the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, whose Paris office was attacked in 2015 by gunmen who killed 12 people.
Since the beheading, the caricatures have been projected onto a building in one city and people displayed them at protests around the country. Macron said he would redouble efforts to stop conservative Islamic beliefs subverting French values.
Some in the Muslim world saw this as an attack on their religion.
Saudi Arabia’s highest religious authority, the Council of Senior Scholars, said on Sunday that insulting prophets had nothing to do with freedom of expression and only ""served extremists who aim to spread hatred"". 
Qatar’s government issued a statement on Monday condemning what it described as populist rhetoric inciting the abuse of religions.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that insulting Muslims is an ""opportunistic abuse of freedom of speech. It only fuels extremism.""
Earlier, Erdogan had questioned Macron's mental health, prompting Paris to recall its ambassador in Ankara.
""What is the problem of this person called Macron with Muslims and Islam? Macron needs treatment on a mental level,"" Erdogan said in a speech on Saturday.
'WE WILL NOT GIVE IN'
France's government has stood firm in response to Muslim anger. In a Tweet on Sunday, Macron said France respected all differences in a spirit of peace but added: ""We will not give in, ever."" His foreign ministry urged foreign governments to dissociate themselves from boycott calls.
Macron on Monday met representatives of France's Muslim community. The meeting was behind closed doors and the Elysee Palace gave no detailed information on what was discussed.
One of those present, Mohamed Moussaoui, President of the French Council for the Muslim Faith, said delegates told Macron they opposed the boycott. 
But they also told Macron ""the Muslims of France are worried by discussions which seek to confuse them with terrorists,"" Moussaoui told French broadcaster BFM. 
Several of France's partners in the European Union rallied round the French leader.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Erdogan's remarks about Macron were unacceptable.

""Full solidarity with the President @EmmanuelMacron,"" Conte wrote on Twitter. ""Personal invective does not help the positive agenda that the EU wants to pursue with Turkey.""

In a statement released ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. election, Debra Tice appeared to be trying to play Pompeo off against U.S. President Donald Trump, who has stressed his desire to bring home Tice and other U.S. citizens detained abroad.
""Unfortunately for Austin, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is undermining the President's crucial outreach, refusing any form of direct diplomatic engagement with the Syrian government,"" she said. ""President Trump is committed to seeing Austin walk free, whereas Secretary Pompeo is willing to accept his continued detention.""
A Trump Administration official on Oct. 18 confirmed a newspaper report that a White House official visited Damascus this year for secret meetings with the Syrian government seeking the release of Tice and another U.S. citizen.
Asked on Oct. 21 about the report and whether Washington was ready to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria to secure their release, Pompeo said: ""We'll continue to work for the return not only of Austin, but of every American that's held. We're not going to change American policy to do that.""
""As the President said clearly, we don't pay for the return of hostages,"" Pompeo added, repeating long-standing U.S. policy.
About 600 U.S forces remain in northeastern Syria after a sharp reduction in troops that were initially there to drive Islamic State militants from their strongholds in the country.
Tice's mother characterized Pompeo's stance as ""in essence, there is nothing he is willing to do to bring my son home.""
She also said Trump ""can and should insist upon continuing the dialogue with the Syrian government.""
The State Department and White House national security council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel in planning a ""lockdown light"" that will focus on closing bars, restaurants and public events to slow a second wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany, Bild newspaper reported on Monday.
Shops will stay open, with some restrictions, under the plan and schools will keep operating, apart from in areas with particularly high numbers of cases, the mass-selling daily reported.
A government spokesman neither confirmed nor denied the report and said no final decisions had been made.
Infections have almost doubled in the past week in Germany and cases are also rising across Europe and large parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
But Merkel is eager to avoid a second total national lockdown that might threaten a fragile recovery in Europe's largest economy.
Earlier on Monday, Merkel's spokesman said the chancellor and the leaders of Germany's 16 states would meet to decide on additional curbs on Wednesday.
A government official said on condition of anonymity that the measures described by Bild as a ""lockdown light"" might not be enough and that state premiers and the chancellery would have to agree on even tougher restrictions.
Germany reported 8,685 new cases on Monday. Government sources quoted Merkel as saying that the situation was ""very, very serious"" and without additional containment measures the number of daily new cases could reach 30,000 next week.
""(The conference) will be to discuss what can be done to contain the spread of the virus soon,"" Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference. ""I expect decisions to be made.""
The Rottal-Inn district in Bavaria announced a two-week lockdown starting on Tuesday that will force its 120,000 residents to stay at home unless outings are absolutely necessary.
Officials there said the decision was made after a spike in coronavirus cases in the district to more than 200 per 100,000 inhabitants over seven days.
A second district - Berchtesgaden, 110km to the south in the Bavarian Alps - has been in lockdown since Oct. 20.

Germany's COVID-19 situation remains less serious than in other major European countries including Britain, France and Spain. France, which has imposed night-time curfews on major cities, reported a record 52,010 new confirmed infections on Sunday.

The National Assembly resolution, which is non-binding, came hours after the French ambassador in Islamabad was summoned to the foreign office for Pakistan to register its protest. 
The developments were the latest expression of anger in the Muslim world over France displaying images of the Prophet Mohammad that Muslims consider blasphemous.
The resolution expressed ""serious concern at the highly disturbing statements and hate-mongering, specially by leaders like President Macron, justifying unlawful provocation and insult to the sentiments of more than a billion Muslims"".
The resolution also urged the government to ask other Muslim countries to boycott French products.
Earlier, a foreign office statement said the French ambassador was summoned and told that ""Pakistan strongly condemned equating Islam with terrorism, for narrow electoral and political gains"".
Macron had paid tribute to a French history teacher who was beheaded by an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a class on freedom of speech.
On Sunday Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan took aim at Macron, saying he had attacked Islam by encouraging the display of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.
Small protests were held on Monday in the northwestern city of Peshawar and the eastern city of Lahore, where participants burnt the French flag and raised slogans against France and Macron.
The president of the All Pakistan Traders Association, Ajmal Baloch, told Reuters TV in Islamabad that his organisation was getting in touch with traders across the country to take French products off the shelves.
Baloch said that the association would arrange a protest and march towards the French embassy on Friday.

The cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, first published in 2005 by Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, have long been a sensitive topic among Muslims, stirring protests in Pakistan and elsewhere.

Cyprus was split after a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. The European Union admitted the island into the bloc in 2004, represented by the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government in the south.
Its north is a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state only recognised by Ankara.
The latest attempt at reunification between the two Cypriot sides collapsed in disarray in mid-2017. Both sides blamed each other for the collapse, and Ankara accuses the EU of violating laws by only admitting Greek Cypriots.
Speaking at a news conference with Turkish Cypriot President Ersin Tatar in Ankara, Erdogan said the approach of Greek Cypriots had blocked previous attempts to find a solution.
""It must be understood that no result can be achieved under the current parameters following a negotiation process that has lasted more than half a century,"" Erdogan said.
""At this stage, we believe starting talks on the basis of a federation will be a loss of time. Therefore, we believe a two-state solution must now be brought to the table with a realistic proposal.""
Turkey has said before a two-state mechanism is needed to solve the Cyprus issue, but has accused the Greek Cypriot government of not engaging in talks.
Tatar said a Turkish proposal to hold an informal meeting between Turkey, Northern Cyprus, Greek Cypriots, Greece and the United Nations was ""the last chance"" for an agreement. 
Earlier this month, Northern Cyprus partially reopened the beach town of Varosha, a fenced-off resort area abandoned in no-man's land since 1974, a move criticised by the United States, Greece and Greek Cypriots.
Erdogan, who said he would visit Northern Cyprus on Nov. 15, said he wanted to have a picnic in Varosha.
""I believe it would be beneficial to have a picnic there all together,"" he said. ""We are watching from our screens here, but we want to experience it in person. God willing, we will do that too.""

Raggi became the Eternal City's first-ever woman mayor when she was elected in 2016 in a major breakthrough for her party, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which now governs nationally. She is running for re-election next year.
She said in a pre-recorded television interview that the Casamonica family, notorious for its criminal activity, had targeted her after she demolished some of their illegally built villas in 2018, forcing her to live with a police escort.
""We have been informed that they were planning an attack against me and my family,"" she added, without giving further details.
Raggi said she was also fighting other powerful mob families that operated in various quarters of Rome, such as the Spada family in the seaside neighbourhood of Ostia and the Marando family in San Basilio, on Rome's eastern outskirts.
""There are parts of Rome where people come close to me to tell me to keep on fighting but then they move away because they are afraid of being seen by the clans,"" she said in the interview on Canale 5.
Raggi has had a rocky time as mayor, with her first years in office dogged by legal difficulties and numerous defections from her city government. 
In 2018 she was found not guilty of charges that she lied over the appointment of the city's head of tourism, a job that went to the brother of one of her closest aides.

Prosecutors appealed against the acquittal and a new verdict is expected in the next few months.

Kabuga, who was on the run for 22 years until his arrest in France in May, will soon be brought before a judge, the United Nations tribunal said in a statement.
Last week a U.N. judge ordered his transfer to the Netherlands, rather than to a U.N. detention unit in Tanzania, out of health considerations amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Kabuga, 84, is likely to spend at least several months in The Hague and could then still be tried in Tanzania.
U.N. prosecutors accuse the former tea and coffee tycoon of bankrolling and importing machetes for ethnic Hutu militias which killed hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda during a 100-day period in 1994.
Kabuga faces allegations of genocide, complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity. He has dismissed accusations against him as “lies” during French extradition hearings.
Separately, Dutch prosecutors said on Monday they had arrested a 71-year-old Rwandan man who had been living in the Netherlands for 20 years, after receiving a request for his extradition from authorities in Kigali.
The man's name was not released, but prosecutors described him in a statement as a former banker and pharmacy owner accused of having prepared a list of Tutsis to be killed by militias in 1994.

""In view of the worsening epidemiological situation in Europe, the foreign ministry recommends that all compatriots avoid travelling abroad except for strictly necessary reasons,"" said a statement said on the ministry's website. 
""It should also be noted that given the high number of infections in many European countries, further restrictions on travel in the future cannot be excluded, which would risk complicating any return to Italy.""
The ministry further warned of the dangers of travelling beyond Europe. ""Similar repatriation problems could occur, with much more serious consequences, in case of travel to non-EU destinations,"" it said.
The Italian government helped repatriate almost 100,000 citizens earlier in the year after they were stranded abroad as borders were closed around the world amid coronavirus fears.
Many travel restrictions were eased after the initial viral wave subsided, but cases have risen sharply again this month in many countries including Italy. 
In a new record, almost half a million new coronavirus infections were recorded globally in a 24-hour period during the weekend, according to Reuters data.

There have been mounting protests in Italy against intensified restrictions meant to curb coronavirus contagion, and officials said the government would present a package of measures on Tuesday to shore up damaged businesses.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will sign a military agreement with the United States for sharing of sensitive satellite data, the defence ministry said on Monday, as the two sides began a top-level security dialogue aimed at countering China's growing power in the region.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper flew into New Delhi for talks with Indian leaders at a time when India is locked in its most serious military standoff with China at the disputed Himalayan border in decades.
Washington, for its part, has also ramped the diplomatic pressure on China, as ties worsen over a range of issues from Beijing's handling of the coronavirus to its imposition of a new security law in Hong Kong and ambitions in the South China Sea.
Ahead of the formal two-plus-two talks on Tuesday involving top diplomats and military officials, Esper met his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh and the two men discussed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation that is ready for signing, the Indian defence ministry said.
""The two ministers expressed satisfaction that agreement of BECA will be signed during the visit,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
The accord would provide India with access to a range of topographical, nautical and aeronautical data that is considered vital for targeting of missiles and armed drones.
It would also allow the United States to provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on U.S.-supplied aircraft to India, an Indian defence source said.
U.S. companies have sold India more than $21 billion of weapons since 2007 and Washington has been urging the Indian government to sign agreements allowing for sharing of sensitive information and encrypted communications for better use of the high-end military equipment.
Esper also welcomed Australia's participation in next month's naval exercises involving India, United States and Japan off the Bay of Bengal.
China has previously opposed such multilateral wargames, seeing them as aimed against it and India had long resisted expanding them for that reason. 
But the border tension with China this summer, which erupted in a clash killing 20 Indian soldiers, has hardened the public mood against Beijing and is driving closer ties with the United States, analysts say.
""Our talks today were fruitful, aimed at further deepening defence cooperation in a wide range of areas,"" Singh said in a tweet.
Pompeo separately met Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. There was no immediate word on that meeting. 

After India, Pompeo will travel to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, two Indian Ocean countries where China has financed and built various infrastructure, to the alarm of India and the United States.

SOUTHAMPTON, England (Reuters) - Seven men have been arrested on suspicion of seizing control of a ship, British police said on Monday after special forces stormed an oil tanker under threat from a group of stowaways the previous evening. 
The tanker's operator thanked the British authorities, saying help was requested after seven stowaways who had boarded in Lagos, Nigeria, turned hostile.
Troops from the Special Boat Service, Britain's elite naval special forces unit, boarded the Greek-operated Nave Andromeda near the Isle of Wight off southern England after the master of the ship said he was concerned about the safety of his crew.
""The seven men have been arrested on suspicion of seizing or exercising control of a ship by use of threats or force,"" police said. The men are in police custody.
Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel authorised the armed forces to board the tanker ""to safeguard life and secure a ship that was subject to suspected hijacking"", the defence ministry said.
Sources with knowledge of the situation aboard the vessel said it was not a hijacking or hostage taking. 
""The UK authorities had been advised by the Master that stowaways had been found on board and that he was concerned for the safety of the crew due to the increasingly hostile behaviour of the stowaways,"" Athens-based Navios Tanker Management said.
""Happily no crew members were injured and all are safe and well,"" it said. ""Navios Tanker Management wish to thank all the UK Authorities involved in this operation for their timely and professional response.""
The seven were detained in the operation involving the SBS, the navy, coastguard and police.
""Navios would also like to pay tribute to the Master of the Nave Andromeda for his exemplary response and calmness and to all the crew for their fortitude in a difficult situation,"" the ship operator said.
The defence ministry declined to confirm or deny the involvement of the SBS - in line with British government policy of not commenting on special forces operations.
But a source with knowledge of the matter said the SBS were involved. SBS operations are usually classified.

Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian vowed last week Beijing would respond to the U.S. action, which was announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and followed an initial crackdown on Chinese media outlets in the United States in March.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chileans will begin the process of penning a new constitution on Monday following a landslide vote that saw millions of citizens in the world´s top copper producer vote in favor of rewriting its rulebook.
More than 7.5 million of 14.97 eligible Chileans voted in a referendum on Sunday, the electoral authority said, the largest turnout since Chile adopted voluntary voting in 2012.
Of those, 78% opted in favor of constitutional overhaul with more than 99% of votes counted, a stinging rebuke of the constitution dating from the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.
The vote was a central demand of mass protests over inequality in late 2019. Four fifths of voters said they wanted the new charter to be drafted by a specially-elected body of citizens - made up of half women and half men - over a mixed convention of lawmakers and citizens, highlighting general mistrust in Chile's political class.
A 155-seat convention of citizens will be elected in April and have up to a year to agree a draft text, with proposals approved by a two-thirds majority. Chileans will then vote again on whether they accept the text or want to revert to the previous constitution.
People poured into the streets and plazas of cities throughout Chile in celebration. Scattered incidents of violence and looting in Santiago and elsewhere marred the festivities but did not dominate them.
""Chile gave a demonstration in civility,"" Interior Minister Víctor Perez told reporters on Monday. ""The vast majority of Chileans prefer the paths of democracy and institutionality.""
Maria Luz Navarrete, a 71-year old pensioner from Santiago, said she felt the vote was a last and necessary effort to turn the page on Pinochet.
""The referendum now becomes our challenge. We can´t let our guard down,"" she said.
Among issues likely to be at the fore are recognition of Chile's Mapuche indigenous population, powers of collective bargaining, water and land rights and privatized systems providing healthcare, education and pensions. 

Sonami, an industry group representing Chile´s mining industry, said it hoped for ""broad agreement"" around principles that would allow mining companies regulatory certainty.

France is the 10th biggest source of imports into Turkey and the seventh biggest market for Turkey's exports, according to Turkey's statistical institute. Among major French imports, French autos are among the highest selling cars in Turkey.
Shares in the Turkish unit of French-American telecoms equipment company Alcatel Lucent (IS:ALCTL) were down 10% on the Istanbul stock exchange after Erdogan's comments.
""European leaders with foresight and morals must break down the walls of fear,"" Erdogan said in a speech at the start of a week of activities in Turkey to commemorate the birthday of the Prophet Mohammad. 
""They must put an end to the anti-Islam agenda and hate campaign that Macron is leading.""
Macron has pledged to fight ""Islamist separatism"", saying it was threatening to take over some Muslim communities in France. The country has since been shaken by the beheading of a teacher by an Islamist militant, avenging the use of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression.

Turkey and France are both members of the NATO military alliance, but have been at odds over issues including Syria and Libya, maritime jurisdiction in the eastern Mediterranean, and the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",Mali and France at odds over talks with Islamist militants,"BAMAKO (Reuters) - Mali's interim prime minister said on Monday he was open to talks with Islamist militants whose insurgency has made vast swathes of the country ungovernable, but former colonial power France signalled opposition to the idea. 
Ousted former president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita said earlier this year that his government was prepared to negotiate with al Qaeda-linked militants. National talks in the aftermath of the August coup that overthrew Keita endorsed that policy. 
Malian officials have provided few specifics about what kinds of compromises could emerge, but some proponents of negotiations have said they could include recognition of a greater role for Islam in public life. 
Moctar Ouane, who was appointed interim prime minister last month to manage an 18-month transition after the Aug. 18 coup that toppled Keita, said his government was prepared to pursue talks. 
""The conclusions of the inclusive national talks ... very clearly indicated the necessity of an offer of dialogue with these armed groups,"" Ouane said at a news conference in Bamako with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian who is on a two-day visit.
""We need to see in that an opportunity to engage in far-reaching discussions with the communities in order to redefine the contours of a new governance of the areas that are concerned,"" he said. 
Le Drian, however, indicated he was opposed, noting that the Islamist groups had not signed a 2015 peace deal that it considers a framework for restoring peace to northern Mali. 
""Let's say things very clearly: there are peace accords ... and then there are terrorist groups that have not signed the peace accords,"" Le Drian said. ""It is simple."" 
France has more than 5,000 troops in Mali and neighbouring countries in West Africa's Sahel region to fight the jihadists, against whom it first intervened in 2013. 
But the militants, many with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State, have grown stronger in recent years, stepping into vacuums left by weakened state authorities.

The executive committee agreed it could not hold the meeting, which it had planned to stage in the southwestern city of Stuttgart, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.
""The current situation would not allow a party conference on December 4,"" Ziemiak told reporters.
The upshot is that the timing of the election of a new CDU leader by 1,001 delegates is now unclear. 
Whoever is elected to the role will be in pole position to succeed Merkel, in power since 2005, as chancellor. She has said she will not seek re-election in federal elections due by October 2021. 
Senior party sources said a decision on the new chancellor candidate to represent the conservative alliance of the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), could no longer be decided before state elections in March.
Ziemiak said the CDU executive committee would, if possible, decide at a Dec. 14 meeting on how to proceed on the congress, reviewing options including a digital party conference, though this would likely require a constitutional amendment.
The committee could also decide on the format at a meeting it plans to hold in mid-January. A digital party conference with a subsequent postal vote was also conceivable. 
""There is a consensus that a party conference with physical presence would be the best option,"" Ziemiak told reporters. 
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in February she no longer wanted to succeed Merkel and would stand down as CDU leader.

So far, Armin Laschet, premier of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, erstwhile Merkel rival Friedrich Merz, and foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen are running to be chairman.

ON BOARD JS KAGA (Reuters) - Japan and the United States on Monday began air, sea and land exercises around Japan in a show of force in the face of increased Chinese military activity in the region.
The Keen Sword exercise is the first big drill since Yoshihide Suga became Japan's prime minister last month with a vow to continue the military build-up aimed at countering China, which claims Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea.
Keen Sword, which is held every two years, involves dozens of warships, hundreds of aircraft and 46,000 soldiers, sailors and marines from Japan and the United States. Running until to Nov. 5 it will include cyber and electronic warfare training for the first time.
""The security situation around Japan has become increasingly severe. This gives us the opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the Japan-U.S. alliance,"" General Koji Yamazaki, Japan's top military commander said on board the Kaga helicopter carrier in waters south of Japan. 
Japan's biggest warship was accompanied by U.S. aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan and its escort destroyers. The 248 metre (814 ft) Kaga, which was returning from patrols in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, will be refitted as early as next year to carry F-35 stealth fighters.
Suga this month visited Vietnam and Indonesia as part of Japan’s efforts to bolster ties with key Southeast Asian allies. That followed a meeting in Tokyo of the “Quad”, an informal grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States that Washington sees as a bulwark against China’s growing regional influence. Beijing as denounced it as a “mini-NATO” aimed at containing it.
Japan has grown particularly concerned about an uptick in Chinese naval activity around the disputed islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo claims as the Senkaku and Diaoyu in Beijing.
Accompanying Gen Yamazaki on the Kaga, Lieutenant General Kevin Schneider, commander of U.S. Forces Japan pointed to recent activity by China that worried Washington and Tokyo, including new security laws in Hong Kong that had undermined the territory's autonomy, China's military build up in the South China Sea and harassment of Taiwan by the Chinese military over the past few months. 

China has said it intentions in the region are peaceful.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 08:22AM ET</span>",Malaysia's PM faces calls to quit after failed bid for emergency rule,"By Joseph Sipalan
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin faced calls to resign on Monday as doubts swirled over the support that he commands, after the king rejected his request to declare a state of emergency to fight the coronavirus epidemic.
Muhyiddin had requested emergency rule amid a fresh spike in infections in Malaysia and a global pandemic that has battered the economy. But critics accused him of using it as a pretext to suspend parliament and avoid a test of his razor-thin parliamentary majority.
King Al-Sultan Abdullah's refusal is seen further eroding Muhyiddin's grip on power, a month after opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said he has majority support in parliament, including from defectors from the ruling alliance, to form a new government.
Turning down Muhyiddin's request on Sunday, the king also asked politicians to end any politicking that could destabilise a government that he said has handled the pandemic well, and stressed the importance of the 2021 budget scheduled to be set before parliament on Nov. 6.
But leaders of other parties in Muhyiddin's coalition and the opposition criticised his move to seek emergency powers and called on him to step down after the bid failed. 
""Thankfully, His Majesty the King was not influenced by the political game that could drag the country into more critical territory,"" said Ahmad Puad Zarkashi, a senior leader in the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) - the largest party in the ruling coalition - said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
""The people's wellbeing is more important. By right, Muhyiddin should step down,"" Ahmad Puad said. 
Opposition lawmaker Wong Chen said Muhyiddin's ""malicious"" proposal was rightfully rejected by the king, and that the premier should resign or fire ministers who proposed the emergency.
The Southeast Asia nation was plunged into political instability in late February following the resignation of the previous prime minister, veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad, after his coalition broke apart, and former ally Muhyiddin forged a new alliance with UMNO to become prime minister.
Within weeks, Muhyiddin was faced with the coronavirus crisis, but the new ruling coalition is also beset with infighting, with UMNO seeking to exert more influence. And some of the UMNO's corruption tainted leaders, notably former prime minister Najib Razak, have been trying to revive their political fortunes. 
Some in UMNO have called for polls to resolve the crisis, but others are opposed to holding an election due to the pandemic.
In response to speculation, Ismail Sabri, senior minister of security, said a dissolution of parliament that would lead to elections was not discussed in a special cabinet meeting held on Monday. 
The country's politicians, however, could be influenced by the king's call to avoid politicking, and put the nation's needs first, analysts said.
""The King appears to be sending a signal that the government of the day will hold, and that the Budget should be passed, and there should not be any political changes, at least for the time being,"" Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, a senior associate with political and policy risk consultancy Vriens & Partners, said.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 08:22AM ET</span>",Thai protesters march on German embassy to seek probe of king,"By Jiraporn Kuhakan and Patpicha Tanakasempipat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters marched on the German embassy in Bangkok on Monday to ask for an investigation of the Thai king's activities during stays in Germany, as months of protests give rise to growing calls for reforms of the monarchy.
Germany has said it would be unacceptable for King Maha Vajiralongkorn to conduct politics in Germany and Foreign Minister Heiko Mass said the European country continued to look into his behaviour during long sojourns in Bavaria.
Student-led protests that began by demanding the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former military ruler, have also become the biggest challenge in decades to a monarchy that the Thai constitution says must be revered.
""We have three demands - first that the PM must resign, second that we want a new constitution from the people not the government and third we want to reform the monarchy,"" said one 16-year-old student protester who declined to be named.
Criticising the monarchy can mean a 15-year jail sentence in Thailand, but the protests have swept away the longstanding taboo on discussing it.
Protesters accuse the monarchy of helping to enable decades of domination by military rulers. They also complain about spending on the king's European visits at a time the coronavirus has hit the tourism-reliant economy hard.
The political crisis in Thailand has also made the king's presence a challenge for Germany.
""We are monitoring this long-term,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. ""It will have immediate consequences if there are things that we assess to be illegal.""
In a special session of the Thai parliament to address the crisis, opponents of Prime Minister Prayuth urged him to stop using the monarchy to justify his hold on power and resign.
""Please resign and everything will end well,"" said Sompong Amornvivat, leader of the opposition Pheu Thai party.
Members of the opposition Move Forward party accused Prayuth of trying to use the monarchy to keep power - particularly regarding an incident around a royal motorcade that was used to justify tough emergency measures on Oct. 15.
The emergency measures, now lifted, backfired when tens of thousands of people took to the streets.
Prayuth rejected a demand from protesters to step down and said last week it was his government's job to protect the monarchy.
""I’m confident that today, regardless of our different political views, everyone still loves the country,"" Prayuth said in his opening address.
Prayuth seized power in a 2014 coup and protesters accuse him of engineering last year's election to retain the army's grip on power. He says the election was fair.

Before the protesters marched on the embassy, a couple of dozen royalists assembled there, shouting: ""Long live the king. We will protect him with our lives.""

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 07:58AM ET</span>",Special Report: U.S. jails are outsourcing medical care — and the death toll is rising,"By Jason Szep, Ned Parker, Linda So, Peter Eisler and Grant Smith
SAVANNAH, Georgia (Reuters) - Matthew Loflin was coughing up blood, struggling to breathe and losing consciousness in his cell while awaiting trial on drug-possession charges in this historic Southern city.
“I need to go to the hospital,” he told his mother in a jailhouse phone call. “I’m gonna die in here.”
It was March 28, 2014, and his seven weeks at the Chatham County Detention Center had been a blur of blackouts and racing heartbeats.
The jail’s senior medical staff – Dr. Charles Pugh and two well-credentialed nurses – agreed he needed hospitalization. But the move was opposed by a senior manager at their employer, Corizon Health Inc, which held a multi-million dollar contract to manage the jail’s healthcare, according to court records and former medical staff.
When Loflin's X-ray showed a suspicious spot in his chest on April 7, Pugh tried another plan: He sent Loflin to a cardiologist, believing the specialist would want him hospitalized. After a quick exam, the cardiologist sent him straight to the hospital, but it was too late. Loflin, 32, deteriorated quickly, suffering irreversible brain damage. He died April 24.
His death was the second in two months that Pugh and nurses Betty Riner and Lynne Williams (NYSE:WMB) considered preventable, internal jail memos and emails produced in litigation show. That August, the trio met with the sheriff and accused Corizon of prioritizing profits over lives.
Corizon fired all three, triggering a wrongful termination lawsuit settled on confidential terms. The plaintiffs agreed not to discuss their allegations.
Reuters corroborated their claims about faulty care at the jail in this city of antebellum homes and moss-covered oaks. The story of deadly neglect was assembled through previously unreported whistleblower testimony, thousands of court and police documents, interviews with more than a dozen former medical and jail staff, and confidential monitor reports.
In the last years of Corizon’s watch from 2014 to 2016, prescription drugs went missing, patients deemed gravely ill by medical staff were denied hospitalization, mentally ill inmates went untreated and records were falsified, Reuters found. Weeks passed with no doctor on site, leaving care to nurses and video calls with doctors. The jail’s 400 mentally ill inmates, nearly a quarter of its population, were treated by a sole psychiatrist. Corizon said it put patient care first and told its staff to hospitalize inmates when needed.
Yet an inmate died from a treatable heart condition after his doctor’s requests for hospitalization were denied. A guard was crippled by an inmate who hadn’t gotten her meds. Another inmate died from a blood clot in his leg 32 hours after he crawled across the floor begging to go to the hospital.
The Savannah jail’s breakdowns speak to a national trend. More than 60% of America’s top jails now hire private companies to deliver inmates’ medical care, Reuters found, and that shift has taken a toll: more dead.
A Reuters review of deaths in more than 500 jails found that, from 2016 to 2018, those relying on one of the five leading jail healthcare contractors had higher death rates than facilities where medical services are run by government agencies. The analysis assessed deaths from illness and medical conditions, suicide, and the acute effects of drugs and alcohol.
Jails with publicly managed medical services, usually run by the sheriff’s office or local health department, had an average of 12.8 deaths per 10,000 inmates in that time. Jails with healthcare provided by one of the five companies had an additional 2.3 to 7.4 annual deaths per 10,000 inmates. The death rates were 18% to 58% higher, depending upon the company.
The Reuters review is the most definitive examination to date revealing the risks that have emerged as hundreds of jails have embraced the multi-billion dollar correctional healthcare industry and its promises of quality care and controlled costs. It is part of a larger Reuters examination finding that two-thirds of dead inmates, including Loflin, never got their day in court for the alleged offenses on which they were held.
Corizon, among the nation’s biggest correctional healthcare companies, now manages care for some 116,000 prisoners in state and county facilities at more than 140 locations in 15 states.
In an interview, Corizon Chief Executive James Hyman said jail death rates alone were not a valid indicator of “the quality of performance … in what is a very complex population set.” He said the Reuters findings did not take into account the challenges of providing care to two distinct groups of inmates: Those who stay less than a month in jail and those who cannot afford bail or are serving post-conviction sentences.
In Savannah, Corizon was eventually replaced by another contractor amid a series of deaths. Corizon said it never sacrificed care for profits. “I would not have operated in or stayed in that kind of environment,” said Dr. Calvin Johnson, the Tennessee company’s chief medical officer from 2014 to 2016.
Hyman said Corizon’s statisticians did not believe the variance in death rates for jails contracting with Corizon was “statistically significant.” While every jail death is “significant,” the company disputed Reuters’ methodology and “resulting assumptions.”
Many factors can contribute to a jail’s mortality rate, such as the overall health of its population and the size of its budget, and it is impossible to account for all such variables with publicly available data. But even after adjusting for the size of the jail and the area’s mortality rate, Reuters and two independent statisticians still found statistically significant disparities between jails with publicly provided medical care and those with healthcare managed by one of the top contractors.
AN INDUSTRY RISES
Until the 1970s, jail healthcare was minimal. Most lockups offered little more than first aid, a 1972 American Medical Association survey found.
Then, in 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that “deliberate indifference” to an inmate’s medical needs amounts to “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,” violating the Eighth Amendment. Inmates began suing, and in the 1980s the correctional healthcare industry emerged.
The industry expanded through the 1990s and early 2000s as a push to deinstitutionalize the mentally ill spurred the closure of mental health hospitals – sending many former patients to the streets, and then jail.
By 2010, nearly half the U.S. jails surveyed by Reuters had turned to privatized medical care. By 2018, 62% got privatized services.
Today, a handful of companies dominate the jail healthcare business: Wellpath Holdings Inc, NaphCare Inc, Corizon, PrimeCare Medical Inc, and Armor Correctional Health Services Inc. The largest, Wellpath, is owned by a private equity firm. An investment firm owns Corizon. NaphCare, PrimeCare and Armor are privately owned.
“It makes sense to have someone whose specialty is to come in and take care of inmates,” said Chatham County Commissioner Helen Stone. “Saving money,” she said, is key.
Many sheriffs have embraced the chance to shed the headaches of managing their own medical operations. “It is a package deal and everything is done for you,” said Captain Jessica Pete, whose facility, the St. Louis County Jail in Duluth, Minnesota, hired regional contractor MEnD Correctional Care in 2012. “We are getting fantastic care.”
Yet even as the industry’s reach expanded, no large-scale studies have been conducted to assess privatization’s impact on inmate mortality. To answer that question, Reuters surveyed 523 jails for healthcare and death data from 2008 to 2019. It explored all U.S. jails with 750 or more inmates, plus the 10 largest jails in nearly every state.
From 2010 to 2015, death rates were generally similar in jails using the big healthcare contractors and those with publicly managed care.
But from 2016 to 2018, the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics are available, the death rates diverged. Jails using the major companies had 691 fatalities among an average total population of 138,000 inmates in that three-year span. By contrast, jails using publicly managed care had 587 fatalities while caring for more than 152,000 inmates.
To be sure, some publicly run systems suffer high death rates. But on balance, Reuters found, death rates are higher when healthcare is in the hands of private industry.
Overall, facilities with care managed by the biggest jail medical providers had 17 deaths per 10,000 inmates, compared to 13 deaths in publicly-run units.
Contracts with private providers sometimes lack quantified standards for care, Reuters found, such as staffing requirements or protocols for inmate health evaluations or hospitalizations. Such problems can occur in publicly run systems, but they aren’t locked into contracts or dependent upon profits.
Size can also play a role. Big jurisdictions are more likely to have publicly managed inmate care under the aegis of a health department, Reuters found. Small to midsize counties, often operating with tight budgets, are more likely to hire private firms.
“You’ve got counties being greedy, not wanting to spend money on medical care, and companies saying, ‘We can do this, we can do it cheaper for you,’” said Dr. Robert Greifinger, former chief medical officer for the New York State Department of Correctional Services. “How do companies achieve those economies? Part of it is being stingy with care.”
AN EXORCISM IN OKLAHOMA
Jails where NaphCare and Armor operated had the highest death rates in the three-year period – 20.2 and 18.8 deaths per 10,000 inmates, respectively. Rates for the other companies were 16 for Corizon, 15.9 for Wellpath, 15.1 for PrimeCare.
NaphCare said it “has never compromised patient care for profit and we never will.” In an interview, CEO Brad McLane said his family-owned company shields itself from pressure from outside investors as it operates in counties with “the biggest challenges,” such as opioid outbreaks.
Jails often hire contractors when they hit a crisis, and comparing death rates in those facilities to other jails is “apples to oranges,” said Wellpath President Kip Hallman. “We’re sort of like firemen,” he added, saying Wellpath typically boosts staffing and spending on inmate care.
PrimeCare Medical said it often takes over for government agencies. “In every one we have been informed that we provide a more comprehensive and better healthcare system,” said CEO Thomas J. Weber.
The Oklahoma County Jail, which had been under Justice Department monitoring since 2009 amid concerns over overcrowding and lax inmate supervision, was among those served by Armor.
From 2009 to 2018, 54 inmates under Armor’s medical and mental health care there died from medical conditions, suicide or addictions.
In one case, the sheriff barred an Armor nurse for allegedly attempting an “exorcism” on an inmate suffering a fatal methamphetamine overdose. The nurse denied the accusation and filed an ongoing lawsuit against the sheriff and Armor for defamation and wrongful termination.
Armor said its health services “meet or exceed” industry standards.
“What statistics can’t explain, and many in the public do not know, is that the first day ‘behind bars’ for most of our patients is the first time they receive essential medications, medical care, and behavioral healthcare,” Armor wrote. Inmates bring “incomparably unique healthcare challenges.”
Some industry adversaries say companies have an incentive to cut costs. “It is a one to one, dollar to dollar, relationship between denying care and profit,” said Savannah lawyer Will Claiborne, who represented Loflin’s family in a lawsuit against the jail and Corizon that settled last year.
In 2011, Corizon’s predecessor company spent about $113,000 a month sending inmates to the hospital, or more than $1.3 million a year, including ambulance fees, financial records disclosed in litigation show. The next year, under Corizon, the cost shrunk by about 53%, records show. With fewer inmates sent out for care, Corizon’s jail profit margin soared – from 14.6% in 2011 to 21.5% in 2012 and 24.2% in 2013. Reuters did not have access to annual data in later years.
For 2013 and 2014 combined, Corizon paid a total $1.5 million for outside medical services involving 333 inmates at the Savannah jail, including more than 400 ER visits, the company said. “Any suggestion that we routinely deny care that may require outside services is simply not based in fact.”
The county had opened a new jail infirmary, Corizon added, so “there was an expectation from the client” that hospital visits would decline.
AN OVERWHELMED PSYCHIATRIST
The Chatham County Detention Center is 600,000 square feet of beige concrete filled with 1,500 to 1,800 inmates. Circled with razor wire and tucked between a busy parkway and a forested patch of swampland, it’s a world apart from the oak-lined streets of historic Savannah miles away.
Corizon's predecessor company, Prison Health Services, won the contract in 1992. Two decades later, Corizon was earning $5 million a year when then-Sheriff Al St. Lawrence sought an official seal of approval from the Medical Association of Georgia.
“I want that accreditation,” St. Lawrence, who died in 2015, told a jail manager. To get it, the jail had to show that new inmates got timely access to medications.
Psychiatrist George Hall, 84, struggled to keep pace. Nurses said they wrote prescription renewals themselves and put them on Hall’s desk to be signed without the doctor seeing the inmate, a prohibited practice under Georgia law for many psychotropic drugs and controlled medications.
By May 2014, a year before Hall died, some 120 inmates were on a waiting list for medical or psychiatric consults, three former workers said.
One was Sheena Burton, arrested May 3, 2014, for missing court on a traffic charge. She said she suffered from bipolar disorder, depression and multiple personality disorder, and told nurses she took the antipsychotic drug Zyprexa. She wasn’t given medication, jail records show. On May 12, she became violent. Deputies strapped her into a restraint chair.
Nurse Riner put Burton, then 28, on a computer list of patients waiting to see the psychiatrist for medication. Days later, Riner discovered Burton’s name wasn’t on the list. Riner later testified that colleagues told her names were deleted from the list so the backlog wouldn’t undermine the jail’s accreditation. Corizon denied any deletions and declined further comment.
Soon, Burton’s emotions were “like a firecracker,” she said in an interview. One day, she stopped at a water fountain when a guard, Wendy Smoot-Lee, ordered her back in line. Tensions escalated: The women, each more than 200 pounds, tumbled to the floor in a brawl.
Smoot-Lee suffered nerve damage requiring back surgery. “My whole life is changed,” she said. Unable to stand without a cane or a walker, she lives on workers’ compensation.
She sued Corizon for negligence in its handling of Burton’s healthcare, an allegation the company denies. She also sued Burton for causing her physical harm, but told Reuters, “It wasn't her fault. She needed her medication.” Burton admits punching Smoot-Lee, but blames the jail for denying her medication. The cases are pending.
SHOWDOWN, FIRINGS, DEATH
The Savannah caregivers who protested to Corizon declined to discuss events in the jail, but Riner spoke to Reuters about her career. “These people need you. They're forgotten,” she said. She had a master’s degree, a decade’s experience, and credentials as an “advanced practice nurse.”
Soon after starting, she described feeling pressure to avoid hospitalizing sick inmates and instead treat them in the jail’s infirmary. At orientation in 2014, she testified, Corizon regional medical director Scott Kennedy told her, “It costs too much money to send people out.” She added, “They would ask me not to prescribe medications that I felt like were necessary.”
Kennedy acknowledged in testimony in the Loflin case that Corizon preferred inmates remain at the jail to control costs. But he added, “If someone needs to be in the hospital, I want them to be there, and I don't care what it costs.” Kennedy did not respond to interview requests.
The nursing director at the time lacked the credentials required by state law to oversee registered nurses, according to court records and medical staff. Inmate screenings and distribution of meds were often handled by nursing assistants, not nurses as required by state law, said former Corizon workers. Corizon declined to discuss the credentials of specific staff.
The breakdowns rattled Dr. Pugh and Nurse Riner. Riner turned to jail administrator Thomas Gilberg, vowing to resign. “The medical isn’t up to standards,” she said, according to Gilberg. He relayed her concerns to Sheriff St. Lawrence. That month, August 2014, St. Lawrence nominated Corizon’s top jail manager for a Medical Association of Georgia award.
On August 26, Pugh, Riner and another senior nurse, Lynne Williams, met the sheriff. They accused Corizon of “corruption” and “unethical practices,” according to notes taken by Chief Deputy Roy Harris and reviewed by Reuters. They said another inmate’s suicide on Easter Sunday might have been prevented. Pugh said Corizon “pushed some things under (the) rug” to secure the Medical Association of Georgia accreditation, according to Harris’s notes and testimony by the jail's Compliance Manager, Melissa Kohne, who also attended the meeting.
“Corizon said, ‘this is Pugh wanting to stir up trouble,’” Harris told Reuters.
Three weeks later, Riner was fired “for going outside the chain of command” by complaining to the sheriff, an internal jail memo said. Pugh was fired for allegedly failing to work scheduled hours, which he denied. Williams was fired, also for allegedly going outside the chain of command.
The day Pugh was let go, September 24, 2014, was the last day Donald Johnson received the regular blood pressure checks for his hypertension.
Johnson, 68, arrested a month earlier on Medicaid fraud charges, had a history of chronic hypertension and diabetes. Pugh checked him on September 16 and ordered his blood pressure to be monitored three times weekly. His last blood pressure check came eight days later, records show.
On November 13 at 5:31 p.m., a deputy found Johnson in distress. A nurse couldn’t find a pulse, and he was pronounced dead at the hospital. Official cause: hardening and narrowing of coronary arteries, often linked to high blood pressure. He was never convicted of the charges.
“It's not a day that goes by that I don't think about how he may have suffered,” his daughter, Rochon Johnson Small, said in an interview.
A family lawsuit alleged the company was deliberately indifferent to Johnson’s serious medical needs, but the case was dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired. “This case went to court and was dismissed without finding of liability for Corizon,” the company said.
'I WANT TO DIE'
On New Year’s 2015, Matthew Ajibade arrived on charges of battery and resisting arrest. Police told jail deputies Ajibade was a “49,” code for a mentally disturbed person. An arresting officer wanted to take him to a hospital for a mental health check, but was overruled by a supervisor.
Ajibade, 21, attended Savannah College of Art and Design. Three years earlier, he had suffered a mental breakdown in Los Angeles, when police found him in the middle of a road. He took medication for bipolar disorder.
Booked four hours after his arrest, Ajibade refused to return to his cell. Three deputies wrestled him to the ground, and a sergeant attempted to shock him with a Taser. Ajibade grabbed it and tried to stun the deputies, toppling the sergeant. Deputies punched and kicked Ajibade, then cuffed his hands behind his back, shackled his legs and carried him to a cell where they put him in a restraint chair and covered his head in a spit mask.
“I want to die!” Ajibade yelled, kicking and squirming.
Deputy Jason Kenny pressed a Taser against Ajibade’s thigh and squeezed the trigger. Ajibade screamed. “Stop kicking. You’re going to get it again,” the deputy said. He stunned him twice more, Kenny later testified.
When he stopped, Ajibade’s skin was “hot to the touch,” said Kenny.
A deputy called Corizon nurse Gregory Brown, on the job less than two weeks, at 11:47 p.m. Brown was out of the cell in 51 seconds, jail records show. Brown later testified he wasn’t trained on how to check inmates in a restraint chair. He didn’t assess Ajibade’s respiration, blood pressure, pulse or airway. He said he didn’t know Ajibade had been punched, kicked or stunned with a Taser.
For 100 minutes, no one checked on Ajibade. When senior officer Maxine Evans looked in his cell at 1:30 a.m., he was dead.
The jail's policy requires checks every 15 minutes for inmates in restraint chairs. An internal jail investigation found that Evans’ “restraint log” – signed by Brown – was falsified to show multiple checks before 1:30 a.m.
A jury convicted Kenny of cruelty to an inmate, Evans of perjury and public records fraud, and Brown of making a false statement. Involuntary manslaughter charges were dismissed against all. Kenny got a one-month sentence, Evans probation and Brown a three-year suspended sentence. Each declined to comment.
BEGGING FOR CARE
After Ajibade’s death, jail Compliance Manager Kohne begged the county to end Corizon’s contract.
“I’m scared to death somebody is going to die over something stupid that Corizon is going to do,” she told the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in an April 2016 interview. Jail officials, she said, had become “skeptical” of Corizon after it dismissed the doctor and two nurses. Kohne did not respond to interview requests.
Ajibade’s death prompted an audit by the Medical Association of Georgia, which found information missing from files, breakdowns in inmate screening, and misuse of restraint chairs. A lawsuit by Ajibade’s family was settled.
The accrediting agency put the jail on probation for about nine months, and Chatham County hired experts to inspect the jail and Corizon’s contract. On August 4, 2015, a monitor warned the sheriff that jail healthcare “wasn't at even constitutional levels,” Kohne testified. Monitor RJS Justice Services did not respond to requests for comment.
Nine months later, Jimmie Lee Alexander, 60, jailed for missing a court date and receiving stolen property, complained to guards about throbbing pain in his right knee and hip. He asked to go to the hospital.
A nurse prescribed a painkiller. Later that night, Alexander crawled to the middle of his wing’s floor, vomited and pleaded again for help. The nurse phoned Corizon’s medical director, Guy Augustin, who recommended keeping the inmate under close watch at the jail, records show.
The next day, Augustin did not check Alexander until 2:45 p.m. Concerned by the coldness of Alexander’s right leg, Augustin ordered him to the hospital with deputies, not an ambulance. It took more than an hour to arrange his ride and another hour to reach the ER. Doctors removed a massive blood clot that choked off Alexander’s thigh. Early the next morning, Alexander suffered a heart attack and died. He was unconvicted of his charges. A family lawsuit described his leg as gangrenous.
A judge dismissed the lawsuit against the sheriff, nurses and Corizon but ruled the ongoing case could proceed against Augustin and two jailers, who all deny wrongdoing. In court filings, Corizon and the doctor said they “met or exceeded” standards of care. Augustin declined comment.
Two months after Alexander’s death, Corizon’s contract ended. At midnight July 31, 2016, the keys to the infirmary were passed to another contractor. Sheriff John Wilcher, who took over that March, said his “first goal” was to change healthcare contractors. “They just weren't the type of medical people I wanted here,” he told Reuters.
Corizon’s troubles didn’t end there. Alameda County, California, one of the nation’s biggest jail systems, dropped Corizon later that year. Seven months later, the company lost its contract in Indiana’s prison system.
The company went through a series of shake-ups: a new chief executive officer in 2015, a new chief financial officer in 2016, a recapitalization under new investors and another new CEO in 2017, and a deal to eliminate more than $100 million in debt in 2018.
In November 2018, Corizon agreed to pay $3.7 million to settle the case of a man whose family claimed he died from inadequate medical care while detoxing from opioids in a Colorado jail. A month later, it was ordered to pay $10 million in a lawsuit over the death of a female inmate detoxing from heroin in Oregon.
Then Corizon lost a $189 million contract with Arizona’s state prison system.
Contracts often “move around the industry,” said Hyman, who became CEO in 2019. “We got beat in competition and that was my competitors across the street,” he said. “They underbid us.” Corizon stresses quality care, he said. “You make more money if they are healthy. If they get sick,” he said, “you're going to have a problem with the contract.”
One inmate in Corizon’s care was Wade Jones, 40, a businessman accused of stealing golf balls, food and alcohol at a store in Walker, Michigan, in April 2018. A judge sentenced Jones to five days in jail for retail theft, a misdemeanor, at the Kent County Correctional Facility.
That night, a deputy twice alerted Corizon medical staff that Jones was showing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, jail records show. The next day, he complained of tremors, anxiety and nausea. Surveillance video showed Jones picking at his skin, pacing and beating the walls, according to a wrongful death lawsuit his family filed.
The next morning, he was sent to the infirmary at 6 a.m. and placed in an observation cell. By 7:30 a.m., he had passed out on a toilet. When a nurse checked on him eight minutes later, he was unresponsive.
Corizon staff began chest compressions and tried to administer oxygen, but the tank was empty or broken, the lawsuit said. Surveillance video showed a Corizon nurse struggling to operate a defibrillator on Jones, the family said in its lawsuit. The battery was low and it powered off without delivering a shock, the suit said. Jones went into cardiac arrest and then a coma, dying on May 2. While in jail, he never saw a doctor, jail logs show.
Corizon called the allegations “absolutely, categorically false” and said it plans “to vigorously defend this case.”

This year, holding company the Flacks Group acquired Corizon, keeping Hyman on as CEO. He said the sale moved Corizon from the world of private equity ownership where stakeholders have “to constantly get money from investors” to one where the focus is to “think long term.”

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Negotiations between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan over a controversial multi-billion dollar dam on the Blue Nile will resume on Tuesday, nearly two months after Egypt left the talks, African Union chairman Cyril Ramaphosa said on Monday.
A bitter dispute between the three countries over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) remains unresolved even after the reservoir behind the dam began filling in July.
""The resumption of the trilateral negotiations on the GERD ... is a reaffirmation of the confidence that the parties have in an African-led negotiations process,"" Ramaphosa, who is South Africa's president, said in a statement. 
The resumption of talks comes two days after Ethiopia summoned the U.S. ambassador over what it called an ""incitement of war"" between Ethiopia and Egypt by U.S. President Donald Trump over the dam dispute.
Trump called on Friday for an agreement between the countries, but said it was a dangerous situation and that Cairo could end up ""blowing up that dam"". 
Sudan's Irrigation Ministry said talks on Tuesday would discuss a new model for talks giving ""a bigger role to experts and observers"". 
""Then the new negotiation methods will be put to the heads of state to decide on them and resume negotiations on the basis of a precise timetable,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
Egypt, which gets more than 90% of its scarce fresh water from the Nile and fears the dam could devastate its economy, left the negotiations in August after Ethiopia proposed a new timeline for filling the GERD. 
Trump also said Ethiopia had broken a U.S.-brokered agreement to resolve the dispute, forcing him to cut funds. The United States cut $100 million in aid to Ethiopia in September.
Ethiopian lawmakers said on Monday that ""no force on earth"" would stop the completion of the dam and that they were ready to defend it from internal as well as external attacks.
""We will defend any possible internal and external attacks and conspiracies and we shall complete the dam,"" the lawmakers from the lower House said in a statement.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Monday of violating a new U.S.-brokered ceasefire in fighting over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, casting doubt over the prospects of the latest international push to end a month of clashes.
Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said in a televised address that he wanted to resolve the conflict ""by political and military means"" and reiterated a demand that ethnic Armenian forces must agree to leave the region for fighting to stop.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan wrote earlier on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that the Armenian side ""continued to adhere to the ceasefire.""
The latest fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, erupted on Sept. 27 and is the worst in the South Caucasus since the 1990s. Hundreds have been killed and two Russian-brokered ceasefires have failed to hold.
World powers want to prevent a wider war that might draw in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia. The conflict has also strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies.
A third ceasefire since Oct. 10 was agreed on Sunday after separate talks in Washington between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan. nL1N2HG0R0
Within minutes of its coming into force at 8 a.m. local time (0400 GMT), Azerbaijan's defence ministry said in a statement that Armenian forces had shelled villages in the Terter and Lachin regions, located at opposite ends of the conflict zone.
Authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh denied this: the defence ministry said Azeri forces fired missiles on Armenian positions on the northeastern side on the line of contact and the foreign ministry said Azeri warplanes had violated the ceasefire.
Armenia's defence ministry said in a statement that the Azeri side violated the truce at around 9.10 a.m. local time.
Pompeo has since left Washington, landing on Monday in India on the first leg of a five-day Asian trip. 
Armenians regard Nagorno-Karabakh as part of their historic homeland; Azeris consider it illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control. About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over the enclave.
Aliyev, in his address, criticised the OSCE Minsk Group that was formed to mediate the conflict. The group, led by France, Russia and the United States, participated in Sunday's talks and its co-chairs have agreed to meet again with the two foreign ministers in Geneva on Oct. 29.

""For almost 30 years, the Minsk Group co-chairs have tried to reconcile Azerbaijan with the process of freezing the conflict, but we have created a new reality,"" Aliyev said. ""We are fed up with these negotiations. How long can you negotiate?""

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>","Climate activists abseil from bridges, halt Frankfurt rush-hour traffic","BERLIN (Reuters) - Climate activists abseiled from bridges near Germany's financial hub Frankfurt on Monday in protest at the planned expansion of a motorway, causing backed-up traffic on busy roads during the morning rush hour.
The activists called for a stop to the clearing of part of the Dannenroeder forest, which they refer to as ""Danni"", to make way for a highway.
The felling of trees in the forest, which lies in a nature protection area north of Frankfurt, started this month and police removed activists from tree houses they had built in protest.
At a bridge crossing the A5 motorway on Monday, masked activists hung from ropes, holding a banner saying: ""No planes. No cars"". 
Police and rescue teams were working to bring the protesters down from the bridges. The motorways affected were the A3, the A5 and the A661, all busy commuter routes around Frankfurt. 
""Since 7 o'clock this morning, traffic on these three motorways in both directions has been partially halted, causing traffic jams as long as 10 kilometres (6.2 miles),"" a police spokesman said.
""Cars and motorways are yesterday's technology, which causes countless casualties through accidents and climate change,"" Extinction Rebellion Germany said on Twitter, urging politicians to make transport policies more climate friendly.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 06:56AM ET</span>",China to impose sanctions on U.S. firms over Taiwan arms sales,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will impose sanctions on  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT), Boeing Defense (N:BA), Raytheon (N:RTX) and other U.S. companies it says are involved in Washington's arms sales to Taiwan, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday.
Zhao Lijian told journalists that China was acting to protect its national interest, but did not spell out what form the sanctions would take.
The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion, the Pentagon said last week.
Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to bring under control, by force if necessary.
""To safeguard our national interests, China decided to take necessary measures and levy sanctions on U.S. companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defence, and Raytheon, and those individuals and companies who behaved badly in the process of the arms sales,"" Zhao said.
China has imposed sanctions on Lockheed Martin and other U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form the penalties have taken.
The United States, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan through arms sales and visits by senior U.S officials, adding to tensions in relations between Beijing and Washington, already strained by disagreements over the South China Sea, Hong Kong, human rights and trade. 
A spokesman for Boeing said in an emailed statement that the company's partnership with China's aviation community had long-term benefits and that Boeing remained committed to it.
Lockheed Martin said in an emailed statement that all of its international military sales are strictly regulated by the U.S. government, and that its presence in China is limited. 

Raytheon did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.
