Backed by musicians from the Paris Symphony Orchestra, the dancers performed their impromptu 20-minute rendition before hundreds of onlookers. Behind them were banners reading ""Culture in danger."" 
Paris Opera dancers have a bespoke pension plan dating back to the 17th century. It includes the right to retire on a full pension at the age of 42, two decades earlier than the average worker. 
They stand to lose those benefits if Macron pushes ahead with a planned overhaul of a convoluted pension system that he says will be fairer, incentives workers to stay in the labor force until 64 and balance the pension budget.
""We start classical dance at the age of 8. By our late teenage years, we're getting recurring injuries,"" said ballerina Heloise Jocqueviel. ""Once you reach the age of 42, you're already suffering from arthritis, stress fractures, hernias and in some cases titanium hips. 
""It's hard to maintain a level of excellence until 42, but 64 seems impossible.""
The dancers have been on strike alongside other public sector workers, including performers from the state-run Comedie Francaise, since Dec. 5. Dozens of shows have been canceled.
The strikes have caused travel chaos, forced schools to close and prompted refinery shut downs. Macron and his government refuse to back down but will resume negotiations with trade unions in early January.
The Paris Opera house said it had lost nearly 8 million euros in ticket sales.

""It's important to defend the quality of the Paris Opera,"" said Jacques Peigne, the father of one opera house ballerina. ""It's obvious they are not able to dance any older than 42.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Ousted Bolivian leader Evo Morales told Reuters he plans to return to his home country by next Christmas, after going into exile in neighboring Argentina following a disputed election.
In an interview in Buenos Aires, where Morales found refuge after a highly-contested bid for a fourth term in October, the South American socialist icon said he is helping his party prepare for an upcoming special election.
Members of his Movement for Socialism (MAS) coalition will get together in Buenos Aires on Sunday to start choosing their candidates. Asked about his own plans, and whether he would return to Bolivia by this time next year, Morales said there was no doubt about it: ""I'll be back.""
""For reasons of security I can't go into detail about the plan we have for returning to Bolivia. But one has to go back to one's country,"" he said.
He said he was sure his coalition would win back the presidency. Morales' victory in the October election was annulled because of irregularities detected by international auditors. The scandal sparked deadly riots and forced Morales to resign and leave Bolivia in mid-November. 
He denies any wrongdoing and said his only regret was not having early intelligence about the what he calls the coup that ousted him. ""We were surprised due to lack of information,"" he said.
""I'm very sorry that neither the intelligence of the Bolivian police nor the armed forces warned us that there was a coup on the way,"" Morales added.
Lawmakers have appointed an electoral tribunal expected to set a date by Jan. 2 for new elections within 120 days. 
Prosecutors have meanwhile issued an arrest warrant against Morales for sedition, terrorism and terrorist financing, promoted by the government of interim President Jeanine Anez, a former senator and opponent of Morales.

Morales has ruled out running as a candidate himself and has named Luis Arce Catacora, his former economy minister, and Andronico Rodriguez, a key coca farmer union boss, as potential MAS presidential candidates.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament approved on Tuesday a new electoral law, a key demand of protesters to make elections fairer, but political deadlock is still holding up the selection of an interim prime minister, threatening renewed unrest. 
Mass protests have gripped Iraq since Oct. 1 and protesters, most of them young, are demanding an overhaul of a political system they see as profoundly corrupt and keeping most Iraqis in poverty. More than 450 people have been killed.
""In the name of Iraq, and in the name of the Iraqi people, in the name of the martyrs, in the name of all those who sacrificed, in the name of the displaced, the law has been approved,"" Council of Representatives Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi said after the vote.
The new election law passed by parliament will allow voters to elect individual lawmakers instead of choosing from party lists, and have each member of parliament represent a specific electoral district instead of groups of legislators representing entire provinces.
""This decision is the decision of the people; the people who were patient here in Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ). They made their decision known, which is for elections to be individual 100 percent,"" said protester Dawood Salman, 58, speaking from the central Baghdad square that has become the uprising's epicentre.
Protesters have demanded not just a new electoral law, but also the removal of the entire ruling elite seen as enriching itself off the state and serving foreign powers — above all Iran — as many Iraqis languish in poverty without jobs, healthcare or education, and an independent premier with no party affiliation.
""Hopefully this is a sign of things to come, this is the first step towards meeting our demands. We now want the actualisation of the other demands: to have a president, prime minister, and speaker who all do not belong to any party,"" said protester Hashim Mohammed.
'ROCK BOTTOM'
Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion, power has been shared along ethno-sectarian lines among parties from Iraq's largest three communities.
The most powerful post, that of prime minister is held by a Shi'ite Arab, the speaker of parliament by a Sunni Arab and the presidency by a Kurd.
""We call on all politicians who came after 2003 to leave government and hand over power. All politicians with loyalties to Iran or to Gulf countries need to go. We need a true Iraqi, someone honest and honourable,"" said Mohammed. ""They dragged Iraq into rock bottom, those traitors who came after 2003.""
Infighting between political parties who are clinging on to power has fuelled the crisis and threatens to cause more unrest as protesters lose patience with a deadlock in parliament that is holding up the selection of an interim prime minister.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned last month under pressure from the street demonstrations, but has remained in office in a caretaker capacity. The constitutional deadline to name a replacement expired on Thursday.
Two blocs of political parties, one backed by Iran and the other populist and anti-Iranian, are closely involved in backroom deals to agree on a candidate.

Any agreement on thorny political issues looks unlikely. The protests have shaken the country out of two years of relative calm following the defeat of Islamic State insurgents.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 12:07PM ET</span>",Family members of man killed during Iran protests arrested: Mehr news agency,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Iranian authorities have arrested relatives of a young man who was shot dead during demonstrations last month, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported on Tuesday, citing an informed source.
The Mehr report did not specify which of Pouya Bakhtiari's family members had been arrested but Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of New York-based advocacy group the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) said they included his parents, citing information from activists who had visited the family on Monday.
The Ministry of Intelligence and judiciary offices in Karaj, a town west of Tehran, had each summoned Bakhtiari's father, Manouchehr, twice for questioning in the past week, a report posted on CHRI's website on Tuesday said.
They asked him to call off a commemoration ceremony in the town of Karaj, west of Tehran, on Dec. 26 -- the 40th day after his son's death, as often observed by Shi'ite Muslims, Iran's religious majority -- citing concerns it could create unrest.
Manouchehr, who in an Instagram post last week had invited local and foreign media to attend the commemoration ceremony, refused to cancel it, he told CHRI.
CHRI says the 27-year-old Bakhtiari ""died of a bullet wound to the head"" in Karaj on Nov. 16.
Mehr noted that Bakhtiari had been ""killed in a suspicious way"" during the recent unrest.
Its report cited an informed source as saying the arrests were ""to maintain order and security of the honorable people who have faced damages, and with the intent of preventing ... the repeat of armed action against the people"".
Security forces have been on high alert for any events that could spark further unrest after protests against a hike in fuel prices which turned political last month, sparking the bloodiest crackdown in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic.
About 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest that started on Nov. 15, three Iranian interior ministry officials told Reuters according to a report published on Monday.
That figure is much higher than estimated by international human rights groups and was dismissed as ""fake news"" by a spokesman for Iran's Supreme National Security Council, according to semi-official news agency Tasnim.
Some family members of people killed for political or other reasons unrelated to the protests last month have also said Dec. 26 should be a day of commemoration, according to CHRI."

""There might be a need for an authorization in line with the developments over there. The parliament is conducting work on this issue,"" Kalin told a news conference in Ankara.
""We will continue to support the internationally recognized Libyan government. This support may be in terms of military training, or other areas, such as political support,"" Kalin said.
Turkey backs Libya's internationally recognized government and has said it could deploy troops there if it receives such a request. Libya's Tripoli-based government has been fighting off a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces based in the
east of the country. Haftar's Libyan National Army has received support from Russia, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
Speaking in Ankara after a cabinet meeting, Kalin added that Turkey would continue to provide the necessary support to Fayez al-Serraj's Tripoli-based government. Turkey has already sent military supplies to the Serraj's government despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month.
Ankara says Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) has not yet asked Turkey to deploy troops to Libya. However, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that Turkey would increase its military support to Libya if necessary and would evaluate ground, air and marine options.
Last week, Russia said it was very concerned about Turkey's potential troop deployment in Libya, adding that the military accord between the two countries raised questions. A Turkish delegation traveled to Moscow on Monday to discuss developments in Libya and Syria.

Suchanee Cloitre, who was working for Voice TV at the time, was convicted for a post she made about a legal dispute over working conditions at the Thammakaset farm, lawyer Woraporn Uthairangsee said.
""I'm shocked and did not think the sentence would be so harsh,"" Suchanee told Reuters after the sentencing. She said she was worried about what would happen to her 8-month-old son.
Her Twitter post centered on complaint that a group of migrant workers from Myanmar made to Thailand's National Human Rights Commission about conditions at Thammakaset in 2016.

Thammakaset, which denied the accusations from the outset, has also filed lawsuits against 20 journalists and activists over the case.
Representatives of Thammakaset could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.
Suchanee, 30, said she would appeal and is currently out on bail."

The BDP of President Mokgweetsi Masisi won the election in October with 38 seats - automatically making their candidate president - while the opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) got 15 seats, and two smaller parties got four between them.
October's election was the first time there had been any doubt about whether the long-ruling BDP would return to power, after a spat between Masisi and former President Ian Khama, who backed his rival, seemed to throw the contest open.
""On the face of the petitions, it cannot be deduced that the people or institutions which allegedly committed the corrupt and illegal practices are election or polling agents,"" Justice Mercy Garekwe said. ""The petitions are therefore a nullity.""
The ruling party has been in power since independence from Britain in 1966, and the country has enjoyed stability and prosperity thanks to its plentiful and well-managed diamond resources.
But its over-reliance on those same diamonds and high unemployment are now major policy challenges for its leaders.
At his swearing-in last month, Masisi promised to drive a transformation of Botswana's economy that would create more jobs for its 2.2 million people and diversify the economy away from minerals."

A court in the southern African nation last month sentenced the couple under the country's harsh colonial-era sodomy law.
Ambassador Daniel Foote said he was ""personally horrified,"" adding: ""meanwhile, government officials can steal millions of public dollars without prosecution, political cadres can beat innocent citizens ... with no consequences, poachers can kill numerous elephants... and face a maximum of only five years.""
A furious President Edgar Lungu said publicly that he had complained to his American counterpart Donald Trump over the ambassador's comments. Embassy sources on Monday said Foote had been recalled. The embassy declined to give official comment.
""The dos and don'ts for those who represent nations in other nations are very clear. So if one crosses the line, it's not about bilateral relations between the two countries,"" Home Affairs Stephen Kampyongo told Hot FM radio.
""They (Washington) listened to the complaint,"" he said.
An embassy source on Monday told Reuters that Washington had decided to recall its ambassador because it was difficult for him to work in Zambia if his hosts did not want him.
Over the past decade, several African countries have come into conflict over LGBT rights with Western countries, many of which are paying a lot of their bills. The previous U.S. Obama administration cut aid to Uganda and Malawi over homophobic laws and policies, although Western condemnation sometimes provokes African leaders into taking more hardline positions.
Uganda announced plans in October for a bill that would impose the death penalty for gay sex, but it later backtracked after major aid donors said they were monitoring the situation.
Zambia receives hundreds of millions of dollars every year in financial support from the United States, some of which goes toward fighting HIV/AIDS."

Tito Magoti, a lawyer with the Dar es Salaam-based Legal and Human Right Center (LHRC) and Theodory Giyan, an IT expert at a private company, were both charged with ""leading organized crime, possession of a computer program designed for the purpose of committing an offence and money laundering"", according to court documents seen by Reuters.
Police arrested Magoti with three other people they did not name on Friday on ""various allegations"".
Police announced Magoti was in their custody hours after the rights group that employs him said he was snatched off the street by men in civilian clothes.
The two men were not allowed to enter a plea after the charges were read against them at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
There was no immediate comment from the men's employers.
Money laundering is not a bailable offence in Tanzania.
This year rights groups and even the country's chief justice have called for the government to review laws that deny bail to criminal suspects for some offences.
Since President John Magufuli was elected in late 2015, Tanzania has tightened control of the media and civil society, shutting some newspapers, arresting opposition leaders and restricting political rallies.
Magufuli's government denies restricting media freedom and cracking down on democracy and human rights.
Prominent investigative journalist Erick Kabendera was charged with similar economic crimes in August and remains in detention, while another journalist, Azory Gwanda, went missing in late 2017."

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Thousands of Algerian students protested on Tuesday, pressing their demands for wholesale change despite calls for a pause in their rallies after the sudden death of the country's powerful army chief. 
They chanted ""No dialogue"", rejecting the new president's offer of talks, and said they would continue protests that brought millions onto the streets early this year and tens of thousands in recent months. 
The military chief of staff, lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah, died of a heart attack on Monday, throwing Africa's largest country, a major energy exporter, into further uncertainty 10 months into its political crisis. 
The opposition protests, held each Tuesday and Friday since February, seek to bring down the ruling elite, push the military from its decades-old place as kingmaker in national politics and end corruption. The demonstrations have been peaceful, and the authorities have not responded with force. 
""A civilian state not a military state"" the protesters chanted at the rally on Tuesday. 
However, Gaed Salah's death, at a key moment in the crisis after this month's disputed presidential election, had prompted debate among many protesters over whether they should press on with their weekly march or postpone it. 
His funeral was originally planned for Tuesday, but has been put off to Wednesday. Though protesters demand the army's withdrawal from politics, some had also applauded his mostly peaceful handling of their marches. 
With no formal leadership or organization, the protest movement has demonstrated stamina in maintaining street pressure for more than 40 consecutive weeks, though it has sometimes struggled to respond nimbly to unfolding events. 
In April, it scored its greatest success when Gaed Salah went on state television to urge his former ally, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, to step down after 20 years.
Last week, the new president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, was inaugurated following an election that the army had pushed for, but which the opposition had denounced as illegitimate so long as the old guard of rulers still held sway. 
He immediately offered dialogue with the protesters, but though some urged the movement to accept his proposal, others denounced it and rejected Tebboune's legitimacy as president. 
""The vote was not fair and dialogue cannot be fair,"" said Amari Farouk, a 20-year-old student at the protest. 
Gaed Salah's death now creates a new moment of decision for the opposition, as the protesters wait to see whether the Pouvoir -- or ""power"", as Algerians describe their secretive leaders -- will change its strategy.
So far, the state has allowed the protests to continue, hoping to wear the demonstrators out while throwing them some concessions, including the arrest on corruption charges of Bouteflika's allies.

12,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 10:01AM ET</span>",Russian-backed Syrian forces close in on major city in rebel-held Idlib,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russian-backed Syrian troops have encircled a Turkish observation post as they approach the city of Maarat al-Numan in an offensive into the last significant rebel pocket of Syria, sources on both sides said on Tuesday.
It is the first major bout of fighting since the leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran agreed in Ankara in September to ""de-escalate"" conflict in the northwestern province of Idlib after a months-long campaign that forced at least 500,000 civilians to flee. With diplomacy on a Syria peace settlement stalled, the de-escalation deal has been unraveling of late.
Insurgents controlling the Idlib region, which borders Turkey, include the powerful Islamist militant group Tahrir al-Sham as well as Turkish-backed rebel factions.
The sources said the Turkish military outpost, near the village of Surman and the main rebel-held highway that extends to the northern, government-controlled city of Aleppo, and eventually the capital Damascus further south, was now surrounded by Syrian forces, aided by Iranian-backed militias.
Turkey has 12 outposts in Idlib under a security arrangement struck with Russia and Iran, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's major allies, in 2017. There have been several shooting attacks on the outposts since then, prompting Turkish retaliation, but Russian pressure on Damascus halted firing by Assad's forces.
FRESH HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
As government forces have thrust into the southeast of Idlib over the past two weeks, thousands of people have fled Maarat al-Numan, a major city that has been a refuge for families who fled other areas of Syria recaptured by Damascus earlier in an 8-1/2-year-old civil war.
A Russian-led aerial bombing campaign has helped Syrian government forces close in on the strategic city, a major factor in the flight of civilians further north closer to the border with Turkey.
The offensive has killed scores of civilians and sparked so far an exodus of at least 80,000 people in all of Idlib province, including 30,000 in the past week alone, the United Nations said on Monday.
Eight people, including five children, died when bombs dropped by Russian jets struck displaced families as they were seeking shelter in the village of Jubas, east of the town of Saraqeb, rescuers and area residents said.
""The bombing killed two families who had set up tents,"" said Mohammad Rasheed, a local rights activist.
At least 12 other people were killed this week when Russian and Syrian air force jets hit civilian convoys on main roads where families were fleeing near the Turkish frontier, according to humanitarian groups and witnesses.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday he was ""alarmed by the scale of the military operation and reported attacks on evacuation routes"" used by civilians fleeing north towards the Turkish border.
""The Secretary-General reminds all parties of their obligations to protect civilians and ensure freedom of movement,"" Guterres's spokesman said, urging an immediate cessation of hostilities.
Moscow and Damascus both deny allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and say they are fighting al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants.
Syrian government forces are now some six km (four miles) east of Maarat al-Numan, according to Hajj Abu Rasheed from the National Liberation Front, a rebel coalition backed by Turkey.
He said a suicide bomber blew himself up at an army outpost in Jerganaz that had been captured on Monday by Iranian-backed militias and government troops in their advance."

There were no more details on where they had gone. But dozens of Eritrean athletes have refused to return home or disappeared while competing abroad over the past decade, often in a bid to claim asylum.
Thousands of Eritreans flee their small Horn of Africa country every year, citing political repression and lengthy military conscription.
The seven players appeared to have got round tight security at the hotel where they were staying on Monday evening, said Rogers Mulindwa, spokesman for the regional soccer association CECAFA that was running the tournament.
There was no immediate comment from the Eritrean government. The rest of the team returned home after losing 3-0 to Uganda in the final of the CECAFA Senior Challenge Cup.
In October, five Eritrean players disappeared from their hotel during another CECAFA tournament in Uganda.
In 2012, 14 members of the Eritrea soccer squad disappeared, again while playing in a CECAFA tournament in Uganda.
Eritrea has been ruled by President Isaias Afwerki since its independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Its population is around five million, and the United Nations estimated in late 2018 that a further 500,000 Eritreans were refugees."

Mexico on Monday accused Bolivia of intimidating its diplomats in La Paz after a chill in relations since Lopez Obrador decided last month to give political asylum to former Bolivian president Evo Morales, a fellow leftist.
Bolivia's government responded by saying Mexico had hijacked a regional summit, and had dragged its feet in recognizing its new, conservative premier.
Mexico's foreign ministry said there was ""excessive"" surveillance of the Mexican ambassador's residence and Mexican embassy in Bolivia by about 150 Bolivian intelligence and security service personnel.
During a regular government news briefing, Lopez Obrador declined to comment on what had motivated Bolivia to act as his government alleged, but said things were improving.
""I have news that this situation of extreme surveillance on our embassy in Bolivia has eased considerably,"" he said.
Lopez Obrador did not elaborate, but said ""many things"" still needed to be cleared up.
Bolivia has moved to the right since Morales resigned in November after a presidential election that the Organization of American States said was rigged in his favor.
Bolivia is currently governed by interim President Jeanine Añez, a former conservative senator and opponent of Morales. 

Lopez Obrador said Mexico was eager to know if new elections would be held in Bolivia and whether all ""political forces"" would be able to take part in them.

At about 9 p.m., the police used the gas to disperse protesters outside the Peninsula Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui after making an arrest. Officers also clashed with protesters inside shopping malls, used pepper spray and made a few arrests. Hundreds of demonstrators, many wearing masks, turned up at multiple locations including Mong Kok, Causeway Bay and Yuen Long.
Hong Kong has endured more than six months of clashes between protesters and police, ignited by a proposed extradition law to allow fugitives to be sent to China to stand trial.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Indian authorities stepped up security and shut down the internet in various places on Tuesday while members of the ruling party planned marches backing a new citizenship law even though nationwide protests against it are escalating.
An interior ministry official said the government expected all state security officials to be on duty on Christmas Eve and through the holiday week.
""We want the police to prevent an outbreak of violence but we also realize that the situation can get out of control, hence paramilitary forces will be deployed in markets and public spaces,"" said a senior security official in New Delhi. 
At least 20 rallies in support or against the new law were scheduled in different cities with protesters from both sides canvassing on social media to get people out over Christmas and the New Year.
The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) aims to fast-track citizenship for persecuted Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians who arrived in India before Dec. 31, 2014, from Muslim-majority Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Its passing on Dec. 11 triggered demonstrations in the eastern state of Assam, where protesters fear it will make illegal migrants from Bangladesh legal residents.
Elsewhere, critics say the law discriminates against Muslims and is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda. The government denies that.
Activists opposed to the law said they were trying to keep up the momentum and were looking for ways to work around the police clampdown and internet blackouts.
Senior members of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leading rallies to support the law said they were determined to counter what they see as misleading criticism of it.
""We want to explain that the law is not anti-Muslim and we want to expose that those who are leading the protests against the law are misleading innocent, uneducated Muslims,"" said BJP spokesman Gopal Krishna Agarwal.
At least 21 people have been killed since the law was passed in protests that represent the first major opposition to Modi's legislative agenda since his party's landslide re-election this year.
Police in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), which has seen the most deaths in the protests, suggested that Islamists were stirring up the anti-CAA demonstrations.
""We have proof that an Islamic group with its headquarters in Delhi and its strongest base in the southern state in Kerala is behind the violence in the UP,"" said senior police officer Kalanidhi Naithani.
In the last 10 days, police in UP have taken nearly 900 people into custody for violence, said an official in the state's police control room. More than 2,000 people have been arrested across India.
'EXCESSIVE FORCE'
New York-based Human Rights Watch criticized the police action and called on them to stop using unnecessary lethal force against demonstrators. 
The rights group said police had only used excessive force only against those protesting against the law, including many students.
""The authorities should prosecute violent protesters, but they also need to hold police officers to account for using excessive force,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, the group's South Asia director.
In Uttar Pradesh's capital of Lucknow, Tabassum Raza, a 26-year-old Muslim woman, said she was beaten by police who stormed into her home.

""When I told them there was no one in they started beating me with batons and damaged everything,"" Raza said, showing bruised forearms and legs.

Israel had said on Sunday it would admit Christians from the Gaza Strip, a territory it keeps under blockade, reversing a Dec. 12 announcement that barred them on security grounds - a departure from its usual Christmas policy.
On Tuesday, Christmas Eve, Palestinian border officials said 316 permits had been issued for Christians to leave Gaza for Jerusalem and in Bethlehem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Church leaders said they had requested 800 such permits.
Gaza has around 1,000 Christians, most of them from the Greek Orthodox denomination who celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7, amid a mainly Muslim population of 2 million Palestinians.
""They issued permits for old people, not the young,"" said Haifa Assalfiti, 62, before she crossed the Erez border terminal into Israel en route to Bethlehem with her husband.
""My son, my daughter and my daughter-in-law didn't get permits. They are at home angry,"" she told Reuters.
A spokeswoman for Cogat, the Israeli liaison agency to the Palestinian territories, did not immediately return a call for comment.
Israel tightly restricts movements out of the Gaza Strip, a coastal territory controlled by Hamas Islamists who are deemed a terrorist group by Israel and Western powers.
Last year, ahead of Christmas Day on Dec. 25, Israel granted permits for close to 700 Gaza Christians to travel to Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth and other holy cities that draw thousands of pilgrims each holiday season."

CHENGDU, China/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe asked South Korea's president on Tuesday to take steps to resolve a bitter dispute at their first bilateral talks in 15 months, a sign that while the mood is improving, knotty problems between the U.S. allies remain. 
Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in stressed, at their meeting in China, the need to improve ties after the worst period of tension between their countries in decades.
Relations have been strained since South Korea's Supreme Court last year ordered Japanese firms to compensate some South Koreans forced to work for them during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule. Japan says the issue was settled under a 1965 treaty and that the court ruling violated international law.
""South Korea should take responsibility and come up with measures to resolve the issue,"" Abe told a news conference. ""I asked that South Korea initiate steps to restore ties between Japan and South Korea to a healthy state."" 
Moon and Abe met on the sidelines of a trilateral summit with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in the Chinese city of Chengdu, with tension over stalled denuclearization talks between North Korea and the United States the main issue. 
After the Korean court ruling, Japan imposed restrictions on the export to South Korea of high-tech materials used in the manufacture of chips, compounding their dispute which threatened to undermine security cooperation between them.
Abe and Moon agreed to meet more often despite differences over history and trade, Moon's spokeswoman, Ko Min-jung, told a briefing in Chengdu, adding they both wanted to resolve differences through dialogue.
Abe said close security cooperation with the United States was ""extremely important"" in dealing with North Korea.
The two leaders had ""candid"" discussions recognizing the importance of dialogue, though there were still ""substantive differences,"" said Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoki Okada. He said the mood was tense at times but not confrontational.
Moon expressed hopes for an early solution to their differences. 
""Japan and South Korea are historically and culturally the closest neighbors,"" Moon said. ""We're not in a relationship that can set the two apart even when there's some discomfort for a while."" 
The two shook hands and smiled slightly before their 45-minute meeting, longer than the planned 30 minutes.

South Korea last month made a last-minute decision to maintain an intelligence-sharing deal with Japan that is important for trilateral security cooperation with the United States.

Bolsonaro, 64, was given a brain scan at the hospital that detected no abnormalities, the president's office said on Monday shortly after the fall.

Khashoggi disappeared after going to the consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, to obtain documents for his planned wedding. His body was reportedly dismembered and removed from the building, and his remains have not been found.
On Monday, Saudi Arabia sentenced five people to death and three to jail over the murder, while dismissing charges against three others, finding them not guilty. A U.N. investigator accused Riyadh of making a ""mockery"" of justice by exonerating senior figures who may have ordered the killing.
The presiding Saudi court rejected the findings of a U.N. inquiry by ruling that the killing was not premeditated, rather carried out ""at the spur of the moment"". 
Turkey said on Monday the trial outcome fell far short of serving justice, and on Tuesday Turkish Communications Director Fahrettin Altun slammed the verdict as an ""insult to the intelligence of any fair observer"".
""The international media must pursue the case of Khashoggi until there is true accountability...Those responsible must face justice sooner or later,"" Altun said on Twitter.
""This despicable murder was done at a diplomatic facility against every diplomatic norm imaginable! We will follow this case to the end regardless (of) how high it goes.""
The murder of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and critic of the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, caused a global outcry, and some Western governments, as well as the CIA, said they believed the prince ordered the killing. 
Saudi officials say he had no role, though in September the crown prince indicated some personal accountability, saying ""it happened under my watch"".
After Monday's verdict, a source familiar with U.S. intelligence assessments said key U.S. government agencies rejected the validity of the court proceedings and CIA experts still believed Prince Mohammad personally ordered, or at least approved of, the killing.

The source said the five men condemned to death were essentially foot soldiers in the killing, while two senior security officials acquitted played a more significant role.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Philip, the 98-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth, was released from a London hospital on Tuesday and joined other members of the royal family for their Christmas celebrations.
Philip, whose official title is the Duke of Edinburgh, had been receiving treatment at the King Edward VII Hospital since Friday.
He walked out of the hospital on Tuesday morning, dressed in a dark suit, and shook hands with a nurse before getting into the front passenger seat of a car and being driven away.
The prince then traveled by helicopter to Sandringham estate in eastern England where the royal family traditionally gathers for Christmas.
""The Duke of Edinburgh has today left hospital after being discharged by his doctor and is now back at Sandringham. His Royal Highness would like to thank everyone who sent their good wishes,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement. 
Philip had been taken to hospital as a precautionary measure for treatment for a pre-existing condition, the palace said on Friday.
The 93-year-old queen traveled to Sandringham on Friday. 
It was not clear if Philip will accompany her to a Christmas Day church service on Wednesday, which he missed last year. 
Philip retired from public life in August 2017, although he has occasionally appeared at official engagements since.
He spent Christmas of 2011 in hospital after an operation to clear a blocked artery and he missed the end of celebrations to mark his wife's 60th year on the throne in 2012 after being hospitalized with a bladder infection.
In 2013, the Greek-born former naval officer underwent ""an exploratory operation following abdominal investigations.""
He was admitted to hospital in 2017 for treatment for an infection, also arising from a pre-existing condition, and last year spent 10 days in hospital for hip-replacement surgery.

In January this year, the prince was unhurt when his Land Rover flipped over after a collision with another car near Sandringham. He gave up his driving license after police gave him a warning for driving without wearing a seat belt.

The majority of attacks occurred overnight Saturday. One more occurred on an unoccupied Oxfam office on Tuesday morning, aid agencies said.
Among the agencies hit overnight on Saturday by rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) fired by unknown individuals were Oxfam and the International Rescue Committee (IRC).
The attacks on Saturday wounded one person, damaged property and caused 12 organizations to suspend aid programs in al-Dhalea, affecting 217,000 residents, United Nations aid chief Mark Lowcock said on Monday.
Oxfam said their office was hit by two RPGs, but nobody was injured. Tuesday's attack used an improvised explosive device (IED).
IRC said its office and a women's center were hit by RPGs on Saturday, injuring one security guard. ""Aid workers are not a target. Those who will suffer the most are innocent Yemenis who benefit from IRC's ... work,"" IRC said.
Yemen has suffered from almost five years of conflict since the Iran-aligned Houthi movement ousted President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government in late 2014. The coup drew military intervention in 2015 by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore Hadi's internationally recognized government.
The southwestern province of al-Dhalea lies on the main south-to-north road linking the southern port of Aden -- controlled by Hadi's government -- to the Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa. A contested frontline runs across the province.
""I urge a thorough investigation, and I express my appreciation to the Government of Yemen for the work they have begun in this regard. I also remain gravely concerned by the continuation of media campaigns in parts of Yemen that spread rumors and incitement against aid operations,"" Lowcock said.
Yemen's war has killed thousands and pushed millions to the brink of famine. Around 80% of the population needs humanitarian assistance."

More than 18 years after U.S.-led forces toppled the hardline Taliban regime, Afghan forces are suffering record casualties with Afghan and U.S. officials warning that the toll is not sustainable.
Despite a winter lull in fighting due to heavy snowfall in the mountains where the Islamist Taliban typically rest and regroup ahead of their annual spring offensive, assaults on vulnerable security checkpoints continue across the country.
Mohammad Yousuf, the district governor of Dawlatabad where the incident took place said, said dozens of Taliban insurgents targeted a checkpoint manned jointly by Afghan soldiers and intelligence agents, killing 15.
An Afghan Defence Ministry statement said seven soldiers had been killed. The ministry tends not to provide exact figures on its casualties sustained in fighting with the Taliban.
The Taliban, fighting to oust foreign forces and overthrow the Western-backed Kabul government, claimed responsibility and said at least 20 members of the security forces were killed, six wounded and four captured. The Taliban often inflates casualty figure they inflict on Afghan government forces.
As Afghan security force casualties mounted this year, the government pulled back from hundreds of checkpoints in isolated areas that acted as a magnet for Taliban attacks.
Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians, members of the security forces and 2,400 U.S. military personnel have been killed in fighting since 2001."
26,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 03:41AM ET</span>",UK's Queen Elizabeth stresses reconciliation after 'quite bumpy' 2019,"LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth will stress the value of harmony and reconciliation in her Christmas message this year, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday, after a ""quite bumpy"" year for her own family and for Britain as it struggled with Brexit.
The palace released two short extracts from the 93-year-old monarch's televised Christmas Day message, including one on the life of Jesus and the importance of reconciliation.
There was no indication of whether the queen will mention more painful aspects of 2019 for the royal family, particularly the furor over her son Prince Andrew's links to U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Andrew has said he regretted his ""ill-judged"" association with Epstein but never saw anything suspicious during the time he spent with the financier who committed suicide in jail in August after being arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14. Epstein denied the charges.
Andrew has also denied allegations by a woman who said she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends, including the prince, when she was 17.
Along with her 98-year-old husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, being involved in a car crash in January and spending the run-up to Christmas in hospital for checks, and her grandsons Princes William and Harry publicly falling out, it has been what many commentators have called another ""annus horribilis"" for her.
That was how she described 1992, when three of her children's marriages - including that of Prince Charles to Princess Diana - collapsed and a fire severely damaged her Windsor Castle home.
On reconciliation, the queen talks in the excerpts of ""how small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held differences and deep-seated divisions to bring harmony and understanding ...""
She adds: ""The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of difference.""
Britain's regional and political divisions have been exacerbated in the 3-1/2 years since it voted to leave the EU.
A landslide election win for Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson this month enabled him finally to win approval for his Brexit deal in parliament, but also re-awakened calls north of the border for another referendum on Scottish independence.
Newspapers pored over details in the excerpts of the queen's message and the Times noted that a collection of family photographs on her desk seemed to focus attention on the direct line of succession.
Alongside a framed photograph of her son Charles with his wife Camilla, another showed William with his family including six-year-old Prince George. The queen's father, the late King George VI, also appeared.
But the collection of photographs did not include any of Harry and his wife Meghan, unlike last year when the queen showed a picture of their wedding, the Times said.
The Daily Mirror noted there was no picture of Andrew either.
The Queen's message was filmed at Windsor Castle, west of London, and produced by the BBC."

The boats were fishing for octopus near the disputed islands when they were detained by Russian ships on Dec. 17 for investigation on suspicion they had violated fishing agreements, the Japanese government said.
""The five ships and crew members, 24 in total, left for Nemuro, Hokkaido, at around 10 a.m. (0100 GMT),"" Suga told a regular news conference, referring to a port on Japan's main northern island.
""They are expected to arrive at Nemuro this evening. At the moment, there's no problem with the health of the crew members.""
Kyodo news agency, quoting a Russian border guard official, said the release came after the crews paid a fine of about 6.4 million rubles ($103,000) ordered by a Russian court on Monday for violating regulations on the size of the catch Japanese vessels can take around the islands.
Following the detentions, Suga said the crews had done nothing wrong and the seizure was unacceptable.
Japan claims a string of Russian-held islands off its northern region of Hokkaido, which it calls the Northern Territories.
Known in Russia as the Southern (NYSE:SO) Kuriles, the islands were invaded by the then-Soviet army in the waning days of World War Two. The dispute over the islands has prevented Russia and Japan from signing a formal peace treaty."

North Korea has set a year-end deadline for the United States to change what it says is a policy of hostility amid a stalemate in efforts to make progress on their pledge to end the North's nuclear program and establish lasting peace.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since June 2018, but there has been no substantive progress in dialogue while the North demanded crushing international sanctions be lifted first.
Speaking in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu following a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Moon said the three countries agreed on the need for close communication.
""South Korea, China, Japan, the three countries, agreed to continue close communication and cooperation toward denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula,"" Moon said at a joint news conference. 
""We shared a view that peace on the Korean Peninsula is in the common interest of the three countries, and decided to work together to ensure that denuclearization and peace continue through prompt North Korea-U.S. dialogue,"" he added.
Li said that the three leaders reaffirmed the need to seek a resolution to the North Korean issue via dialogue and for the three to cooperate in this regard.
China is North Korea's most important economic and diplomatic backer, though Beijing has been angered by Pyongyang's repeated missile and nuclear tests.
U.S. special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun met with two senior Chinese diplomats during his two-day visit to Beijing last week, following similar meetings in South Korea and Japan days earlier, as diplomats make last-ditch attempts to prevent new confrontation.
Beijing, together with Russia, proposed last week that the United Nations Security Council lift some sanctions in what it calls an attempt to break the current deadlock and seek to build support. 

But it is unclear whether Beijing can convince Seoul and Tokyo to break ranks with Washington, which has made its opposition clear and can veto any resolution.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand police said on Tuesday they were ending the search for the bodies of two people still missing following the deadly eruption of a volcano earlier this month. 
""The search for the two missing victims of the Whakaari/ White Island eruption has been suspended,"" Bay of Plenty District Commander, Superintendent Andy McGregor said in a statement.
""The families of the two missing people have been informed of this decision. Police remain ready to respond if new information comes to light,"" he added.
Those still missing, presumed dead, are Winona Langford, a 17-year-old Australian tourist, and Hayden Marshall-Inman, a 40-year-old New Zealand tour guide. Their bodies are thought to have been swept into the ocean around the uninhabited volcanic island. 
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters he had not been updated on the situation due to being focused on severe bushfires at home, but said the New Zealand government had done all it could to recover the bodies. 
""I have no doubt that they are exhausting every, every channel available to them to recover those remains,"" Morrison said.
""I can only say thank you, kia ora to New Zealand, and for everything that they've done to assist the Australians and Australian families,"" he said using a Māori expression of thanks.
The majority of the victims the powerful eruption of White Island, also known by its Māori name of Whakaari, were Australian citizens or permanent residents. 
Police said on Monday one of those injured during the eruption had died in an Auckland hospital on the weekend, bringing the official death toll to 17.
There has been criticism that tourists were allowed on the island, a popular destination for day-trippers, given the risks of an active volcano. That has led to speculation the tragedy could lead to major changes for New Zealand's thrillseeker tourism industry.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said official inquiries by coroners and work safety regulators into the eruption could take up to a year, and will carry potential criminal penalties of up to five years in jail.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Calls for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to resign have littered social media platforms after it was revealed he was holidaying in Hawaii while the country battled a bushfire emergency and his return has failed to douse the criticism.
Voters have taken to social media calling for leadership at a time of crisis, and along with some of the country's political editors, have criticized Morrison's refusal to take tougher action on climate change.
Similar to the criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump by American comedians, Morrison has been ridiculed on social media, portrayed as a deformed creature sitting in a burned out forest on Christmas Day patting a lump of coal he calls ""precious"" to a flying superhero called ""Bullshit Man"".
On Twitter on Tuesday, #NotMyPrimeMinister, #MorrisonMustGo and #ScoMoResign were the top trending topics in Australia after a viral video showed a volunteer firefighter, Jacqui, shaking hands with Morrison as she said ""not my prime minister"".
""Jacquie is all of us,"" Twitter user Yabba said. Another user @bugwannostra tweeted ""she's only saying what more than 12 million think...""
The tweet prompted Morrison to issue a clarification on Tuesday. ""Indeed, as Jacqui joked with me yesterday, I’m not her PM, because she's British, Boris Johnson is,"" he tweeted.
Devastating bushfires have burned more than 4 million hectares (9.88 million acres) of land across five states and killed nine people since September.
Uncontrolled fires are still burning in South Australia, after ripping through the state's prominent wine region, and around the country's largest city Sydney.
Hazardous smoke blanketed Sydney for days this month, heightening public anger and raising political pressure on the government to do more to battle climate change.
When it was revealed Morrison and his family had slipped away to Hawaii for a holiday voters became angry.
On his return Morrison further inflamed his political critics by saying there would be no change to climate policy and denied suggestions of a split within his government after his deputy agreed more action was needed.
He also ruled out holding a summit with the nation's fire chiefs and compensation for thousands of volunteer firefighters who have battled blazes for months.
A series of photo opportunities of Morrison with firefighters and animals affected by the fires was ridiculed on social media on Tuesday.
Morrison stunned the nation in May by winning an election, securing a parliamentary majority, but his political capital six months later is now being questioned.
""He has lost any personal link to that deep, crucial, reservoir of gravitas we confer, automatically, on our PMs simply because of their position,"" The Canberra Times newspaper columnist Nicholas Stuart wrote on Tuesday.
But some analysts say it is too early to write Morrison's political epitaph, but concede Australia's summer bushfires may eventually see a change in climate policy.
In Australia, the world's largest exporter of coal, climate and energy policy have infused politics for a decade, helping to bring down both liberal and conservative lawmakers.
Australia is one of the world's largest carbon emitters per capita due to coal-fired power plants. It has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but critics say Morrison is paying lip service to the commitment.
""These bushfires could potentially lead to a shift in public opinion and public concern on climate change that we have not seen in Australia so far,"" said Haydon Manning, professor at the college of business, government and law at Flinders University."

Authorities have accused Brazil, Colombia and Peru - all adversaries of socialist Maduro who recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as the rightful president - of complicity with the attack, in which one Venezuelan soldier was killed. All three countries' governments have denied involvement.
In an evening address on state television, Maduro called on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to cooperate.
""Capture the assailants in Brazilian territory and return the weapons to the Venezuelan armed forces,"" Maduro said.
He said the 11 detainees included both military and civilian suspects, without providing details.
Authorities have blamed ""extreme sectors of the opposition"" for the raid. Venezuela, whose economy has collapsed under Maduro, has been locked in a deep political crisis since Guaido, the head of the opposition-held National Assembly, assumed a rival presidency in January. 
Maduro dismisses Guaido as a U.S. puppet seeking to oust him in a coup. 
Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said in an earlier address on Monday that Darwin Balaguera, a former National Guard member who deserted in February and fled to Colombia, was detained over the raid. The channel broadcast video of Balaguera answering authorities' questions in custody. 
Balaguera was among hundreds of Venezuelan soldiers who defected to Colombia during a Guaido-led attempt to bring humanitarian aid into the country through Colombia and Brazil in February. Some have said they are prepared to take up arms to remove Maduro.
Olnar Ortiz, an attorney with nonprofit rights group Penal Forum, said at least seven members of the Pemon indigenous group were arrested in connection with the incident. Ortiz said four other Pemon individuals were missing.
Ortiz said authorities raided homes in the Pemon village of Kumarakapay near Venezuela's border with Brazil on Sunday evening, searching for suspected participants in the raid. 
""They are criminalizing everyone without concrete evidence, without respect for due process,"" Ortiz said. 
There were deadly confrontations between indigenous Pemon and authorities during the February aid effort. Troops loyal to Maduro blocked the aid from entering.

DENVER (Reuters) - While the North American Aerospace Defense Command stays alert for any signs of a North Korea missile launch – what officials in Pyongyang have described as a ""Christmas gift"" – it is also tracking the legendary figure who delivers presents to children across the world, the command said on Monday.
Based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, NORAD is a combined U.S. and Canadian military command whose mission is to issue aerospace and maritime warnings and controls across North America.
For more than six decades, it has also offered real-time animated tracking of Santa Claus, also known as Kris Kringle, as his reindeer-powered sleigh traverses the globe delivering Yuletide gifts to children.
“As NORAD conducts its primary mission of defending North America from threats, we’re proud to continue our tradition of tracking Santa’s journey around the world,” NORAD said in a statement.
NORAD’s Santa tracking website www.noradsanta.org gets nearly 15 million unique visitors from more than 200 countries and territories across the globe, the agency said.
NORAD in recent years has been tracking North Korean long-range missile tests. Pyongyang warned Washington earlier this month of a possible “Christmas gift”. That came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gave the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions in talks over his country’s nuclear arsenal and reducing tensions between the two long-time adversaries.
NORAD’s Santa-tracking tradition started in 1955 when a Colorado Springs department store misprinted the phone number to the North Pole in a newspaper advertisement, according to its website.
The first call came from a little girl and went to U.S. Air Force Colonel Harry Shoup, director of what was then known as the Continental Air Defense Command.
The colonel assured the girl that Santa was on en route, and when more children called the command center, the military added a new task to its defense mission.
Renamed NORAD three years later as a combined Canadian and U.S. agency, the Santa mission has continued uninterrupted ever since. Santa watchers can now track his whereabouts through NORAD’s Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter, Instagram and YouTube accounts.

PICTON, Australia (Reuters) - When Australian volunteer firefighter Andrew Hain is out battling bushfires, he sends emojis to his wife Kate to let her know he is safe.
They've also discussed that ""no news is good news"" and that she shouldn't needlessly worry if he goes into rugged or remote bushland with no telephone reception.
Hain, a father-of-two, is one of several thousand volunteer firefighters that Australian communities rely on to combat bushfires, an ever pervasive threat in the continent's hot and dry climate.
This summer fire season, however, is fast turning into one of the worst on record, heaping pressure on volunteers and their families.
Two volunteer firefighters were killed last week when their truck was struck by a falling tree as it traveled to a fire front. [nL4N28T4K5]
""I have a little emoji of a bald guy with a bit of facial growth giving a thumbs up, and so every hour or so I try and send that emoji to her and she knows that I'm OK,"" Andrew Hain told Reuters, shortly after fighting fires in the Wollondilly Shire, south of Sydney.
""We get into some places and there's not a lot of reception and you know, we've got a sort of thing in place that no news is good news, if she doesn't hear from me. So, we've got plans around it to try and put her mind at ease.""
A total of six people have died in bushfires which have destroyed more than 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) across five states since they first erupted in spring in an early and ominous start to the bushfire season.
The eastern state of New South Wales is the worst affected with nearly 100 fires. A mega blaze northwest of Sydney, the country's largest city, is the biggest bushfire on record, burning some 335,000 hectares (830,000 acres).
A three-year drought and record high temperatures have created more intense bushfires this season, say firefighters, already weary from months on the firegrounds and staring down two more months of summer heat.
Nightly television footage of exhausted volunteer firefighters and the ferocious fires they are battling has sparked debate over whether volunteers should be compensated.
Hain, a flight route planner at airline Qantas, has given up much of his end-of-year holidays to fight the fires. His young family have left their home to stay in Sydney while the fire threat looms.
His wife Kate is proud of him for contributing so strongly to the local community, but says it comes at a cost.
""We get nothing and they expect the amount of time and effort and danger they put themselves in, it's just expected. I find that just amazing, that nobody gives us anything,"" she said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Monday sparred over the shape of an impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying he has not ruled out hearing from witnesses as Democrats have demanded.
McConnell, speaking on Fox News, stopped short of agreeing to a Democratic request for the Senate to agree ahead of time to take testimony during the trial expected to begin in early 2020. He cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, which ended in acquittal, as a model.
""We haven't ruled out witnesses,"" McConnell said in an interview with ""Fox & Friends."" ""We've said, 'Let's handle this case just like we did with President Clinton.' Fair is fair.""
In that 1999 trial, he said, senators went through opening arguments, had a written question period and then decided what witnesses to call. There was limited testimony by video.
Allowing witness testimony, particularly from current and former administration officials, was likely to prolong the trial and could bring up new evidence damaging to Republican Trump who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last week.
Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, said the trial must include witnesses. He urged his Senate colleagues to call for the release of relevant Trump administration documents.
""It's hard to imagine a trial not having documents and witnesses. If it doesn't have documents and witnesses, it's going to seem - to most of the American people - that it is a sham trial, a show trial,"" Schumer said at a press conference in New York.
The House voted along party lines to impeach Trump on two charges over his pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and Biden's son. Biden is a potential Democratic candidate to run against Trump in the November 2020 election. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
Trump was charged with abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation. He has said he did nothing wrong. There is little chance Trump will be convicted and removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate.
Trump on Monday accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, a bid to pressure Senate Republicans to reach an accord with Schumer on trial rules. McConnell said the Senate could not take any action until it receives the articles. 
""What right does Crazy Nancy have to hold up this Senate trial. None! She has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision. This Witch Hunt must end NOW with a trial in the Senate, or let her default & lose. No more time should be wasted on this Impeachment Scam!"" Trump said on Twitter.

Schumer has requested to have four witnesses subpoenaed for the trial. The White House blocked all four, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, from testifying during impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives in December.

The palace released two short extracts from the 93-year-old monarch's televised Christmas Day message, one on the 75th anniversary of the World War Two D-Day landings, the other on the life of Jesus and the importance of reconciliation.
There was no indication of whether the Queen will mention more painful aspects of 2019 for the royal family, particularly the furor over her son Prince Andrew's links to disgraced U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Along with her 98-year-old husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, being involved in a car crash in January and having to spend this Christmas in hospital for checks, it has been what many commentators have called another ""annus horribilis"" for her.
That was how she described 1992, when three of her children's marriages - including that of Prince Charles to Princess Diana - collapsed and a fire severely damaged her Windsor Castle home.
In Tuesday's extracts, the Queen said of D-Day: ""For the 75th anniversary of that decisive battle, in a true spirit of reconciliation, those who had formerly been sworn enemies came together in friendly commemorations either side of the Channel, putting past differences behind them ...
""By being willing to put past differences behind us and move forward together, we honor the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost.""
On reconciliation, she talks of ""how small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held differences and deep-seated divisions to bring harmony and understanding ...""
She adds: ""The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of difference.""
Britain's regional and political divisions have been exacerbated in the 3-1/2 years since it voted to leave the EU.
A landslide election win for Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson this month enabled him finally to win approval for his Brexit deal in parliament, but also re-awakened calls north of the border for another referendum on Scottish independence.

The Queen's message was filmed at Windsor Castle, west of London, and produced by the BBC.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 06:28PM ET</span>",Young democrats shake up pro-Beijing stronghold in Hong Kong,"By Kate Lamb and Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - For decades it was known as Little Shanghai, a gritty, waterfront neighborhood that was the landing spot for many mainland Chinese emigrating to Hong Kong.
Densely packed with dilapidated, high-rise apartment blocks looming above bustling neon-lit streets, North Point has long been known as one of the ""reddest"" – or most pro-Beijing – districts in Hong Kong.
During anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong this year, the district was the scene of street brawls between men in white T-shirts - believed to be pro-Beijing supporters – and black-clad protesters. 
But in elections for District Councils in November, a neighborhood that has long hewed to the pro-Beijing line of Hong Kong's government unexpectedly switched sides. Pro-democracy candidates won four out of five seats in the district, up from one in the last election. In the adjacent Fortress Hill neighborhood, they added another two.
""They called my fight one of the hardest fights,"" says Karrine Fu, 23, an arts graduate who won a seat in North Point as an independent after defeating Hung Lin-cham, a pro-Beijing secondary school teacher who had held the seat for 12 years. ""For my district they called it a miracle.""
Fu's narrow victory in the district council elections – she defeated her opponent by just 59 votes out of 4,869 – was part of a democratic domino effect across Hong Kong, suggesting strong support for the ongoing protests that have roiled the Chinese-ruled city for more than six months. Pro-democratic candidates secured almost 90% of the seats.
The reverberations of the election were keenly felt in North Point, where many inhabitants – like Fu's grandparents – hail from the southern Chinese province of Fujian, up the coast from Hong Kong. 
The signs of that older generation are visible across North Point – the vintage Sunbeam Cantonese opera theater still thrives in the district, and at the Shanghai Great Chinese Barber Shop, the barbers trimming the ever-thinning hair of elderly customers say little has changed in five decades. 
Fu said she was able to connect in Fujianese - her ancestral dialect – with older voters in the district, many of whom have close ties to the mainland and tend to vote for pro-government candidates. 
""I think some old Fujianese secretly supported me,"" Fu said with a laugh.  ""When I was walking through the street recently I saw residents going up to my opponent and saying they were sad he lost. But when they walked past me they put their thumbs up.""
NEW FACES
In North Point and Fortress Hill, six of seven pro-democracy candidates - five of them in their 20s - won seats on the District Councils. 
Four years ago, there was only one.
The newly elected councillors have formed a liberal alliance to capitalize on their gains and give political heft to the calls on the streets for democratic reforms in Hong Kong. 
Earlier this month, they met in the North Point office of Cheng Tat-hung, 31, who was elected to a council seat for the Civic Party, to discuss their extraordinary win. Cheng's cat, ""Churchill"", was curled up on a couch, surrounded by shelves crammed with books and papers.
Until now, pro-democracy candidates had never held more than a toehold in the district, but the protest movement has made ""many people in North Point awake"", said Cheng, who is studying to become a barrister. 
Largely strangers months ago, the new councillors now meet regularly to discuss how they are going to shake up Hong Kong politics.
Once officially installed on Jan. 1, they plan to hold community ""democracy forums"", lobby for rent ceilings in government apartments, and question police about alleged brutality in dealing with protesters and their response to dealing with the attacks by pro-Beijing supporters.
""We had a landslide win for pro-democracy candidates,"" said James Pui, a psychology graduate who was elected as an independent candidate. ""Now we can coordinate to make changes for the whole of Hong Kong.""
The police have defended their actions as being necessary to break up protests that have often become violent.
    The significant political shift has also raised questions about whether the democratic gains will be replicated in legislative elections next year. While the District Council seats are all directly elected, roughly half of all Legislative Council members are indirectly elected through largely pro-China industry and professional groups.
    ""What we want is hope. Everyone knows Hong Kong's political institutions are very unfair, it is just a semi-democracy,"" said Lee Yue-shun, 26, who also won a seat as a candidate from North Point. ""We firmly believe this is not the end.""
    The elections for the District Councils, which oversee issues like the installation of bus stop shelters or garbage collection, were once viewed as perfunctory and few people bothered to vote. But this year, as protests raged across Hong Kong, the elections drew a record number of voters.
Sparked by a controversial and now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed defendants to be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China, the protest movement has since June spiraled into a battle for wider democratic freedoms, highlighting deep-seated anxiety and anger about China.
    ""Everyone is a stakeholder in the game, and they will try to do whatever they can,"" said Pui. ""That's what triggered the voters to come out.""
RESISTANCE TO CHANGE
    Political change, however, has not come easily.
    Jocelyn Chau, a 23-year-old who won in a constituency bordering North Point, and was arrested during one protest, said she has been repeatedly harassed and attacked.
Posters of Chau's face were plastered around a subway station and a market accusing her of using her looks for political gain, alongside insults such as ""super rioter"" and ""shit for brains"".
   She said she had received threatening anonymous phone calls and was punched in the face after giving out a passer-by a campaign leaflet. She posted on social media a video of the attack, which Reuters was unable to independently confirm.
Opposition to the new order is also evident when taking to residents of the district.
Reflecting on the polls after a dim sum breakfast, Frank Chan, an 82-year-old North Point retiree who described himself as pro-government, said the result was ""jaw-dropping"".
""I don't know if these young people have been poisoned or what they have been taught,"" said Chan, as he stood on a pier watching boats pass in the harbor. Just down the road, fishmongers hawked their wares along the harbourfront. ""I don’t understand the new mindset, these young people are so different from us.""
On a Saturday afternoon this month, the new North Point and Fortress Hill councillors set up street-side tables to hand out calendars and chocolate breakfast cereal, and invite the public to pen Christmas cards for protesters who have been injured or detained.
But while some younger North Point residents stopped to sign cards, not everyone was receptive to the efforts of the newly elected councillors. Discussions with some of the more conservative residents, said Fu, were reminiscent of recent battles in her own family.
""At first my father called the protesters cockroaches but after the election he finally understood that what we are fighting for is democracy,"" she said, while taking a short break from the booth.

    ""And he can accept that we came to Hong Kong for democracy. Otherwise we can just go back to mainland China.""

The barge sank on Sunday after a crane at the La Predial dock of San Cristobal - the easternmost island of the Galapagos archipelago - fell while unloading cargo, Ecuador's navy said in a statement on Twitter.
Located around 1,000 kilometers from mainland Ecuador, the Galapagos Islands are home to a variety of flora and fauna that famously helped inspire Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution following his 1835 visit. 
The islands, which are included on the world heritage list of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), were labeled as at risk in 2007 after population growth, fishing, and tourism had put pressure on natural resources there, though the designation was removed in 2010 following work by Ecuador.
The crane was taking off a container holding an electricity generator when it fell into the vessel, causing it to sink. Ledesma said the sunken generator was the source of the oil seen in the water. 
The vessel was carrying the fuel for its own operations, Ledesma told Reuters. ""It was not transporting fuel,"" he said. ""The oils that are leaking are from the machine that was inside the container, so this is the oil that can be seen leaking."" 
Ecuador's Navy, alongside authorities from the Galapagos National Park, placed barriers and hydrocarbon-absorbing cloths around the stricken vessel to prevent the dispersal of anything that might leak.
One person was injured in the incident, said the attorney general's office, which is investigating.
""This fuel spill could have caused serious effects on the sensitive ecosystem of this protected area,"" the attorney general's office said. 
Ledesma said sea iguanas and two sea lions had been tested following the accident but added that no bad effects on their health had been reported.
The minister said that while the situation was under control, authorities could not afford to relax.
""We are very concerned about the recovery work of the tanks because there could be a potential spill if it is not done efficiently and swiftly,"" he said.

A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Washington is ""dismayed"" by the Zambian government’s statement that 
Ambassador Daniel Foote’s position “is no longer tenable.” 
""Despite this action, the United States remains committed to our partnership with the Zambian people,"" the spokesperson said. ""We seek an open and frank relationship of mutual respect, commensurate with the generous aid provided to the Zambian people by the United States.""
Zambia's high court last month jailed the male gay couple for 15 years for engaging in sexual relations ""against the order of nature"", a decision the U.S. ambassador said was horrifying. 
President Edgar Lungu said on Dec. 15 that Zambia, a major beneficiary of U.S. aid, had sent a protest letter to Washington over the remarks by Foote and was awaiting a response.
A U.S. embassy source who is not allowed to issue statements told Reuters that Washington had decided to recall its ambassador because it was difficult for him to work in Zambia.
""Since Lungu says he does not want to work with Foote, there was no point of him remaining. Also don't forget that there are security issues so Washington want their man back,"" the source said.
""The U.S. cannot be paying a salary to someone who cannot work because the hosts don't want him,"" a second U.S. embassy source said.
Zambia's foreign affairs ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Zambia receives hundreds of millions of dollars every year in financial support from the United States, some of which goes toward fighting HIV/AIDS.
African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive laws governing homosexuality. Same-sex relationships are considered taboo and gay sex is a crime across most of the continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.

""The United States firmly opposes abuses against LGBTI persons. Governments have an obligation to ensure that all people can freely enjoy the universal human rights and fundamental freedoms to which they are entitled,"" the State Department spokesperson said.

The decision came after the State Department's Office of Inspector General identified in September the deaths of two dogs sent to Jordan, the largest recipient of the dogs. A second report released last Friday put the total deaths at seven.
Some 135 dogs are in the Antiterrorism Assistance Program, which helps eight countries with border and aviation security. Dogs already working in Jordan and Egypt will remain there while U.S. authorities demand measures to improve the animals' conditions and handling, a State Department official told reporters.
Prompted by a hotline complaint after the September report, the Inspector General found that two more dogs sent to Jordan had died, one of heat stroke and another of poisoning from insecticide sprayed in or near the kennel.
Three of the 10 dogs sent to Egypt under the program also died: one of lung cancer, one from a ruptured gall bladder and the other from heat stroke, the report found.
The September report said Zoe, a 2-year-old Belgian Malinois, had died in 2017 from heat stroke while working at the Syrian border. Mencey, a 3-year-old Belgian Malinois, was euthanized in the United States in 2018 after he had been returned from Jordan for treatment of a tick-borne disease.
According to the September report, a veterinarian told the Inspector General's office that ""heat injuries are cases of negligence and improper care and are not accidental"" and that dogs who die of heat stroke ""suffer a terrible death.""
The Inspector General found that dogs were sent to the foreign partners without signed written agreements outlining standards of care and that there were no adequate follow-up checks on dogs' wellbeing.
""Improving health and welfare is something that's continual and gradual. It will not happen overnight, and that's why improving kennel conditions, improving how many times they check on the canines - those are all things we're actively working on,"" another State Department official said."

The deal between Ankara and Tripoli carves out a corridor of maritime boundaries between Libya and Turkey, potentially clearing the way for oil and gas exploration there.
Greece, which is a close ally of Israel and is at odds with Turkey over a host of issues, called the accord absurd because it ignored the presence of the Greek island of Crete between the coasts of Turkey and Libya.
The Israeli government had previously made no public comment on the accord, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Greece next week to solidify plans with Greece and Cyprus to build a subsea pipeline to export gas from Israel to Europe.
Nicosia said that Netanyahu had told Cyprus' president last Friday that the maritime deal was to be condemned as ""illegal"".
Asked to confirm the Cypriot account, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said: ""That is the official position of Israel. But that doesn't mean we are sending battleships to confront Turkey.""

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Monday sentenced five people to death and three more to jail over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year and said the killing was not premeditated, a verdict criticized by a U.N. investigator as a ""mockery"" of justice. 
A senior U.S. official said the verdicts were ""an important step"" in holding those responsible for the crime accountable and encouraged Saudi Arabia to continue with a fair and transparent judicial process.
The court dismissed charges against the remaining three of the 11 people that had been on trial, finding them not guilty, Saudi Deputy Public Prosecutor and spokesman Shalaan al-Shalaan said. None of the defendants' names was immediately released.
""The investigation showed that the killing was not premeditated ... The decision was taken at the spur of the moment,"" Shalaan said, a position contradicting the findings of a United Nations-led investigation.
Khashoggi was a U.S. resident and critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler. He was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, where he had gone to obtain documents for his impending wedding. His body was reportedly dismembered and removed from the building, and his remains have not been found.
Eleven Saudi suspects were put on trial over his death in secretive proceedings in the capital Riyadh.
Khashoggi's murder caused a global uproar, tarnishing the crown prince's image. The CIA and some Western governments have said they believe Prince Mohammed, also known as MbS, ordered the killing.
Saudi officials say he had no role, though in September MbS for the first time indicated some personal accountability, saying ""it happened under my watch"". 
Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur for extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, lambasted the trial verdict as a ""mockery"" of justice.
""The hit-men are guilty, sentenced to death. The masterminds not only walk free, they have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial,"" she said on Twitter. 
The U.N.-led inquiry reported in February that the evidence pointed to ""a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated"" by Saudi officials. 
TWO SENIOR FIGURES FREED AFTER PROBE
Last November the Saudi prosecutor said Saud al-Qahtani, a former high-profile Saudi royal adviser, had discussed Khashoggi's activities before he entered the Saudi consulate with the team which went on to kill him. 
The prosecutor had said Qahtani acted in coordination with deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Asiri, who he said had ordered Khashoggi's repatriation from Turkey and that the lead negotiator on the ground then decided to kill him.
Both men were dismissed from their positions but while Asiri was tried, Qahtani was not. 
On Monday Shalaan said Asiri has been tried and released due to insufficient evidence, and Qahtani had been investigated but was not charged and had been released.
Shalaan also said the Saudi consul-general to Turkey at the time, Mohammed al-Otaibi, had been freed after Turkish witnesses said Otaibi had been with them on the day of the crime. Two weeks ago, the United States barred Otaibi from entering the country. 
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last year that Maher Mutreb, the lead negotiator, and Salah al-Tubaigy, a forensic expert specializing in autopsies, were also on trial for the murder and could face the death penalty. 
On Monday Shalaan said that when the Saudi team that entered the consulate saw it would not be possible to transfer Khashoggi to a safe place to continue negotiating, they decided to kill him. 
""It was agreed, in consultation between the head of the negotiating team and the culprits, to kill Jamal Khashoggi inside the consulate,"" Shalaan said in response to questions from journalists. 
31 PEOPLE INVESTIGATED
Noting the verdict, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the need for ""an independent and impartial investigation into the murder"", a spokesman said. 
Turkey said on Monday the trial outcome was far from serving justice and repeated its call for better Saudi judicial cooperation. 
""The fact that important issues like the location of the late Khashoggi's body, the identification of the instigators and, if there are any, the local co-operators, are still in the dark is a fundamental shortcoming to justice being served and accountability,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said. 
Callamard, the U.N. rapporteur, criticized the trial for having been held behind closed doors, saying that the conditions in international law for doing so had not been met. 
Human rights group Amnesty International also criticized the closed trial, branding the verdict a ""whitewash"" that it said failed to address the Saudi authorities' involvement or the location of Khashoggi's remains.
However, one of Khashoggi's sons - who weeks after the murder appealed publicly for the return of his father's body - said the verdicts had been fair to his children.
""We affirm our confidence in the Saudi judiciary at all levels, that it has been fair to us and that justice has been achieved,"" Salah Khashoggi said on Twitter.
On Twitter, a favorite platform for government supporters, many Saudis hailed Qahtani's exoneration, sharing pictures and describing him as a ""loyal defender of the kingdom"".
Last week Twitter removed 6,000 accounts it said appeared to be linked ""to a significant state-backed information operation"" originating in Saudi Arabia. 
Riyadh's criminal court pronounced the death penalty on five defendants ""for committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim"". The three sentenced to prison were given various sentences totaling 24 years ""for their role in covering up this crime and violating the law"". 
Shalaan added the investigations proved there was no ""prior enmity"" between those convicted and Khashoggi. 

The verdicts can still be appealed.

Jemli, who was nominated as prime minister by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party last month after it took most seats in October's parliamentary election, last week asked President Kais Saied for more time to form a government.
Talks to build a ruling coalition capable of winning a vote of confidence have proved difficult because the October election produced a fractured parliament in which no party held more than a quarter of seats.
Several of the main parties have either ruled out joining the government altogether or said they would not join if one or other major party was also involved, or if they did not secure several of the most important portfolios.
Jemli told Reuters last month he was a week away from announcing the government, but then failed to do so.
Tunisia, which adopted democracy after its 2011 revolution that sparked the ""Arab spring"" uprisings, has faced economic difficulties over the past eight years that have at times threatened to undermine its political transition.
The next government faces a difficult task in continuing economic reforms to bring its deficits and debt under tighter control, as demanded by foreign lenders, while raising growth and delivering better public services."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's President Sebastian Pinera on Monday signed off on a referendum to be held on a new constitution, which he vowed would generate a ""solid, compassionate and legitimate framework"" that would help reunify the country after nine weeks of intense protest over inequality and elitism.
Pinera said the plebiscite, which was approved by Congress last week and is to be held next year, would kickstart a process of ""broad and effective citizen participation.""
""It is of the utmost importance to recover the value of unity, of dialogue, of agreements, especially with those who think differently,"" he added.
Chileans will on Sunday April 26 decide whether they want a new constitution and if they do, whether the body that draws up the new document should be a popularly elected assembly or one mixed with current lawmakers.
The country's current constitution dates back to General Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 military dictatorship and, critics say, fails to guarantee proper healthcare, education and citizen participation in government.
The scrapping of the old constitution emerged as one of the main demands of protesters who have mobilized across the country over the two months.
A poll by Cadem last month suggested that 82% of Chileans believe the country needs a new constitution and 60% want it drawn up by a popularly elected assembly, compared with 35% who want a mix with politicians.
The president said he hoped the new constitution ""should serve to leave behind the violence and divisions that we have seen resurface with pain and sadness during these days"".
On Friday a demonstration brought chaotic scenes in Santiago's central Plaza Italia rallying point, where an estimated 1,500 demonstrators clashed with as many as 1,000 police officers, resulting in a 20-year-old protester being run over by a police armored vehicle."

""There won't be a midnight mass at Notre-Dame. The last time this happened was during the French Revolution. Since 1803, there have always been Christmas masses at Notre-Dame,"" a Paris diocese spokeswoman told Reuters.
The April 15 fire caused the roof and spire to collapse although the main bell towers and the outer walls were saved, along with religious relics and priceless works of art.
""It's painful because we would have liked to celebrate Christmas at Notre-Dame but, at the same time, there is also hope: we're pressing ahead with the rebuilding, for example this huge crane which will help remove this damn scaffolding,"" said Monsignor Patrick Chauvet, the cathedral's senior administrative cleric.
He was referring to the metal scaffolding, erected before the blaze for maintenance work, that melted in the fire and had to be disentangled from the cathedral's structure before it could be removed.
""Christmas is the celebration of hope. Let's be patient, four more years"", Chauvet added, inviting those who used to come to Notre-Dame for Christmas to go to nearby Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, one of the oldest churches in Paris.
Archbishop of Paris Michel Aupetit, who would normally say Christmas mass in Notre-Dame, will this year officiate at the Grüss Circus in the Bois de Boulogne, the diocese said.
Notre-Dame, which dates back to the 12th century, features in Victor Hugo's novel ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"". It was also there that Napoleon was crowned Emperor in 1804."

Marco Cappato, a member of Italy's small Radical party, accompanied a 40-year-old blind and tetraplegic Italian former disc jockey, Fabiano Antoniani, better known as DJ Fabo, to take his own life at a Swiss clinic in 2017.
The constitutional court ruled in September that it was not always a crime to help someone in ""intolerable suffering"" to kill themselves, opening the way to Monday's verdict clearing Cappato.
The prosecutor in the case, Tiziana Siciliano, had herself requested the acquittal following the constitutional court's ruling.
""This is a historic day because the court's decision fully reflects article 2 of the constitution, which puts the individual, and not the state, at the center of social life,"" Siciliano said after Monday's verdict.
Catholic Italy is slowly adapting its legislation and legal precedent toward a less rigid position on assisted suicide.
In December 2017 a law was passed allowing severely ill people to refuse treatment that would prolong their lives. 
That legislation, which was fiercely opposed by right-wing parties, was one of the first cases of collaboration between the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party, which have governed together since September.
Cappato faces another trial in February over a similar case to that of DJ Fabo, in which he helped a 53-year-old suffering from motor neurone disease to die in a Swiss clinic.

ANKARA/BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Turkish delegation was in Russia on Monday for talks on Syria, following reports that Russian-backed attacks there were forcing tens of thousands more Syrians to flee towards Turkey.
Turkey already hosts about 3.7 million Syrians - the world's biggest refugee population. Its President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday it could not handle a new influx and was urging Russia to stop the strikes in Syria's northwestern Idlib province. 
The Turkey-based Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) said on Monday 120,000 Syrians were fleeing towards the Turkish border - higher than Erdogan's estimate of 80,000.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to recapture the Idlib region, the last significant area of Syria still under rebel control after 8-1/2 years of civil war.
Russia and Iran have supported Assad's forces during the Syrian conflict while Turkey has backed Syrian rebels fighting Assad.
Russian and Syrian army jets have been targeting civilian convoys trying to flee the Idlib city of Maarat al-Numan, leaving hundreds of families still trapped there, activists and aid groups have said.
""It's a tragic situation for civilians remaining in the city since Russian jets are hitting any convoy that leaves the city, while those who were able to reach areas closer to the border have nowhere to shelter,"" said Mohamad Rasheed, an activist in the area.
LIBYA ALSO IN FOCUS
The Syrian army said on Monday it had fought fierce battles in southeastern Idlib and seized several villages after killing large numbers of what it called terrorists.
""People are lying on the ground sleeping in the open with no blankets and under rain and cold,"" said Feras Saad, who fled the city with his family and found shelter in the border village of Harabosh.
Moscow and Damascus both deny allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and say they are fighting al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants.
A Turkish diplomatic source said the delegation in Russia will also discuss Turkey's potential troop deployment and military support to Libya, after Ankara and Tripoli signed a military cooperation accord last month.
Russia has said it is concerned about any such deployment.
Erdogan said on Sunday Turkey could increase military support to Fayez al-Serraj's U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been fighting off an offensive by east Libya forces led by Khalifa Haftar.
Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have backed Haftar's forces.

Later on Monday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu held a phone call with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss developments in Syria and Libya. It did not give further details.

Philip was taken to hospital as a precaution for treatment of an existing condition, Buckingham Palace said last week.
Asked by reporters about his father as he visited flood-hit parts of northern England, heir-to-the-throne Charles said: ""He's all right - once you get to that age, things don't work as well. He's being looked after very well in hospital.""

Since taking power in 2015 the Law and Justice (PiS) party has been in conflict with the European Union over reforms which critics say undermine judicial independence. The suspension of Judge Pawel Juszczyszyn brought the issue back to the fore.
Juszczyszyn, a judge in Olsztyn, eastern Poland, was abruptly suspended when he questioned the appointment of a judge by a body called KRS under rules introduced by PiS. The Supreme Court has said KRS is not independent.
""According to the Supreme Court there are no grounds to keep Judge Juszczyszyn suspended,"" Judge Adam Roch of the Supreme Court's disciplinary chamber told a session.
In early December thousands of protesters poured onto the streets in towns and cities around Poland in support of Juszczyszyn. Nobel prize-winning author Olga Tokarczuk was among those urging Poles to protest.
The case illustrates a broader issue the Polish justice system faces after the PiS reforms - the threat of chaos, as judges themselves start to question the legality of colleagues appointed by the KRS.
The government has justified its far-reaching reforms - including how judges are appointed - by saying they are necessary to improve the efficiency of the courts and to root out the vestiges of the 1945-89 communist era.
Critics say the PiS reforms are aimed at tightening the government's grip over the justice system and that court cases last now 1-2 months longer than in 2015, when PiS took power."

Deputy Chief of Mission Bart Gorman made the pre-Christmas appeal to Russia outside a Moscow prison after he and diplomats from Britain, Canada and Ireland had visited Whelan.
Whelan, who holds U.S., British, Canadian and Irish passports, was detained by agents from Russia's Federal Security Service in a Moscow hotel room on Dec. 28 last year.
Moscow says Whelan was caught red-handed with a computer flash drive containing classified information. Whelan says he was set up in a sting and had thought the drive, given to him by a Russian acquaintance, contained holiday photos.
He has been held in pre-trial detention while investigators look into his case. 
Gorman urged Russia to allow an outside doctor to examine Whelan, who has a medical condition, and for the former Marine to be allowed to phone his parents, something he has so far been denied. 

""In a case where there is no evidence and no crime it's time to have him released,"" Gorman said.

Disagreement among the Bosnian presidency's Serb, Croat and Bosniak members on how to proceed toward NATO integration had blocked the formation of a new government since a national election in the ethnically divided Balkan nation last year.
But after a compromise between the ethnic groups last month, parliament approved Bosnian Serb economist Zoran Tegeltija as prime minister on Dec. 5. Tegeltija had previously served as finance minister in Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic
On Monday parliament approved Tegeltija's proposed new cabinet team by 29 votes in the 42-seat parliament. The prime minister made no statement after the vote.
Tegeltija, from the Bosnian Serb ruling SNSD party, was nominated by SNSD chief Milorad Dodik, who also serves as a Serb member on Bosnia's tripartite presidency, in exchange for a reform program demanded by NATO, previously blocked by the Serbs who oppose closer ties with the alliance.
His cabinet will include nine ministers from the three biggest ethnic parties - the SNSD, the Croats' HDZ and the Bosniaks' SDA - and two ministers from the SDA's junior partners, the SBB and the DF.
A minister for human rights and refugees has yet to be approved because of procedural delays, Tegeltija said.
After the 1992-95 war that destroyed the old Yugoslavia, Bosnia was split into two autonomous regions linked by a weak central government: the Serb Republic and the Federation, dominated by Bosniak Muslims and Croats. The latter has yet to form a new government.
Tegeltija has said his key priority will be to unblock reforms needed for Bosnia to secure the status of a candidate for eventual European Union membership, and also to release frozen investments to spur much-needed economic growth.
Bosnia lags its Balkan neighbors in the race to join the EU, due partly to its unwieldy political structures and lack of a strong central administration.
Bosnia signed a 553 million euro ($612.7 million) loan deal with the IMF in 2016 but it was frozen in 2018 over stalled economic reforms. ($1 = 0.9025 euros)"

Iranian state media said technicians switched on a secondary circuit at Arak, a plant built to produce the heavy water used as a moderator to slow down reactions in the core of nuclear reactors.
""Today we are ... starting a noteworthy section of the reactor,"" the head of Iran's atomic agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, said in remarks broadcast live on state TV.
Tehran has been reactivating parts of its nuclear program in protest at the United States' withdrawal last year from an international deal meant to limit the Islamic Republic's ability to develop a nuclear bomb.
Washington says its withdrawal and decision to reimpose sanctions lifted under the 2015 deal will force Iran to agree a broader pact. 
Tehran has always said its nuclear work is for power generation, medical work and other peaceful purposes.
The secondary circuit was turned on as Iran worked on a modernization of the Arak plant, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.
JAPAN WILLING
""The Arak heavy water nuclear reactor ... consists of two circuits,"" Mehr said.
""The first circuit is tasked with removing heat from the heart of the reactor, and the secondary circuit is responsible for transferring the heat from the first circuit to cooling towers and finally to the outside environment,"" Mehr added.
Iran agreed to shut down the reactor at Arak, - about 250 km southwest of Tehran - under the 2015 deal. The foreign powers that signed the pact said the plant could eventually have produced plutonium, which can also be used in atom bombs.
But Iran was allowed to produce a limited amount of heavy water and Tehran has been working on redesigning the reactor. Tehran says it will make isotopes for medical and agricultural use.
The control room of the reactor, named Khondab, will take about five to six months to build and the remaining systems will be completed in about one year, Salehi told a news conference at the site. 
The reactor will be ready for initial tests in the Iranian calendar year which will begin in March 2021, Salehi added.
Referring to President Hassan Rouhani's visit to Japan last week, Salehi said Tokyo was willing to mediate between Tehran and Washington.

He said discussions between Iran, Japan and other countries had included a proposal for Tehran to give assurances that it was not seeking nuclear arms by re-issuing a fatwa issued in the early 2000s by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that bans the development or use of nuclear weapons.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday opened a rail route linking Russia's two biggest cities to Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and said it proved that the country could deliver on giant infrastructure projects. 
Putin inaugurated the passenger service by personally taking a train across the road and rail bridge which Russian engineers built to link Crimea to southern Russia after an earlier pre-annexation route which ran through Ukraine was shut down. 
""With your work, talent, determination and single-mindedness, you've shown that Russia is able to do such world-scale infrastructure projects. This is after all the longest bridge not only in Russia but also in Europe,"" Putin told a crowd of construction workers. 
""And you've shown that we can do such large-scale projects using our own technological abilities. This, without exaggeration, gives us all confidence that we can and definitely will do similar projects in the future.""
European Union sanctions ban European citizens and companies from investing in Crimea, including in the peninsula's transport and infrastructure, something which complicated Russia's drive to build the 212-billion-rouble ($3.4 billion) bridge. 
Construction of the bridge, which is 19 km long (11.8 miles), was opposed by Ukraine, which says it wants the Black Sea peninsula back. The Kremlin has ruled out returning Crimea.
The bridge, likely to be viewed as an important part of Putin's legacy, was designed to integrate Crimea into Russia's economy and to end its relative isolation by allowing Russia to supply it by road and rail as well as by sea and air.
Putin said the new rail route would carry around 14 million passengers and about 13 million tonnes of freight next year. 
HOLIDAY DESTINATION
Russian state television has likened the bridge to a multi-billion-dollar railway project under Communist leader Leonid Brezhnev which linked Siberia to the Soviet far east.
The first passenger train carrying 530 people left St Petersburg on Monday afternoon as Putin watched via video link from a location near the bridge in Russia's Krasnodar region.
The passenger service from Moscow is due to start on Tuesday, while freight and passenger services from other Russian cities are due to commence next year. 
Russia has relentlessly promoted Crimea, a favored holiday destination in the Soviet era, as an attractive place for Russians to soak up the sun. 
The contract to build the bridge was handed to Arkady Rotenberg, Putin's childhood judo partner, who controlled the lead contractor. He accompanied Putin on Monday.

About 60 attackers descended on the group of around 40 protesters outside the government's National Human Rights Commission in the capital Abuja, sending them running for safety.
The protesters were planning to deliver a list of demands to the Commission, including the release of prisoners such as activist Omoyele Sowore, founder of Sahara Reporters, an online news organization.

The newspaper said the message urged whoever received it to contact Peter Humphrey, a British former journalist and corporate fraud investigator who was imprisoned in the same jail from 2014-2015.
Tesco suspended the Chinese supplier of the Christmas cards on Sunday and said it had launched an investigation. 
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a press briefing on Monday: ""I can responsibly say, according to the relevant organs, Shanghai's Qingpu prison does not have this issue of foreign prisoners being forced to work."" 
Geng Shuang dismissed the whole story as ""a farce created by Mr. Humphrey"" - an accusation dismissed by Humphrey.
""I never had any possible way to fabricate anything at all in this incident and this story,"" Humphrey told Reuters. ""This message from prisoners in China came in a Christmas card purchased by a family who I've never met, never known until that moment in time,"" he added. 
Humphrey said the message fitted ""with everything I know, and I have spoken with ex-prisoners who were released this year and who confirmed that prison unit was making packaging for Tesco Christmas cards.""
Humphrey spent 23 months in prison on charges of illegally obtaining private records of Chinese citizens and selling the information to clients including drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.
Humphrey said during his trial he had not thought his activities in China were illegal.

The Sunday Times said the message had been found in London by six-year-old Florence Widdicombe who showed it to her father. He then contacted Humphrey via LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).

Power was lost shortly after 8am (0700 GMT) and began being restored in parts of the island shortly after 11am.
Another recent power outage, on Nov. 26, was also caused by a fault in the Sicily-to-Malta undersea cable.
Malta's own power stations have enough capacity to meet demand, but Enemalta usually relies on most of its supply from Sicily because it is cheaper. Turning on power generators when the undersea cable fails takes several hours.
The latest blackout, two days before Christmas, left shopkeepers unable to operate credit card machines and, in some cases, they were not even able to open their shop shutters. Malta airport said it was operating normally, using generators."

YANGON (Reuters) - Hundreds of people joined a protest on Monday against Myanmar’s police after the force broke the law by revealing the name of the child victim of a high profile rape case following the acquittal of a suspect.
The case of the three-year-old girl - known to the public by the nickname 'Victoria' - has become a focus for accusations of police misconduct in Myanmar, where the force remains under the control of the army under a transition to democracy.
Lawyers and journalists had tried hard during the trial to conceal the identity of the child and her family to protect their right to privacy. 
Around 400 people holding the signs of ""Shame on you Myanmar Police Force"" and ""Justice for Victoria"" marched through the center of Yangon under a hot sun.
The child was allegedly raped at a nursery school in Myanmar’s capital, Naypyidaw, in May.
After a court ruled that a suspect arrested in the case was not guilty, police announced the name of the victim.
A police spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on the accusations of misconduct against the force.
A democratically elected government led by Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi took power in Myanmar in 2015, but key institutions such as the police remain under military control and efforts to strengthen the rule of law have floundered.
Prominent lawyer Kyee Myint told protesters that the constitution should be changed to bring the police under government control.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - More than 1,000 protesters, many in surgical masks and balaclavas, filled a harborside plaza near Hong Kong's financial district late on Monday to demand full democracy and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.
As Hong Kong gears up for Christmas celebrations, the protesters plan wildcat gatherings in prime shopping malls and a 'silent night' rally on Tuesday evening.
The demonstrators gathered at the harborside on Monday sang ""Glory to Hong Kong"", a protest anthem, and shone lights from their mobile phones.
Henry, a 28-year-old banker, said he was in the plaza to protest a recent police shutdown of Spark Alliance, a fund-raising platform for protesters. He wore a Guy Fawkes mask from the movie ""V for Vendetta"", which glowed green in the dark. 
""The Hong Kong government is ruining our reputation as a financial center. How can they say we are a place for finance if they can shut down the fund so unreasonably?"" he said.
The protests, now in their seventh month, have lost some of the scale and intensity of earlier confrontations. Police have arrested more than 6,000 people since the protests escalated in June, including more than 52 over the past weekend. 
Many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as Beijing's meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering and says it is committed to the 'one country, two systems' formula put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest. 
MALL PROTESTS
On Sunday, a peaceful protest ended in clashes when black-clad, masked demonstrators attacked police with kicks and punches and threw bricks and bottles. Police responded with bursts of pepper spray. One officer drew his pistol and pointed it towards a crowd but didn't fire, Reuters witnesses said.
Protesters plan to gather in five malls on Christmas Eve and will count down to Christmas near the harbor front in the bustling Tsim Sha Tsui district, social media posts say. More protests are planned for Christmas Day on Wednesday.
The Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized some of the biggest marches involving more than a million people, has also applied to stage another march on New Year's Day.
Some people taking part in Sunday's protest called for Hong Kong's independence from China and removed a Chinese flag from its pole, drawing condemnation from the government.
Both the Beijing and Hong Kong governments have made clear such separatist rhetoric will not be tolerated.
""Advocating Hong Kong independence ... is not conducive to the overall and long-term interest of Hong Kong society. It is also contrary to the established basic policies of the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong,"" the city government said in a statement overnight.
While police, including the leader of a major police union, have referred to the protesters as cockroaches, protesters routinely call the police dogs. 
On Monday, public broadcaster RTHK broadcast a video of a police public relations officer playing down the significance of the term cockroach.

The officer said the term should not be ""over-interpreted"" because while it may be negative, another way to understand it was that cockroaches were ""full of vitality"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi contradicted his closest lieutenant over plans for a nationwide register as he tried to defuse protests against a citizenship law in which at least 21 people have been killed.
Modi's Hindu-nationalist government says the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which became law on Dec. 11, is needed to give persecuted non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who fled to India before 2015 a pathway to citizenship.
But many Indians feel the law discriminates against Muslims and violates India's secular constitution by making religion a test for citizenship. They say the law and a proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) could be used to reduce Muslims to second-class citizens.
""I must assure Muslim citizens of India that this law will not change anything for them,"" Modi said on Sunday at a rally in New Delhi, trying to stave off the biggest challenge to his leadership since he first swept to power in 2014. His government did not have a religious bias when introducing reforms, he added.
Modi also said that there had been no discussion on creating the nationwide register of citizens - directly contradicting key ally Home (Interior) Minister Amit Shah.
""Since my government has come to power, since 2014 to now, I want to tell (1.3 billion) citizens, there has been no discussion on even the word NRC,"" Modi told a crowd of thousands.
But speaking in parliament last month, Shah told lawmakers unequivocally that the government would introduce a nationwide register.
In April, he laid out the chronology for the process, telling reporters: ""First, there will be a Citizenship Amendment Bill ... after that, there will an NRC.""
In June, after Modi's party was returned to power with a thumping majority, President Ram Nath Kovind also told parliament that the register would be on the government's agenda.
Shah was appointed president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shortly after Modi's election win in 2014, a post he still holds. Modi named him to the powerful home ministry after he was re-elected this year.
""Just who are you calling a LIAR, PM?"" wrote The Telegraph newspaper in a front page headline on Monday. Below, it highlighted comments by all three, asking: ""Who's saying the truth?""
The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to questions on the matter.
""HIGHLY UNLIKELY""
Neelanjan Sircar, a professor at Ashoka University near New Delhi, said the ruling party was likely trying to confuse the issue with the electorate to beat back growing opposition.
""Is it credible that Amit Shah and Narendra Modi are not on the same page on something this important, on something that has taken up the headlines and caused protests the way it has? It just seems highly unlikely,"" Sircar said.
In his speech on Sunday, Modi also blamed the Congress party and other opposition groups for spreading rumors that there were detention centers for illegal immigrants in India.
""It's a lie, it's a lie, it's a lie,"" the prime minister said.
In July, the government informed parliament about guidelines for detention centers, including construction of basic amenities like electricity, drinking water, accommodation and toilets with running water.
Reuters visited an under-construction detention center in India's northeast in September.
So far, the citizens' register has been restricted to the northeastern state of Assam, where it has been implemented under orders from the Supreme Court.
After officials vetted documents submitted by about 33 million people, 1.9 million people were excluded from the citizens' list. Several hundred people unable to prove their citizenship are already in detention camps.
Many Indian Muslims see Assam as an example of what a nationwide exercise might mean for them, despite Modi's insistence that there is no immediate plan for a nationwide register.
Mohammed Naeem, who joined a demonstration against the citizenship bill and the register in New Delhi hours after Modi's speech on Sunday, said he was still fearful.
""The prime minister might say there is nothing to fear but do you see what is happening in Assam?"" he said, walking amid protesters, joined by his wife and three young children.
""People are being forcefully evicted from their houses, detained."""

Children dressed as Santa Claus sang carols and rang bells during a Christmas-themed show at the College des Freres, which sits in the biblical city's central market where holiday decorations and wooden nativity scenes line the narrow alleys.
The main attractions in Bethlehem are the 4th-century Church of the Nativity, built over a grotto where Christian tradition says Jesus was born, and the 16-metre (52-foot) Christmas tree in Manger Square.
On Tuesday - Christmas Eve - the acting Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, will lead a procession from Jerusalem to nearby Bethlehem and later celebrate Midnight Mass in the Church of the Nativity, squeezing through its narrow sandstone entrance.
Bethlehem's Christmas season lasts through the Eastern Orthodox celebration on Jan. 7 to Armenian Christmas on Jan. 18.
The season offers measured cheer for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank city, which is separated from nearby Jerusalem by a towering Israeli concrete military barrier.
Bethlehem is enjoying its busiest tourist year in two decades, with foreign pilgrims coming in large numbers, taking advantage of a relative lull in Israeli-Palestinian tension.
Israel said on Sunday it would allow Christians in the Palestinian Gaza Strip to visit Bethlehem and Jerusalem at Christmas, reversing an earlier decision not to issue them permits."

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's Electoral Complaints Commission said on Monday the election might go to a second round as it begins reviewing thousands of complaints a day after the preliminary result handed incumbent president Ashraf Ghani a narrow victory.
The Independent Election Commission (IEC) announced on Sunday a much delayed preliminary result of the Sept. 28 presidential vote which was marred by allegations of massive fraud, technical problems with biometric devices used for voting, attacks and irregularities.
IEC said the total turnout was over 1.8 million with Ghani securing 50.64 percent to win the first round of voting, beating his main rival Abdullah Abdullah who currently shares power with him in a unity government.
However, if a review by the complaints commission reduces Ghani's vote share to below 50 percent and no other candidate has a majority, a second round will be held between the two top contenders.
Deen Mohammad Azimi, deputy head of the Electoral Complaints Commission, said there is a ""strong possibility"" the election would go to the second round.
""Looking at the scope of complaints and objections that needs a thorough review, there could be a run-off,"" Azimi told Reuters.
The review might take around five weeks, Azimi said, adding that thousands of complaints from candidates had already been filed.
According to the tally released by IEC, the total turnout was 1,824,401 with Ghani winning 923,868 votes and Abdullah second with 720,099 (39.52 percent).
""President Ghani avoided a run-off just by over 11,000 votes and the complaints commission might invalidate tens of thousands of votes from all candidates,"" another election official said on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the media.
Ghani welcomed the IEC decision and said the country was on the right path towards prosperity but Abdullah dismissed the result as fraudulent as he called for a full review.
""There is not doubt that based on clean votes, we are the winner,"" Abdullah told a crowd of supporters on Sunday in Kabul.
The situation echoes 2014, when both Ghani and Abdullah alleged massive fraud by the other, forcing the United States to broker an awkward power-sharing arrangement that made Ghani president and Abdullah his chief executive.
Aides close to Ghani, a Western-educated former World Bank official, said the incumbent was not ready for another power-sharing deal with Abdullah, a former medical doctor and three-time contender for the presidency.
Without a unifying leader accepted by all sides, Afghanistan could split further along tribal and ethnic lines which could deepen political instability.
Although Abdullah called for restraint, election result announcements in Afghanistan are typically followed by violent protests from supporters of losing candidates."

French TV station BFM showed footage of riot police tangling with around 30 protesters at the Gare de Lyon, one of the French capital's busiest stations and often used for travel to ski resorts in the Alps.
Protesters let off flares and fireworks, releasing smoke that drifted down into the station concourse.
The walkouts, which have disrupted Christmas preparations, have also affected other main Paris stations such as the Gare du Nord, which handles the Eurostar services to London and Brussels, and the Gare de l'Est.
""I understand (the strike) but I am not OK with it as I think all French people are being held hostage and it is difficult for us to understand what the goal is,"" said Damien Dremont, a commuter at the Gare de L'Est.
Two weeks of nationwide industrial action against Macron's pension reform, which would scrap special pensions for many public sector staff and make people work to 64 to draw a full pension, have crippled France's transport network.
France's oil sector workers are also expected to vote in favor of shutting down oil refineries as part of the protest.

In a bid to defuse the public anger, Macron over the weekend decided to forego a special presidential pension payout when he eventually steps down.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The number of Syrians fleeing attacks in the country's northwestern Idlib province and heading toward Turkey has reached 120,000, a Turkish aid group said on Monday, adding it was setting up a camp for some of those uprooted.
Syrian and Russian forces have recently intensified their bombardment of targets in Idlib, which Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to recapture, prompting a wave of refugees toward Turkey.
President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday Turkey cannot handle a fresh wave of migrants, warning that European countries will feel the impact of such an influx if violence in Syria's northwest is not stopped.
""In the last week, the number of people fleeing from the southern regions (of Idlib) to the north because of the increasing attacks has reached 120,000,"" said Selim Tosun, the Humanitarian Relief Foundation's (IHH) media advisor in Syria.
Erdogan said on Sunday 80,000 people were currently on the move. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said 40,000 civilians had been displaced since Thursday, the start of the latest military operation.
Many of the migrants fled the city of Maraat al-Numan, with some going to camps near the Turkish border, while others have gone to stay with relatives or to the areas of Afrin and Azaz near the Turkish border, the IHH's Tosun said.
The IHH said it had begun distributing 20,000 packages of food prepared for the migrants between the city of Idlib and the town of Sarmada. It was also preparing a tent camp in the area of Killi, a village some 13 km (8 miles) from the Turkish border.
Tosun said the camp for families will have 500 tents and can expand.
Turkey currently hosts some 3.7 million displaced Syrians, the largest refugee population in the world, after 8-1/2 years of civil war in Syria. Ankara fears another wave from the Idlib region, where up to 3 million Syrians live in the last significant rebel-held swathe of territory.
A Turkish delegation was traveling to Moscow on Monday for talks which were expected to focus in part on Syria and which Erdogan had said would determine Turkey's course of action in the region.
Turkey has backed Syrian rebels fighting to oust Assad in the war, while Russia and Iran support Assad's forces."

BEIJING (Reuters) - It is ""more important than anything"" to keep up the momentum for talks between the United States and North Korea, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Monday.
North Korea has set a year-end deadline for the United States to change what it says is a policy of hostility amid a stalemate in efforts to make progress on their pledge to end the North's nuclear program and establish lasting peace.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since June 2018, but there has been no substantive progress in dialogue while the North demanded crushing international sanctions be lifted first.
On Saturday, state media said the United States would ""pay dearly"" for taking issue with the North's human rights record and said Washington's ""malicious words"" would only aggravate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
China is North Korea's most important diplomatic backer and trading partner, and Moon took his message about the significance of talks straight to Xi.
""It is more important than anything to keep up the momentum for dialogue between North Korea and the United States,"" Moon said, according to his spokeswoman Ko Min-jung who was present at the meeting in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
Ko cited Xi as saying that many people are concerned about the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. 
""China and South Korea should gather strength to help North Korea and the United States sustain the momentum for dialogue,"" she cited Xi as saying. 
Earlier, Moon's office quoted him as saying that the suspension of U.S.-North Korea talks and rising tensions was not beneficial for South Korea, China or North Korea.
NEW IMPETUS
Xi told Moon that China supports South Korea's efforts to improve ties with North Korea and inject new impetus into promoting peace talks, China's Foreign Ministry said.
China and South Korea both advocate that the Korean peninsula issue be resolved through dialogue and consultation and are a ""firm force for maintaining stability and promoting talks"", the ministry paraphrased Xi as saying.
Moon is visiting China for a trilateral meeting between him, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in the southwestern city of Chengdu.
Though various economic matters will also be on the agenda - as well as tensions between Seoul and Tokyo - North Korea appears likely to dominate the agenda.
U.S. special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun met with two senior Chinese diplomats during his two-day visit to Beijing last week, following similar meeting in South Korea and Japan days earlier, as diplomats make last-ditch attempts to prevent new confrontation.
Beijing, jointly with Russia, proposed last week that the United Nations Security Council lift some sanctions in what it calls an attempt to break the current deadlock and seek to build support.
But it's unclear whether Beijing can convince Seoul and Tokyo to break ranks from Washington, which has made its opposition clear and can veto any resolution.
Though South Korea sees China as instrumental in reviving negotiations, it has so far sidestepped questions on whether it supports the new proposal by Beijing and Moscow.
For its part, Japan has historically been a staunch supporter of sanctions against North Korea.
Japan Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoki Okada, speaking to reporters after Abe held his own meeting with Xi in Beijing, said Xi had asked Japan to support the joint Chinese-Russian proposal.

But Japan considers easing sanctions on North Korea ""still premature"", Okada said.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's powerful army chief Lieutenant-General Ahmed Gaed Salah, who was instrumental in bringing down long-time president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has died, state media reported on Monday.
The 79-year-old's death comes at a time of mass protests across Africa's largest country as people demand that the ruling elite quits power and that the influential military steps back from politics.
Gaed Salah's departure may not signify major changes to Algeria's economic and political policies, however, as he had plenty of potential successors in a military that has remained united over the handling of the protests.
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune announced that the head of land forces, General Said Chengriha, would take over as acting chief of staff of the armed forces. 
The army's prominent role was underlined last week at Tebboune's inauguration, during which he embraced Gaed Salah and presented him with an order of merit immediately after his own swearing in. 
Soon after mass protests erupted early this year, Gaed Salah's televised speech urging president Bouteflika to quit led to the veteran leader's swift resignation. 
The army then backed a series of arrests of Bouteflika allies and senior businessmen in an anti-corruption campaign that was widely seen as a purge of the military's rivals within the ruling system.
But it was not enough to appease ordinary Algerians, many of whom had begun calling for Gaed Salah's resignation and for the military to step away from the running of the major natural gas exporter. 

One constant chant throughout the protests has been for ""A civilian state, not a military state"".

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Thousands of Indians have been protesting against a new citizenship law as well as possible plans for a National Register of Citizens (NRC), alleging the measures are an attack on a secular constitution and against minority Muslims.
The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) aims to fast-track citizenship for persecuted Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians who arrived in India before Dec. 31, 2014, from Muslim-majority Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
The passing of the bill on Dec. 11 triggered widespread demonstrations in the eastern state of Assam, as protesters feared it would convert thousands of illegal migrants from neighboring Muslim-majority Bangladesh into legal residents.
Elsewhere in India, protesters say the citizenship law will be followed by the national register, which they fear is designed by the Hindu-nationalist government to expel Muslims who do not have sufficient citizenship documentation.
The government has refuted those allegations and vowed to protect all citizens equally.
WHY IS THE CITIZENSHIP ACT CONTROVERSIAL?
Under the law, India will grant citizenship to the six communities that Modi's government says have historically faced persecution in the three Muslim-dominated neighbors. The government says Muslims cannot be treated as persecuted minorities in those countries.
Critics say the law discriminates against Muslims and undermines India's secular constitution. They question why the law does not include Muslims fleeing Sri Lanka and Myanmar, which are majority Buddhist.
WHAT IS THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF CITIZENS?
Authorities in the northeastern state of Assam began using the NRC to identify illegal immigrants in 2015, on the orders of the Supreme Court. It was only meant to be used for the ethnically-diverse region but since then, there have been calls from officials of the ruling party and its supporters for its nationwide implementation.
A final list of citizens in Assam, published on Aug. 31, excluded nearly 1.9 million residents, most of them Muslim but including some Hindus.
WHAT WOULD A PAN-INDIA NRC LOOK LIKE?
The 2019 manifesto of Modi's ruling Bharatia Janata Party (BJP) said ""in future we will implement the NRC in a phased manner in other parts of the country"" but did not provide details.
If a nationwide NRC is enacted, activists and opposition politicians expect that residents unable to prove citizenship would be taken to detention centers, as is happening in Assam.
Most of India's 1.3 billion people are Hindu, about 14% are Muslim and the rest are Christians, Buddhists and others.
In Assam, excluded people were given 120 days to prove their citizenship at quasi-judicial bodies known as Foreigners Tribunals. Those deemed to be illegal immigrants can appeal to higher courts.
MODI'S LAWS
Religious minorities and liberals are growing increasingly uneasy with Modi's Hindu agenda, which appears to have gained emphasis since his re-election in May.
The citizenship bill comes after a November Supreme Court decision that handed Hindu groups control of a contested site where a 16th-century mosque was razed by Hindu zealots in 1992, paving the way for the construction of a temple there, as long promised by the BJP.
That followed a government decision in August to strip Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir state of its special status and split it into two federally administered regions in what the government said was a bid to integrate the restive region with the rest of India.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
The CAA has been challenged in the Supreme Court by a Muslim political party, lawyers and rights groups on the grounds that it violates the secular constitution.
No date has been set for a hearing.
On Sunday, Modi said his government had no immediate plans for a countrywide NRC, but his comments contradicted statements by his closest lieutenant, Home Minister Amit Shah. Government officials have not clarified the position."

YANDERRA, Australia (Reuters) - It was oppressively hot, above 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), and the wind was picking up. Bushfires were devastating nearby towns and now threatened Yanderra, a small village with just over 600 people located south of Sydney. 
Diane and Ron Baxter (NYSE:BAX) bought a block of land here 43 years ago. They'd since built a house and a life, raising two children including a daughter now living next door with her family.
As smoke filled the sky on Saturday and fire embers fell nearby, the Baxters, aged in their 70s, chose to remain and defend their property, rather than doing what their family wanted them to do - leave.
""We left our run a little bit too late to get out and the roads were blocked, but we felt we needed to stay and protect the house anyway,"" Diane Baxter told Reuters at her home.
""We just feel at this time in our life we needed to stay with our home,"" she said, adding she and her husband couldn't face having to rebuild their lives. 
""It would be very hard to start over again, very hard.""
Fire is a pervasive danger in Australia, but many people choose to stay to defend their properties at considerable risk.
By patrolling their homes, people can put out sparks and embers before they take hold as they likely would in a building left vacant.
But this fire season is proving to be particularly dangerous. On Saturday, fires swept through the town of Balmoral, located just a couple of kilometers from Yanderra, prompting New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian to declare there was ""not much left"". 
During the past couple of months, more than 900 homes have been lost across the dry continent, according to authorities, even though the southern hemisphere summer has not yet reached its mid-point. At least six people have died.
Authorities understand some people will want to defend their homes and they have developed check-lists which include having protective clothing and making sure a home is adequately prepared and free of flammable debris.
""You have to physically and mentally be able to withstand the onslaught of a fire,"" New South Wales Rural Fire Service liaison officer Elizabeth Ellis told Reuters.
""And everybody in the household has to be prepared to do that. Because the worst thing you can do is tail run for it at the last minute.""
The scorching heat from the weekend has subsided, and authorities are using the cooler conditions to strengthen fire containment lines ahead of the next wave of heat, forecast for late in the week.
Matthew Doyle, from the nearby town of Bargo, left his and his partner's new home on Saturday as the heat intensified and fire approached.
He said that while his ""gut feeling"" was that he should protect his house, he decided it wasn't worth the risk. 
A last-minute shift in the wind direction saved the house, but Doyle stood by his decision.

""You can replace everything, except for your lives,"" he said.

South Korean and U.S. commandos raided the facility and led out a man with his hands tied behind the back during the exercise described as a joint regular close-quarters battle training last month at a U.S. military base in the southwestern South Korean city of Gunsan.

The service is operated by an arm of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper, which first reported the training, said the drills were intended to simulate a scenario to capture North Korean executives.
Screenshots of what it said was a now deleted video from the Pentagon showed a man in military uniforms akin to that of North Korea collapse upon a gunshot from one of the commandos, Chosun Ilbo said. 
Pyongyang has in the past accused the United States and South Korea of seeking to topple its regime with ""hostile policy"", while slamming their regular joint military exercises as plots to ""decapitate"" its leadership and a rehearsal for war. 
South Korea under a previous administration had planned to launch a special unit in 2017 tasked with ""removing or paralyzing"" North Korea's top command in the event of a war. 
Tension has been growing in recent weeks as North Korea conducts a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with U.S. President Donald Trump in an apparent bid to underscore its year-end deadline. 
Earlier this month, Trump said the United States reserved the right to use military force against North Korea.

General Charles Brown, commander of U.S. Pacific Air Forces, said last week the U.S. military could ""dust off pretty quickly and be ready to use"" options it had developed during the height of tensions in 2017.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean heiress known for delaying a Korean Air Lines flight in 2014 because she was angry at the way she was served nuts has accused her younger brother of disobeying their late father's will to manage the airline's parent company together.
Heather Cho, a former Korean Air Lines executive whose ""nut rage"" incident made international headlines, said her younger brother was ignoring the wishes of their father, late chairman Cho Yang-ho, for ""harmony"" in the family's management of Korean Air parent Hanjin Group.
Brother Cho Won-tae, who was named chairman of Hanjin Group in April and is also chief executive officer of Korean Air, had been making management decisions without prior consultations, according to a statement issued by Heather Cho's lawyers on Monday. 
""Without real consent and enough discussions among inheritors, Cho Won-tae was appointed to represent Hanjin Group,"" it said.
""The late chairman had asked the family to lead Hanjin Group with harmony ... yet chairman Cho Won-tae has been making management decisions not aligned with (the late chairman's) will, and is still being insincere when it comes to family discussions regarding the management of the group.""
The statement added that Heather ""intends to listen to the views of various shareholders and hold consultations with them to actively pursue Hanjin Group's development in accordance with the late chairman's will"".
Analysts said the statement raised the possibility that Heather Cho could try to join hands with other investors to raise their stakes in group holding company Hanjin Kal.
Hanjin Kal shares soared 20% on Monday, while the broader Korean market closed flat. Korean Air and budget affiliate Jin Air also rose over 4%.
Cho Won-tae, Heather Cho and younger sister Emily Cho hold 6.46%, 6.43% and 6.42% of Hanjin Kal shares respectively.
""We hope that this incident will not hurt the stability of the company's management or have a negative impact on the company's value,"" Hanjin Group said in a statement. 
Heather Cho and Emily Cho stepped down from their positions at Korean Air in April last year, amid public outrage at their behavior. 
Days earlier, police had launched an investigation into Emily Cho after she threw a drink at two business meeting attendees. She apologized for her ""foolish behavior"" and was later cleared of any charges. 
Heather Cho made global headlines in 2014 when she lost her temper over the way she was served nuts in first class and ordered the Korean Air flight to return to its gate at a New York airport. 

A year before he died, late chairman Cho Yang-ho apologized for his daughters' missteps and promised the company would ""turn over a new leaf"" with stronger management led by the board.

BEIJING (Reuters) - An unmarried Chinese woman filed a suit against a hospital on Monday for rejecting her request to undergo a medical procedure to freeze her eggs due to her marital status, in China's first legal challenge of a woman fighting for her reproductive rights. 
According to China's laws on human assisted reproduction, only married couples can use such health services, and they must be able to prove their marital status by showing a marriage license. 
Teresa Xu, 31, visited the Beijing Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital at Capital Medical University in November 2018, wanting to freeze her eggs while she focused on her career as a writer on gender issues. 
A woman's eggs deteriorate in quality as she ages, presenting obstacles to conception among older women. Through a medical procedure, a woman's eggs can be removed from her ovaries and frozen for use at a later time. 
Xu, from northeastern Heilongjiang province, said on her first visit to the hospital for a checkup, the doctor asked about her marital status and urged her to have a child now instead of freezing her eggs. 
Upon her second visit, the doctor told her she could not proceed any further. 
""I came here for a professional service, but instead I got someone who was urging me to put aside my work and to have a child first,"" she said. ""I have already received a lot of this pressure in this society, this culture.""
When asked by Reuters to comment, the hospital declined, saying it could not speak to international media. 
China's rapid economic growth has created the conditions for single women to become financially independent, but the country's policies and medical industry have not necessarily kept pace.
""This is a systemic issue, because the system has brought this difficult position for single women,"" Xu said. 
She considered illegal clinics. 
The women's bathroom door at the hospital, Xu said, was filled with these ads. 
But ultimately she decided against it.
Those who can afford it have circumvented China's strict laws on fertility by going abroad. Xu said she had made enquiries but found it too expensive. 
Agents told her that a treatment in Thailand would cost about 100,000 yuan ($14,273) and 200,000 yuan if she wanted to undergo the treatment in the United States. 
Xu said her case was expected to go on for several months. 
""I personally feel that being able to arrive at this stage is already a sort of win,"" she said. 
""For me I didn't feel like I was at court as an individual. I felt I was standing there with the weight of many other single women's expectations.""

The case was one of the top trending topics on China's Twitter-like Weibo on Monday and is the food delivery giant's first big public incident since its initial public offering last September in Hong Kong.
China has in recent years experienced a delivery boom powered by millions of couriers who are employed by companies such as Meituan Dianping and Alibaba's Ele.me to deliver millions of packages and meal orders around the country.
While many customers laud such services for their speed and convenience, there has been a growing debate about the treatment of these deliverymen, who work under tight time pressures and lack medical insurance when traffic accidents happen.
Local police in Chinese city of Wuhan published details of the case on Sunday which involved a 32-year-old delivery man, surnamed Chen, who stabbed a supermarket employee.
Meituan said a quarrel broke out between Chen and the supermarket employee when he had gone to the store to pick up goods for delivery. The stabbed employee later died, local police said.
""After collaborating with the police investigating into our system, there was no complaining calls or bad reviews on the vendor or the delivery man,"" Meituan said in a statement on Monday.
""We will shoulder the responsibility, search for the problems and spare no efforts to make improvements to the platform,"" it added.
Comments on Weibo were mixed, with some users speculating what pressures might have driven the deliveryman to commit such a crime while others said there was no justification for such actions.
""Delivery men's job is very toilsome, but it shouldn't be the reason to kidnap me morally,"" one of the most liked Weibo comment about the case read.
""Your work is paid and my money is earned through hard work... You're the only people who need understanding and sympathy?""
Meituan controlled almost two-thirds of China’s food delivery market as of September, according to research firm Trustdata."

The U.S. military said in a statement an American service member was ""killed in action"", but gave no details and withheld the name of the service member until the next of kin were informed.
Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said they killed the U.S. force member in a blast in the northern province of Kunduz. 
""Our fighters killed a U.S. force member and injured an Afghan commando,"" Mujahid said in a text message, which included the photographs.
About 20,000 foreign troops, most of them American, are in Afghanistan as part of a U.S.-led NATO mission to train, assist and advise Afghan forces. Some U.S. forces carry out counter-terrorism operations against Islamist militant groups.
More than a dozen foreign force members have been killed in Afghanistan in 2019. 
The United States has been in negotiations with Taliban militants over the past year on a deal under which the United States could withdraw its forces from its longest war in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.
This month, U.S. negotiators said they would take a break from the talks after the insurgents launched a suicide attack on a large U.S. base.
Afghan government forces, supported by the U.S. military, have recently stepped up operations against the Taliban in Kunduz. 
The Taliban control more territory than at any point since they were ousted from power in 2001.

90,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 01:19AM ET</span>","After Ethiopia crash, victims' relatives say they were hounded by U.S. law firms","By Katharine Houreld
NAIROBI/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Days after the March 10 crash of a Kenya-bound Ethiopian Airlines’ Boeing jet that killed all 157 people on board, strangers began calling or visiting bereaved families, saying they represented U.S. law firms.
They showed up uninvited at memorials and at homes full of weeping relatives. They cold called. They left brochures. In one case a grieving husband was offered money for an appointment. One woman offered counseling and another said she was creating an emotional support group, without disclosing they were working for lawyers.
Reuters interviewed 37 relatives of the victims, or their representatives, and found that 31 complained of inappropriate approaches by those saying they represented U.S. law firms.
In some instances, the behavior may have been illegal or unethical under U.S. laws and rules barring solicitation and deceptive practices, several legal ethics experts said.
Six firms were particularly aggressive in courting prospective clients after the Boeing (N:BA) plane nosedived into an Ethiopian field: Ribbeck Law Chartered and Global Aviation Law Group (GALG) of Chicago; The Witherspoon Law Group and Ramji Law Group from Texas; and Wheeler & Franks Law Firm PC and Eaves Law Firm of Mississippi.
Witherspoon, Wheeler and Eaves denied any wrongdoing. Ribbeck, GALG and Ramji did not respond to requests for comment.
Ribbeck Law and GALG have jointly filed two lawsuits against Boeing seeking “all damages available under the law” without being specific about the size of the claims. Three suits filed by Ramji have been dismissed. The other firms haven’t filed any suits.
By Thursday, there were 114 cases filed against Boeing in Chicago federal court on behalf of 112 crash victims, according to lead counsel for the plaintiffs, Robert Clifford. More than three dozen law firms are representing them. No trial date has been set.
Boeing has said it is “cooperating fully with the investigating authorities” and said that safety is its highest priority.
It has acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on 737 MAX software involved in a Lion Air crash that killed 189 in Indonesia in October 2018 and the Ethiopian crash five months later, but Boeing has not admitted any fault in how it developed the aircraft. The 737 MAX is currently grounded.
Boeing declined to comment on the lawsuits.
UNINVITED GUEST
An uninvited stranger turned up at Paul Njoroge’s family home in Kenya just hours after a memorial service for his wife, his three small children, and his mother-in-law, who all died in the crash.
Njoroge said the visitor gave him promotional materials for the law firm Wheeler and Franks.
""I said, I don't know who directed you to this place. Everyone here is praying,"" Njoroge told Reuters.
Two other families said they received visits around the time of memorial services from Wheeler’s lawyers or people who said they represented the firm.
James Ndeda, who Wheeler represented after he was injured in the 1998 embassy bombing in Kenya, said he visited Njoroge. The firm’s partners, Bill Wheeler and Jamie Franks, asked Ndeda to help the firm connect with crash victims’ families, Ndeda said. Wheeler sent him literature featuring his firm and another Mississippi firm, Eaves Law Firm.
Ndeda said he went to visit victims’ families either by himself, sent employees or accompanied Bill Wheeler or Jamie Franks, and sometimes Leo Jackson, an investigator with Eaves. Jackson declined to comment.
Wheeler and Franks, and Eaves, said in a joint emailed statement they only met families if invited.""The story you have been told is completely wrong,"" they wrote.
""We contacted no families without an invitation.""
They declined to answer further questions.
MANY OVERTURES
Ethiopian Bayihe Demissie, whose flight attendant wife Elsabet was a victim, told Reuters a man who said he was from The Witherspoon Law Group called him three days after the crash. Bayihe said he was too upset to speak.
People saying they represented more than 30 firms contacted him over the next few months, including Witherspoon again, and GALG, said Bayihe. The constant calls about compensation hurt because it felt like people were suggesting he could benefit from his wife’s death, he said.
Witherspoon denied the allegations.
""This firm does not solicit or engage in any illegal practices. We do not represent any of the families involved in the tragic crash,"" Witherspoon’s founder Nuru Witherspoon said in an email.
REJECTED APPROACHES
A woman named Mihret Girma sent a Kenyan victim’s family a message in August, inviting them to attend a meeting with a grief counselor and the Law Society of Kenya.
At that time, she did not reveal she had ties to the firms GALG and Ribbeck, according to the family, who shared messages received from Mihret.
Mihret was in a WhatsApp group with GALG staff and U.S. lawyers Manuel Ribbeck and Monica Ribbeck Kelly within three weeks of the March crash, other messages reviewed by Reuters show. Dozens of the messages show GALG staff and the Ribbecks discussing how to reach bereaved families.
Mihret did not return calls or messages seeking comment.
The Illinois state disciplinary commission censured Monica Ribbeck in 2014 for filing an aviation accident suit on behalf of someone who had already terminated her.
In 2015, the commission’s hearing board recommended she be suspended for 60 days for filing what it alleged was a frivolous action for legal discovery over the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines’ Flight 370. That was overturned after a review.
This year, the Ribbecks set up a new entity, GALG, according to messages between GALG and the Ribbecks that have been viewed by Reuters. GALG staff directed clients to the Ribbecks, messages and emails shared by several bereaved families show.
GALG set up its website on March 28, only 18 days after the accident, and filed its articles of incorporation in Illinois on April 24.
Amos Mbicha, whose sister and nephew died in the crash, said he helped more than ten law firms, including GALG, connect with bereaved families. He said he stopped working with GALG in October when the firm tried to contact a victim’s relative after he had warned them not to.
Neither Ribbeck nor GALG responded to requests for comment. Monica Ribbeck did not return multiple email and phone messages from Reuters.
While many families interviewed by Reuters say they turned away cold callers, they typically wound up retaining lawyers after doing their own research.
""Not all the lawyers are bad. If we say that, Boeing wins. We needed to find someone to get justice,” said Tom Kabau, a Kenyan lawyer who lost his younger brother George in the crash and whose family has hired Husain Law and Associates and Wisner Law Firm.
POTENTIALLY HUGE FEES
Lawyers representing victims of airline crashes can get millions of dollars in fees if they win or settle cases in U.S. courts, where there can be large payouts.
Awards against an airline are capped if it was not negligent. But there is no limit for manufacturers, making lawsuits against Boeing potentially lucrative.
Plaintiffs' lawyers in these kinds of cases don't usually charge fees up front but take at least 20 percent of any settlement or award. That standard practice is being followed in the Ethiopian crash cases, bereaved families say.
Beyond the aggressive approaches by certain firms, in Ethiopia, one lawyer offered to pay for access.
Adam Ramji of Texas-based Ramji Law Group sent Bayihe six messages in 20 minutes on July 13, and offered cash in exchange for a meeting, according to Bayihe and a review of his text messages.
""Let me give you $100 for 15 min of your time,"" Ramji wrote.
Bayihe has since filed a suit through Chicago-based Clifford Law Offices, telling Reuters he deliberately sought out a lawyer who had not pitched to him.
Ramji filed three lawsuits in Chicago. A judge threw out two of them after the families concerned said the names of the “executors” of the estate who were named as the lawsuits’ plaintiffs were unknown to them. A third suit was dismissed because there was no person by that name aboard the flight.
Ramji did not respond to requests for comment.
LACK OF RESOURCES
U.S. states have ethics rules that prohibit lawyers or anyone acting on their behalf from soliciting business by phone or in person, in most cases over any time period.
They also bar lawyers from giving anything of value to solicit a prospective client.
There is also a U.S. federal law that forbids lawyers from contacting victims' families within 45 days but it appears to be only applicable to U.S. aviation accidents, according to two legal experts.
Contacted about the cases cited in this story, Robert Glen Waddle, director and counsel at the Mississippi Bar’s Consumer Assistance Program, declined comment. Steven Splitt, spokesman at the disciplinary commission of the Illinois bar, and a spokeswoman for the Texas disciplinary board, also declined to comment.
U.S. disciplinary boards often don’t have the resources to investigate complaints from abroad, said Jim Grogan, former deputy administrator and chief counsel at the Illinois bar disciplinary commission.
“There are so many shadows in which people can act, especially abroad,” said Grogan."

Six people have now died in bushfires which have destroyed more than 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) across five states.
Potter Steve Harrison, 67, only survived a major blaze southwest of Sydney by crawling beneath a makeshift kiln as the flames passed over.
Harrison stayed to defend his property in the town of Balmoral on Sunday but by the time he changed his mind it was too late to leave.
""I ran to my ute (truck) but my garden was already on fire, the driveway was on fire, the road was on fire so I couldn't evacuate,"" Harrison told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
""The day before I had actually built myself a small kiln down the back — a coffin-sized kiln — just big enough for me to crawl inside,"" he said.
""I could have (died) if I hadn't thought about plan B. In that little kiln enclosure I made, I had a fire extinguisher, a bucket of water, a drinking water bottle and a fire blanket.""
The town of Balmoral, population 400 and 150 houses, was virtually destroyed, the New South Wales (NSW) State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. 
Australia has been fighting wildfires for months as hot, dry conditions brought about an early start to the fire season.
Australia posted record temperatures over 41 degrees Celsius (105 Celsius) last week as an extreme heatwave swept across the country and a long-running drought in the country's east has created tinder-dry conditions.
Nearly 100 fires are burning across New South Wales state.
""Conditions have begun to ease,"" the New South Wales (state) Rural Fire Service said on Monday. 
""Crews will continue their work today to identify and strengthen (fire) containment lines, with favorable conditions over coming days.""
Temperatures are forecast to spike again in many states by the weekend, with the South Australian capital city of Adelaide forecast to reach 39 Celsius (102.2 Fahrenheit), according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Similar temperatures are expected in the Victorian city of Melbourne.
In South Australia one person was confirmed dead in weekend fires and fire fighters were facing another tough day on Monday.

In the Adelaide Hills, a wine growing region where state authorities said 86 homes were destroyed, up to one third of the region's vineyards were in the ""burnout zone,"" equivalent to 1,100 hectares of vines, said Jared Stringer, vice president of Adelaide Hills wine region.

(Reuters) - Thirteen people were wounded in a shooting at a party on Chicago's south side intended to honor the victim of an earlier shooting, police said.
Police took two people into custody for questioning on Sunday, and one of them was charged with unlawful use of a weapon by a felon.
Marciano White, 37, was arrested near the scene of the shooting with a firearm, police spokesman Anthony Spicuzza said on Sunday evening. He has not been charged in connection with the shooting itself.
Chicago has struggled for years with violent crime, logging more murders annually than the combined figures from New York and Los Angeles, two much larger cities.
The victims ranged in age from 16 to 48, and 12 were in hospital on Sunday, hours after police responded at the scene at around 12:30 a.m. CT (0630 GMT), according to a police statement. 
Four of the victims, including a 16-year-old male, were critically wounded after suffering gunshot wounds to the chest or lower back.
The other person in custody, a 25-year-old male, was also a victim in the shooting, police said.
""This party was given in the memorial of a subject that was slain in April,"" Chicago Police Chief of Patrol Fred Waller said at an early morning news conference. ""We're still developing details as far as that goes.""
The city is in the midst of a search for a new permanent police superintendent, after Mayor Lori Lightfoot fired Eddie Johnson weeks before he was due to retire, accusing him of lying to her over an October incident in which patrol officers found him asleep in his car.

The poisoning occurred in Laguna and Quezon, two provinces south of Manila, and all had consumed lambanog, a drink popular in provinces and consumed widely during holidays and celebrations.
Many were admitted to hospitals on the urging of mayor Vener Munoz in Rizal, Laguna, where the deaths occurred between Thursday and Sunday.
Two people who had been in critical condition were improving, he told local radio. The coconut wine that was consumed had been made in his town, he added. 
Blood tests and samples of leftover lambanog would be collected and analyzed on Monday, the Department of Health said.
""All had a sad history of lambanog ingestion,"" the department said, referring to those poisoned.
""Some bought for leisure drinking and birthday party, while others were donated by local officials during their Christmas party.""
Unregulated production and sales of lambanog are common in the Philippines, and it is often made illegally with dangerous additives.
The country's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously warned about the dangerous and prohibited use of methanol as an additive in home brews.
A year ago, the FDA and police were deployed to locate and confiscate unregistered lambanog that was being openly sold to the public, and threatened to prosecute sellers. 
Twenty-one people died after consuming lambanog last year, media reported.

""We abhor the use of prison labor and would never allow it in our supply chain,"" a Tesco spokesman said on Sunday. 
""We were shocked by these allegations and immediately suspended the factory where these cards are produced and launched an investigation. We have also withdrawn these cards from sale whilst we investigate.""
Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, donates 300,000 pounds ($390,000) a year from the sale of the cards to the charities British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK.
The Sunday Times said the message inside the card read: ""We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu Prison China. Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organization.
""Use the link to contact Mr Peter Humphrey.""
Peter Humphrey is a British former journalist and corporate fraud investigator. 
The cards were produced at the Zheijiang Yunguang Printing factory, about 100 km (60 miles) from Shanghai Qingpu prison, Tesco said. 
The company, which prints cards and books for food and pharmaceutical companies, says on its website it supplies Tesco.
A staff member who answered the company's main telephone line on Monday told Reuters they were unaware of the press reports or Tesco's comments. She declined to provide her name. The company did not respond to further emailed requests for comment.
Humphrey and his American wife Yu Yingzeng were both sentenced in China in 2014 for illegally obtaining private records of Chinese citizens and selling the information to clients including drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline. The couple were deported from China in June 2015 after their jail terms were reduced.
The message inside the card was found by a 6-year-old girl, Florence Widdicombe, in London. Her father, Ben Widdicombe, contacted Humphrey via the LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) social network.
Florence Widdicombe said she was ""shocked"" to see the message in the card. ""We opened them about a week ago and we were writing in them, and on about my sixth or eighth card, somebody had already written in it,"" she told BBC TV.
Her father said at first he thought the note was a prank, but he later realized it was potentially a serious matter and he felt a responsibility to pass it on to Peter Humphrey as requested.
Writing in the Sunday Times, Humphrey said he did not know the identities or the nationalities of the prisoners who put the note into the card, but he ""had no doubt they are Qingpu prisoners who knew me before my release in June 2015 from the suburban prison where I spent 23 months"".
Tesco said it had a comprehensive auditing process in place. 
""This supplier was independently audited as recently as last month and no evidence was found to suggest they had broken our rule banning the use of prison labor,"" the spokesman said. 
""If a supplier breaches these rules, we will immediately and permanently de-list them.""

Humphrey and his wife said in their trial they had not thought they were doing anything illegal in their activities in China.

""Police can confirm a further person has died in Middlemore Hospital last night … police were advised of the death shortly before 11pm,"" said Police Deputy Commissioner John Tims in a statement.
Police did not provide any details on the identity or nationality of the person. The majority of the previously named victims after the powerful eruption of White Island, also known by its Māori name of Whakaari, were Australian citizens or permanent residents.
Those still missing, presumed dead, are Winona Langford, a 17-year-old Australian, and Hayden Marshall-Inman, a 40-year-old New Zealand tour guide. Their bodies are believed to have been washed out to sea.
Police has scaled back a search for the bodies but have said they have not given up hope of finding them.
There has been criticism that people were allowed on the island, a popular destination for day-trippers, given the risks of an active volcano. That has led to speculation the tragedy could lead to major changes for New Zealand's thrillseeker tourism industry.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said official inquiries by coroners and work safety regulators into the eruption could take up to one year, and will carry potential criminal penalties of up to five years in jail."

Four cruise missiles were believed to have been launched across the coast through Lebanese airspace toward Syria, a source in the regional alliance supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told Reuters.
Later the army said it had brought down one of the missiles in an area near the capital. It gave no further details and there was no immediate comment from Israel.
Israel has launched hundreds of missiles toward Syria in recent years, targeting Iranian-backed militias operating in the country as well as supplies sent by pro-Iranian Lebanese Hezbollah to support Assad's forces.
Iran and Hezbollah are fighting on the side of President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian war, and Israel says they are trying to turn Syria into a new front against Israelis.
Israel has vowed it will continue its strikes against Iranian targets trying to establish a permanent military presence there and against advanced weapons shipments to Hezbollah.

Milanovic got 29.5% of the votes ahead of incumbent center-right president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, the candidate of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), with 26.7%. Independent candidate Miroslav Skoro, a popular singer with conservative nationalist-leaning views came in third with 24.4% of votes.
Milanovic and Grabar-Kitarovic will face in a run-off on Jan. 5, 2020.
The presidential role is to a large extent ceremonial as the head of state cannot veto laws, but has a say in foreign policy and defense matters. The president has a five-year term with the next one starting in February 2020.
Despite her second place in the first round Grabar-Kitarovic, whose first term in office some observers assessed as rather bland with little policy substance and a lot of populist patriotic rhetoric, seems to be the favorite in the second round.
""Skoro's right wing voters are unlikely to support Milanovic, so Grabar-Kitarovic seems set to rely on a larger pool of potential voters in the second round,"" said political analyst Davor Gjenero.

The second round pits the candidates of the two biggest parties in a year when Croatia will also hold parliamentary elections, most likely in the autumn.

Israel tightly restricts movements out of the Gaza Strip, territory controlled by Hamas, an Islamist group that it considers a terrorist organization.
In a break from its usual Christmas holiday policy, Israel's military liaison to the Palestinians said on Dec. 12 that in accordance with ""security orders"" Gaza Christians would be allowed to travel abroad but none would be permitted to go Israel or the occupied West Bank.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey cannot handle a fresh wave of migrants from Syria, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday, warning that European countries will feel the impact of such an influx if violence in Syria's northwest is not stopped.
Turkey currently hosts some 3.7 million Syrian refugees, the largest refugee population in the world, and fears another wave from the Idlib region, where up to 3 million Syrians live in the last significant rebel-held swathe of territory.
Syrian and Russian forces have intensified their bombardment of targets in Idlib, which Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to recapture, prompting a wave of refugees toward Turkey.
Speaking at an awards ceremony in Istanbul on Sunday night, Erdogan said more than 80,000 people were currently on the move from Idlib to Turkey. 
""If the violence toward the people of Idlib does not stop, this number will increase even more. In that case, Turkey will not carry such a migrant burden on its own,"" Erdogan said.
""The negative impact of the pressure we will be subjected to will be something that all European nations, especially Greece, will also feel,"" he said, adding that a repeat of the 2015 migrant crisis would become inevitable.
He also said Turkey was doing everything possible to stop Russian bombardments in Idlib, adding that a Turkish delegation would go to Moscow to discuss Syria on Monday.
Erdogan has previously threatened to ""open the gates"" for migrants to Europe unless Turkey got more support in hosting the refugees. 
""NOT ENOUGH""
Turkey is seeking international support for plans to settle 1 million Syrians in part of northeast Syria that its forces and their Syrian rebel allies seized from the Kurdish YPG militia in a cross-border incursion in October.
Ankara has received little public backing for the proposal and has repeatedly slammed its allies for not supporting its plans. Turkey's offensive was also met with condemnation from allies, including the United States and European countries.
""We call on European countries to use their energy to stop the massacre in Idlib, rather than trying to corner Turkey for the legitimate steps it took in Syria,"" Erdogan said on Sunday, referring to the three military operations Turkey has carried out in Syria.
After a global refugee forum in Geneva last week, the United Nations refugee agency said states pledged more than $3 billion to support refugees and around 50,000 resettlement places. But, Erdogan, who attended the forum, said on Sunday that sum was not enough.
U.N agencies say hundreds of people have been killed in Idlib this year after attacks on residential areas.
Russia and the Syrian army, which is loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, both deny allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and say they are fighting al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants.
Rescue teams said six people were killed in Maarat al Numan and 11 more in nearby villages on Friday.

Earlier on Sunday, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said some 205,000 people had been displaced from their homes in Idlib since November due to the attacks. It said the fleeing civilians were going toward areas in Syria that Turkey seized in its military operations, or to other parts of Idlib.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the International Criminal Court of anti-Semitism on Sunday over its chief prosecutor's plan to pursue a war crimes probe in the Palestinian Territories.
The right-wing leader, who is fighting for his political life in a March election, made the allegation with Judaism's holy Western Wall as a backdrop during a candle-lighting ceremony marking the start of the eight-day Hanukkah holiday.
""New edicts are being cast against the Jewish people - anti-Semitic edicts by the International Criminal Court telling us that we, the Jews standing here next to this wall ... in this city, in this country, have no right to live here and that by doing so, we are committing a war crime,"" he said.
""Pure anti-Semitism,"" Netanyahu said, raising an argument likely to strike a chord with many Israelis who believe that criticism, especially in Europe, of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians has its roots in anti-Jewish sentiment.
The Hague-based International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said on Friday she would launch a full investigation into alleged war crimes in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip as soon as the court's jurisdiction had been established.
Israel captured those areas in the 1967 Middle East war and withdrew troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005.
Bensouda's announcement opens the possibility of charges being filed against Israelis or Palestinians. Israeli media, however, largely portrayed it as a bid to subject Israeli leaders and military officers to arrest and trial if they travel overseas.
Netanyahu's accusations appeared to be centered on a scenario in which Israeli settlement activities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where the Western Wall stands within the walled Old City, could be viewed by the court as war crimes.
ICC prosecutors have said a preliminary investigation on the West Bank focused on ""reported settlement-related activities engaged in by Israeli authorities"".
The Palestinians and many countries consider the settlements to be illegal. Israel disputes this, citing security needs and biblical and historical connections to the land.
The Palestinians have welcomed Bensouda's decision.
Netanyahu said on Friday the ICC had no jurisdiction to investigate events in the Palestinian Territories, arguing it could only examine petitions submitted by a sovereign state.
The ICC has the authority to hear cases of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity committed on the territory of the 123 countries that have signed up to it.
Israel has not joined the court but the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank, has done so. The Gaza Strip is run by the PA's rival, the Islamist Hamas group."

The Bolivian foreign ministry said in a statement that it hoped to ""contribute to a peaceful, democratic and constitutional solution to the crisis in Venezuela, which must be guided by the Venezuelan people.""
The Lima Group was founded in 2017 by countries including Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Santa Lucia, Canada, Colombia, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala, with the support of the United States, the Organization of American States and the European Union.
It has called for the release of political prisoners, the holding of free elections and the entry of humanitarian aid to the stricken country.
Bolivia's leftist former president, Evo Morales, had kept his country out of the bloc. Morales is a long-time ally of Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
Morales resigned from office and fled Bolivia in November amid pressure from the country's armed forces after an international audit detected significant irregularities in an election that had handed him a fresh mandate.
He went first to Mexico and then to Argentina where the new Peronist government of Alberto Fernandez has indicated it will give him political asylum.
Bolivia is currently governed by Jeanine Añez, a former senator and opponent of Morales. Añez stepped in as interim president after Morales resigned.

Trump's invitation was made after the British prime minister's election win this month, The Sunday Times newspaper reported. Britain wants to strike a new trade deal with the United States after it leaves the European Union at the end of January.
""Some potential dates have been floated in mid-January but nothing has yet been formally agreed. But it is clear that both sides want to make it happen some time in early 2020,"" the Sunday Times quoted a source close to the White House as saying.
A spokesman for Johnson's Downing Street office said the reports were ""speculation"". ""We will respond to any formal invitation, but anything less than that is speculation,"" he said.
Johnson is reluctant to make the visit before delivering Brexit on Jan. 31 and would prefer to go after a cabinet reshuffle scheduled in February, when he is expected to appoint cabinet office minister Michael Gove as his new trade negotiator, The Mail on Sunday reported.
That could allow Johnson to take Gove on the U.S. visit ahead of talks of a post-Brexit trade deal, according to the report.
Some Downing Street insiders, however, have concerns about a visit by Johnson due to fears the prime minister could be dragged into Trump's ongoing impeachment proceedings, the Sunday Times reported.
Johnson won approval for his Brexit deal in the British parliament on Friday, the first step toward fulfilling his election pledge to deliver Britain's departure from the European Union by Jan. 31.
As Britain prepares to leave the bloc, Johnson and Trump agreed in a phone call last Monday to pursue an ""ambitious"" UK-U.S. free trade agreement.
After Johnson's election win on Dec. 12, Trump had said Britain and the United States were now free to strike a ""massive"" new trade deal after Brexit.
""This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the EU,"" Trump had said in a tweet earlier this month.

Dubbed ""Scar of Bethlehem"", the display (pictured here) features a miniature Jesus, Mary and Joseph under a rendition of Israel's concrete West Bank barrier punctured by bullet holes, the largest of which resembles a star over the manger.
It is located in The Walled Off Hotel, which abuts the real barrier, and which the secretive Banksy opened in 2017.
""Christmas (is) known (for) the Star of Bethlehem, that led people to the birthplace of Jesus,"" said hotel manager Wisam Salsa. ""You see there is a scar, there is a hole on the wall that marks the wall and the life in Bethlehem how it is today.""
Israel says the barrier that cuts through the West Bank is a bulwark against Palestinian suicide bombers. Palestinians see it as a symbol of oppression in Israeli-occupied land they want for a state.
Arnaud Lucien, a tourist from France, saw hope in the art.
""It's a scene, a biblical scene which is turned political,"" he said. ""And the message is very interesting because the message of peace is done for Palestinians and Israelis, and I think it's a very nice piece of art.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russian-backed Syrian forces have gained ground after a week-long renewed assault against the last opposition enclave in Syria's northwest, the biggest such push in more than three months that has prompted a large civilian exodus, witnesses and residents said on Sunday.
The wide-scale offensive led by intense aerial strikes on civilian areas in rural southeastern Idlib province broke months of stalemate on the frontlines, where rebels had been holding back the army from major advances, they said.
Russian and Syrian jets have stepped up strikes on villages and towns around Maarat al-Numan, from which thousands of people have fled to the relative safety of the Turkish border fearing an imminent assault.
Russian jets hit a convoy of civilian cars fleeing the city, according to activists who posted videos online showing several charred bodies. Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the videos. Rescuers said at least eight people were killed, including three women and two children.
On Saturday, Russian jets hit a busy marketplace in Saraqeb city, east of Idlib, leaving at least eight dead and scores injured, two residents and one rescuer said.
There was no immediate comment from the Russian military.
Russia and the Syrian army, which is loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, both deny allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and say they are fighting al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants.
The Syrian army said it had gained more than 20 villages and hilltops and was coming close to one of 12 Turkish observation posts in the northwest, part of a deal with Moscow and Tehran in 2017 to avert large-scale fighting in Adlib.
Residents in the area said many villages were now deserted in a campaign that, since it first started in April, has displaced more than 500,000 people, according to the United Nations and international relief groups.
""Many villages and towns have turned into ghost towns. Russia's 'scorched earth' bombing is helping the army gain ground,"" said Mohamad Rasheed, an activist from the area said.
In the past week alone, at least 80,000 civilians fled and face harsh conditions during the start of winter, said the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), a U.S.-based medical NGO.
Medical facilities, already crippled by a year of attacks, are struggling to deal with the influx of wounded, it said. At least 68 medical facilities have been attacked since April, the NGO and other U.N. agencies have documented.
Western military sources said the latest bombardment was a prelude to a widescale ground offensive to take over rebel-held Idlib province. 

The Idlib region is home to hundreds of thousands of people who fled other parts of Syria as government forces wrested back large areas of the country following Russian intervention on Assad's side in early 2015 that tipped the war in his favor.

Turkey backs Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya, which has been torn by factional conflict since 2011, and has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month.
Turkey has also said it could deploy troops to Libya if the GNA makes such a request. The GNA has been fighting a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces based in the east of the country. Haftar's forces have received support from Russia, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
""If necessary, we will increase the military aspect of our support to Libya, and evaluate all our options, from the ground, air and sea,"" Erdogan said at an event in the northern province of Kocaeli.
Speaking before Erdogan, Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey will stand by Libya's government until peace, stability and security are established in the country.
Last month, Turkey and the GNA signed an agreement to boost military cooperation and a separate deal on maritime boundaries, which has enraged Greece. Ankara and Athens have been at odds over hydrocarbon resources off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus.
While Greece has said the accord violates international law, Turkey has rejected those accusations, saying it aims to protect its rights in the eastern Mediterranean. On Sunday, Erdogan said Turkey will ""absolutely"" not turn back from its agreements with Libya.
""Nobody should come to us with attempts to exclude us, trap us in our own shores or steal our economic interests,"" Erdogan said. ""We have no intention of starting conflicts with anyone for no reason, or robbing anyone of their rights,"" he said.
""Those who oppose us have no sense of rights, law, justice, ethics or mercy,"" Erdogan said, referring to Greece, Israel and Egypt, who have opposed the maritime accord.
In a first reaction from the United States on the agreement, a senior U.S. State Department official said the maritime accord was ""unhelpful"" and ""provocative."""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Sexual abuse of minors was rife among superiors of the Legionaires of Christ Catholic religious order, with at least 60 boys abused by its founder Father Marcial Maciel, a report by the group showed.
The report is important because for decades until 2006, including during all of the pontificate of Pope John Paul, the Vatican dismissed accusations by seminarians that Maciel had abused them sexually, some when they were as young as 12.
The order said the report, which was released on Saturday and covers the period since Maciel founded it in his native Mexico in 1941 to this year, was ""an additional attempt (by the Legionaires) to confront their history"".
Maciel, who died in 2008, was perhaps the Roman Catholic Church's most notorious pedophile, even abusing children he had fathered secretly with at least two women while living a double life and being feted by the Vatican and Church conservatives.
Cardinal Angelo Sodano, 92, who was secretary of state under John Paul, was for years one of the Legionaires' biggest protectors in the Vatican.
Pope Francis accepted his resignation as dean of the college of cardinals on Saturday and simultaneously changed church law to limit the dean's position to a five-year term, rather than for life.
The Vatican first acknowledged Maciel's crimes in 2006, when former Pope Benedict ordered him to retire to a life of ""prayer and penitence. But Benedict resisted calls from some in the Church who said the order should be dissolved because it was toxic to the core.
The Vatican instead took over the order in 2010 and began a process of reform.
The new report says that between 1941 and 2019, 175 minors were victims of abuse by 33 priests in the order. At least 60, or about one-third, were abused by Maciel himself, it said.
Most victims were boys between 11 and 16, it said. 
While the report said the 33 amounted to only 2.44% of the 1,353 priests ordained by the order, it said that nearly 43% of those who committed the abuse were in positions of authority, making it difficult to report or punish the abuse.
""(Abuse) was linked to the abuse of power and conscience on the part of some who took advantage of their posts to abuse,"" it said.
Of the 33, six have died, eight have left the priesthood, and one had left the order. Of the 18 who remain members, four have ""ministerial restrictions"" to keep them away from minors and 14 have no public priestly ministry, the report said.
Seventy-four seminarians studying for the priesthood also abused minors and 81% of them were not ordained. 
After Maciel's death, Vatican investigations found that he had also fathered several children with at least two women, visited them regularly and sent them money. He also used drugs.
Former members have said the order was run like a cult, with rules forbidding any criticism of the founder or questioning of his motives.

They said Maciel gave huge contributions to the Vatican during the papacy of John Paul, who admired the Legionaires' orthodoxy and ability to produce vocations.

New Delhi's state election early next year will be the first major electoral test for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in the wake of the mass demonstrations seen after parliament cleared the Citizenship Amendment Act on Dec. 11.
Several thousand people took part in Modi's rally where he accused the opposition of distorting facts to trigger protests.
""The law does not impact 1.3 billions Indians, and I must assure Muslim citizens of India that this law will not change anything for them,"" said Modi, adding that his government introduces reforms without any religious bias.
""We have never asked anyone if they go to a temple or a mosque when it comes to implementing welfare schemes,"" he said.
Modi's nationalist party plans to hold more than 200 news conferences to counter the protests as anger grows over what critics say is an attack on the country's secular constitution.
At least 21 people have died during clashes with police as thousands of people came out on the streets in towns and cities across the country to protest, marking the biggest challenge to Modi's leadership since he first swept to power in 2014.
Fresh demonstrations were planned for Sunday in New Delhi, and northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where the largest number of deaths have occurred. 
In most places, the demonstrations have been joined by people of all faiths, but Uttar Pradesh is a tinder-box for communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims, and authorities there have shut internet and mobile messaging services to prevent the circulation of inflammatory material. 
More than 1,500 protesters have been arrested across India in the past 10 days, additionally, some 4,000 people have been detained and then released, the officials said. 
Criticism has also fallen on police, who have been accused of using disproportionate force, using baton charges, and tear gas, and entering university campuses and assaulting students.
Modi's government says that the new law is required to help non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who fled to India before 2015 by providing them with a pathway to Indian citizenship.
But many Indians feel that the CAA discriminates against Muslims and violates the country's secular constitution by making religion a test for citizenship.
Alarmed by spreading protests and the rising violence, authorities have order a shut down of internet and mobile messaging services in Delhi, shut metro stations and canceled permissions for large demonstrations.
Still, on Friday, some protesters clashed with police and set a car alight before being scattered by a water cannon in a commercial in central Delhi close to where Modi held his rally on Sunday.
Earlier in the week, thousands of stone-pelting protesters battled police, who fired shots in the air and used tear gas, in north east Delhi.
The eastern state of Jharkhand is in the final stages of its drawn out election, with the count set for Dec. 23, and the fall out from the furor over the citizenship act will be more evident once Delhi votes in coming months. 
A small regional party currently controls the state government in Delhi, but Modi's BJP is hoping the fulfillment of a series of major manifesto promises will galvanize its right-wing support base.
In August, Modi revoked the special status of the Muslim-majority Kashmir region, and in November, a court ruling cleared the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a mosque razed by Hindu zealots.
And now, with the CAA, some are questioning the government's stance toward Indian Muslims, who make up around 14% of the country's population.

Protests against the new law come amid the slowest economic growth in more than six years, rising unemployment and growing discontent by several surprise government decisions.

Dozens of police marched across a public square overlooking Hong Kong's harbor to face off with protesters who hurled glass bottles and rocks at them.
Earlier in the afternoon more than 1,000 people had rallied calmly, waving Uighur flags and posters, as they took part in the latest demonstration in over six months of unrest.
A mixed crowd of young and elderly people, dressed in black and wearing masks to shield their identities, held up signs reading ""Free Uyghur, Free Hong Kong"" and ""Fake 'autonomy' in China results in genocide"".
The protest comes after midfielder Mesut Ozil of English soccer club Arsenal caused a furor in China after he criticized the country's policies toward the Muslim ethnic minority in the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang.
Ozil, a German Muslim of Turkish origin, tweeted that Uighurs were ""warriors who resist persecution"" and criticized both China's strong hand in Xinjiang and the relative silence of Muslims in response.
""I think basic freedom and independence should exist for all people, not just for Hong Kong,"" said a 41-year-old woman surnamed Wong who attended the protest with her husband.
United Nations experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in Xinjiang since 2017 under a campaign that has been condemned by the United States and other countries. 
Beijing says it is providing vocational training to help stamp out separatism and to teach new skills. It denies any mistreatment of Uighurs.
Protests in Hong Kong are now in their seventh month, albeit in a relative year-end lull. Many residents are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
On Saturday, Hong Kong riot police swept into several shopping malls, chasing off and arresting demonstrators pressing their demands in the peak shopping weekend before Christmas.
The police's heavy-handed clamp-down on demonstrations and frequent use of tear gas have incensed many protesters, whose demands include full democracy and an independent investigation into perceived police brutality.
The protests, which started in June, have pushed Hong Kong's economy into recession. Retailers and businesses have been hit hard as tourists stay away amid transport disruptions.
The city's Financial Secretary Paul Chan, in his blog on Sunday, said there could be a wave of business closures in the new year if market conditions do not improve.

""Many companies are now clenching their teeth and struggling to maintain their businesses,"" he said, adding that he hoped the violence would stop.

""U.S. President Donald Trump sent a short letter in which he said that they are ready to continue looking for ways to overcome the problems in our relations,"" Interfax cited the minister as saying on a TV talk show.
The letter was in response to Putin's offer to introduce a moratorium on the development of missiles banned by the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, Interfax cited Lavrov as saying.
The U.S. formally left the INF treaty with Russia in August after determining that Moscow was violating the treaty and had already deployed one banned type of missile, an accusation the Kremlin denies."

Under a law dating back to 1955, France's presidents are entitled to draw a pension of about 6,000 euros ($6,650) per month before tax as soon as they leave office.
Macron will waive these pension rights and change the presidential scheme to bring it into line with the wider overhaul of France's retirement system, his office said, confirming an earlier report by French daily Le Parisien. 
The 42-year-old president will be years away from France's legal retirement age of 62 when he leaves office even he serves two full five-year terms.
""The President of the Republic will converge ... with the universal points system planned for all French people,"" Macron's office said. 
""It is a question of being exemplary and coherent.""
Two weeks of nationwide industrial action against Macron's pension reform, which would scrap special regimes for sectors like the railways and make people work to 64 to draw a full pension, have crippled train services.
Speaking on Saturday during a visit to Ivory Coast, Macron called on transport unions to suspend strikes during the Christmas holidays to avoid disrupting travel for families.
But despite calls by some unions to suspend strikes during the festive season, several rail workers' groups are continuing stoppages as travelers head off on holiday.
National rail operator SNCF continued to run reduced services on Sunday, including half the usual number of its high-speed TGV trains.

But faced with an outcry over the cancellation of holiday services for children traveling without their parents, the SNCF laid on several trains for kids on Sunday.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Rafi Tabakian's clothing store in a Beirut suburb is usually buzzing with customers during the holiday season, but with Lebanon's economy in ruins, shoppers are in short supply.
""We've been in business for 30 years, and I've never seen anything like this,"" he said, adding that sales have dropped 80% in December even though he has cut his prices.
""Now we see customers entering, asking for the price, and then leaving. It's scary,"" Tabakian, who produces and sells clothes in the densely populated, commercial Burj Hammoud neighborhood of the capital, told Reuters.
Lebanon is suffering its worst economic crisis, rooted in decades of state corruption and waste, since the 1975-1990 civil war, leaving streets dimmer and shopping centers emptier, with many stores and restaurants void of customers.
The economic woes have sparked huge protests against the ruling elite, banks are imposing capital controls, pressure has piled on the pegged Lebanese pound, and a hard currency crunch has pushed importers to hike prices.
Hotel bookings, flights and events have plunged during what is usually a busy commercial season for Lebanon, which has the Arab world's biggest proportion of Christians.
Many from Lebanon's large diaspora normally return home to streets packed with cars and decked out with lights.
But Pierre Ashkar, the head of Lebanon's hotel association, said December bookings have plummeted from a usual 65-75% occupancy to 7-15% this year.
""Hotels have closed some parts of their buildings, are giving employees unpaid leave and removing services such as free shuttle transportation to the airport to minimize losses.""
Some local councils have opted to either re-use old decorations or do without.
""We put up last year's decorations, without adding anything because these are exceptional circumstances,"" said Raymond Atieh, head of the Jdeideh municipality, north of Beirut.
""The holidays are coming, but they're coming with a pinch. People are angry...People are getting fired, paid half-salaries, or not working,"" Atieh added.
Charbel Daccache, a priest in Mount Lebanon's largely Christian town of Adma, said it was better to help feed the poor in tough times ""than to decorate and throw glitter"".
""Some days are harsh, others are better but it's not the end. That's why I tell people, let it be a joyous time."""

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's incumbent President Ashraf Ghani won a slim majority of votes in a Sept. 28 election, delayed preliminary results showed on Sunday, after a poll that plunged the country into political crisis and was marred by allegations of fraud.
The Independent Election Commission (IEC) said the total turnout in the presidential election was over 1.8 million with Ghani securing 50.64%, enough to win the first round of voting, beating his main challenger Abdullah Abdullah, who currently shares power with Ghani in a unity government.
However, the head of IEC, Hawa Alam Nuristani, told a press conference in Kabul that the outcome could change after final results and was still subject to a review by the election complaints' commission.
If a review showed Ghani's vote falling below 50% and no other candidate with a majority, a second round of voting would be held, she said.
According to the tally released by the IEC on Sunday, the total turnout was 1,824,401 with Ghani winning 923,868 votes while Abdullah finished second with 39.5% and 720,099 votes.
The United States, Afghanistan's biggest donor, reacted cautiously to the result.
""It is important for Afghans to remember: these results are preliminary. Many steps remain before final election results are certified, to ensure the Afghan people have confidence in the results,"" John Bass U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan said in a post on Twitter.
In a statement on Sunday, Abdullah's office said he did not accept the preliminary results and that the commission had failed to tackle election fraud.
""The result that stands is based on fraud and without considering our legitimate demands, will never be accepted,"" the statement said.
With 9.7 million registered voters, according to IEC, Afghanistan's 1.9 million voter turnout for the presidential election was low. 
Last month, IEC began recounting thousands of votes due to what it described as discrepancies in its system. Abdullah's side objected to the recount and called it an attempt to add more votes in favor of Ghani. IEC dismissed those allegations.
In protest, Abdullah's supporters blocked IEC offices in seven northern provinces to prevent the recount, creating delays in the results' announcement.
Last week, Abdullah allowed the recount but warned that he would not accept a tainted result.
The situation echoes 2014 when both Ghani and Abdullah alleged massive fraud by each other, forcing the United States to broker an awkward power-sharing arrangement that made Ghani president and Abdullah his chief executive.
Aides close to Ghani, a Western-educated former World Bank official, said the incumbent was not ready for another power sharing deal with Abdullah, a former medical doctor.
Without a unifying leader accepted by all sides, Afghanistan could split further along tribal and ethnic lines.
The election result also comes at a critical time for Afghanistan as the United States is showing more interest in negotiating a peace settlement with the Taliban to end the war that has dragged on for more than 18 years.
Eighty five civilians were killed and more than 370 wounded in militant attacks and violence on the day of the election, the United Nations said last month, and the country plunged into chaos with both Ghani's and Abdullah's camps claiming victory before ballots had been tallied.
The U.N. report accused the Taliban of deliberate attacks against civilians on election day.
Many Afghans fear a deeply flawed vote combined with bitter tensions between political camps could drive war-weary Afghanistan into deeper political instability.

Election result announcements in Afghanistan are typically followed by violent protests from supporters of losing candidates.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 03:02AM ET</span>","More freedom, but predictable outcome: Uzbekistan votes for new parliament","ALMATY (Reuters) - All five parties running in a parliamentary election in Uzbekistan on Sunday have backed reformist President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, meaning that although the vote will be the freest in decades, it is likely to produce a legislature loyal to him.
The election is the first in the nation of 33 million since Mirziyoyev took power in late 2016 following the death of strongman Islam Karimov, who had run the former Soviet republic as a police state for 27 years.
Polls opened earlier on Sunday and voting will close at 1500 GMT with preliminary results expected later in the day.
Mirziyoyev, a former prime minister, has pledged to open up the resource-rich nation after decades of near-isolation, liberalizing both the economic and political systems.
The vote is being held under a modernized legal framework and follows campaigning that for the first time in Uzbekistan's history included televised debates between the competing parties.
However, a monitoring mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in a report this month there was still work to be done. Legal amendments addressing the OSCE's longstanding recommendations regarding fundamental freedoms of assembly, association and expression ""have been few"", it said.
The five competing parties are Liberal Democrats who nominated Mirziyoyev for presidency in 2016, the Milliy Tiklanish (National Revival) party, the People’s Democratic Party, the Adolat (Justice) Social Democratic Party, and the green Ecological Party. 
All five have expressed the same emphatic support for Mirziyoyev's reforms as they did for Karimov's conservative approach, and no one disagreed with the president's policies during the debates. Even the Ecological Party, for example, supports plans to build a nuclear power plant.
Despite the relative lack of bold policies, increased democratic options for voters are expected to help new entrants like the Ecological Party, which had not taken part in previous elections but held some non-elected seats in parliament.
""The Ecological Party are new and have certain clear objectives while other parties are just too much 'Hurrah-hurrah!' with vague concepts, like in the old times,"" Akrom Mirkhalikov, an engineer, said at a polling station in the capital, Tashkent.
Live television appearances have exposed party leaders to public criticism. One of them was scorned after saying during a discussion on minimum wages that 2.5 million sums ($263) a month was sufficient for a family of five to live on, which viewers regarded a sign of being out of touch with reality. 
Another party leader said people trying to cut costs when traveling to work abroad - which millions of Uzbeks do - have no self-respect. That phrase was seen by many as an insensitive reference to an incident in which 52 Uzbeks died when their bus caught fire in Kazakhstan last year.
Lola Abdurahmonova, a 65-year-old retired teacher, said the choice between parties was difficult, but decided to vote for Adolat based on the debates.

""I liked the issues they raised and what they want to do,"" she said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a meeting of top military officials to discuss boosting the country's military capability, state news agency reported on Sunday amid heightened concern the North may be about to return to confrontation with Washington.
Kim presided over an enlarged meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's Central Military Commission, KCNA news agency said, to discuss steps ""to bolster up the overall armed forces of the country ... militarily and politically.""
""Also discussed were important issues for decisive improvement of the overall national defense and core matters for the sustained and accelerated development of military capability for self-defense,"" KCNA said.
It did not give details on when the meeting was held nor what was decided.
The commission is North Korea's top military decision-making body. Kim rules the country as its supreme military commander and is the chairman of the commission.
North Korea has set a year-end deadline for the United States to change what it says is a policy of hostility amid a stalemate in efforts to make progress on their pledge to end the North's nuclear program and establish lasting peace.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since June 2018, but there has been no substantive progress in dialogue while the North demanded crushing international sanctions be lifted first.
On Saturday, the state media said the United States would ""pay dearly"" for taking issue with the North's human rights record and said Washington's ""malicious words"" would only aggravate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea has also repeatedly called for the United States to drop its ""hostile policy"" and warned about its ""Christmas gift"" as the end-year deadline it set for Washington to change its position looms.
Some experts say the reclusive state may be preparing for an intercontinental ballistic missile test that could put it back on a path of confrontation with the United States.
The U.S. envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, has visited South Korea and China in the past week, issuing a public and direct call to North Korea to return to the negotiating table, but there has been no response.

In an interview with Argentine radio, Morales, who has sought political asylum in Argentina, said he had called the meeting of the Movement for Socialism party, which he helmed for 14 years as president.
""We will choose our candidate with a view to the upcoming elections in Bolivia,"" Morales told Radio La Network.
An October vote to pick a new president, vice president and some national legislators was annulled because of serious irregularities detected by an international audit.
The vote-rigging scandal forced Morales to resign and leave Bolivia in mid-November.
This week, lawmakers appointed a six-member electoral tribunal, which is expected to set a date by Jan. 2 for new elections within 120 days.
The ex-president did not report the place of the meeting, but the local press suggested it could take place in the cities of Oran or Salvador Mazza, in the province of Salta, about 1,300 kilometers (808 miles) northwest of Buenos Aires.
Morales said the Argentine government had agreed to provide security for the event.
The indigenous leader has been a staying in Argentina since Dec. 12, after he left Mexico, where he fled to after resigning from the presidency and under pressure from the armed forces.
The former coca farmer won a fourth consecutive term in the Oct. 20 election and claimed he was ousted in a coup d'etat.
Bolivian prosecutors issued an arrest warrant against him on Wednesday for the crimes of sedition, terrorism and terrorist financing, promoted by the government of Jeanine Áñez, a former senator and opponent of Morales who stepped in as interim president in November.
Morales has ruled out running as a candidate himself and has named Luis Arce Catacora, his former economy minister, and Andronico Rodriguez, a key coca farmer union boss, as potential MAS presidential candidates."

BEIJING (Reuters) - The spectre of new confrontation between Pyongyang and Washington hangs over meetings between China, Japan and South Korea this week, with growing risks North Korean actions could end an uneasy detente and upend recent diplomatic efforts.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping separately on Monday. They will then travel to the southwestern city of Chengdu for a trilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Though they are expected to discuss various economic matters, North Korea appears likely to dominate the agenda.
Pyongyang has grown increasingly frustrated that its halt of nuclear and long-range missile tests has not ended the crippling economic sanctions against it. It set a Dec. 31 deadline for the United States to make concessions, but Washington has been unmoved.
Some experts believe North Korea may be readying to test an intercontinental ballistic missile launch soon, which would likely end the 2018 agreement struck by its leader, Kim Jong Un, and U.S. President Donald Trump.
""Safeguarding the stability and peace of the Korean Peninsula and pushing for a political solution to the Korean Peninsula issue are in the interests of China, Japan and South Korea,"" Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui told reporters on Thursday at a briefing on the trilateral meetings.
U.S. special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun met with two senior Chinese diplomats during his two-day visit to Beijing this week, following similar meeting in South Korea and Japan days earlier, as diplomats make last-ditch attempts to prevent new confrontation.
North Korea has not responded to his public call to resume dialogue, however.
""The silence, even after Biegun's speech in Seoul, makes me concerned,"" Jenny Town, managing editor at the North Korea monitoring website 38 North, said on Twitter.
Beijing, jointly with Russia, proposed on Monday that the United Nations Security Council lift some sanctions in what it calls an attempt to break the current deadlock and seeks to build support. But it's unclear whether Beijing can convince Seoul and Tokyo to break ranks from Washington, which has made its opposition clear and can veto any resolution.
Though South Korea sees China as instrumental in reviving negotiations, it has so far sidestepped questions on whether it supports the new proposal by Beijing and Moscow. Japan, which has historically been a staunch supporter of sanctions against North Korea, has also refrained from commenting on the proposal.
""With the (2020 Tokyo) Olympics coming up, North Korea going wild would pose a problem for Japan,"" said Narushige Michishita, professor at Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies.
""But bilateral talks with North Korea, for example, will probably be a better approach for Japan than easing UN sanctions."""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The commander-in-chief of the Chilean Air Force has warned that the struggle to recover the remains of a Hercules that crashed en route to the Antarctic two weeks ago could make it difficult to ever determine what happened to the plane.
The Hercules C-130 cargo plane, which was carrying 17 crew members and 21 passengers, disappeared shortly after taking off on Dec. 9 from the southern city of Punta Arenas in Chilean Patagonia.
Extreme weather conditions, including low clouds, strong winds and massive, rolling ocean swells initially complicated search efforts, but within days an international team had recovered some debris, personal effects and human remains 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) south of where the plane last made contact.
This week the investigators began underwater searches in the Drake Sea, a vast untouched ocean wilderness off the southernmost edge of the South American continent that plunges to 3,500 meters (11,500 feet).
The commander-in-chief of the Chilean Air Force, Arturo Merino Núñez, said that because more debris had not yet been found, it was possible they would ""never know"" what happened to the plane. ""Hopefully, it will not come to that,"" he added.
""From what we have found and given the context, the truth is that the plane suffered a complete collapse that caused it to disintegrate, either in the sea or in the air,"" he said.
If larger parts of the plane debris were found, he said, ""it would allow us to disregard the less probable hypotheses and zone in on what really caused the accident.""
""At this stage all possible hypotheses are going to be studied with an open mind,"" he said. ""We are all pilots and want to know what happened to the aircraft to take corrective measures, if there were any to take. That is also very distressing for us because we have to continue operating the plane, Antarctic campaigns have to continue."""

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - Arif Munandar had been pronounced dead before he woke up in a body bag four days after a monstrous wave swept his village in Indonesia's northern Aceh province 15 years ago.
When a 9.1-magnitude quake opened a faultline deep beneath the Indian Ocean, it triggered a tsunami as high as 17.4 meters (57 feet), killing more than 230,000 people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and nine other countries.
Aceh province bore the brunt of the disaster. A total of 128,858 people were killed there, according to statistics compiled by the government and aid agencies. Another 37,087 are still listed as missing.
Munandar, who spent six years living in a relief camp before he was able to complete the rebuilding of his old house with government help, lost 24 family members, including his wife and three children. He has since remarried and has two children.
Now, the 49-year-old works as a radio communication technician at Aceh's disaster mitigation agency, and considers it his personal mission to keep his village's tsunami warning system well-maintained.
""We need to provide information to the community in order to minimize the number of casualties when such a disaster happens again,"" said Munandar, stressing the need to anticipate the worst.
More than $400 million has been spent across 28 countries on the early-warning system, comprising 101 sea-level gauges, 148 seismometers and nine buoys.
""The Indian Ocean region is much safer against the tsunami threat than it was in 2004,"" said Srinivasa Tummala, head of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (IOTWMS) established in 2013.
However, a lack of sufficient tsunami buoys, other detection equipment, and real-time data-sharing, as well as the difficulty of maintaining the tsunami detection system, remain the biggest hurdles, he said.
Threats like the twin tsunamis triggered by underwater landslides in Indonesia's Palu and Banten province last year, which hit the shore in a shorter timeframe, also continue to challenge the early warning system, Tummala added.
Experts are exploring new technologies such as mobile apps and a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network to enhance preparedness.
The focus of the tsunami warning mitigation system is now on community readiness, Tummala said, including carrying out regular drills.
In the coastal Ban Nam Khem village, in southern Thailand, which lost more than half its population in the 2004 tsunami, the national anthem is played weekly on the tsunami warning tower as a form of test run for a nightmare they hope will never recur.
""The tower shouldn't be used just for warnings about a tsunami,"" said village community leader Prayoon Chonkraichak.
""It should be utilized for more purposes so that it's worth the budget, and more importantly, so people in the community can have more confidence in it."""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison visited the Rural Fire Service (RFS) headquarters in Sydney, having returned from a holiday in Hawaii on Saturday night that has drawn sharp criticism as the wildfires crisis in his home state deepened. 
After the deaths of two firefighters on Thursday night, Morrison announced he would return home early, and on Sunday he acknowledged his holiday had caused anxiety. 
The intensity of fires eased overnight in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia states, where fires had been burning out of control on Friday and Saturday as a combination of extreme heat and strong winds had created ""catastrophic"" conditions in some areas.
""We have still got an enormous amount of fire burning in the landscape,"" NSW RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said, adding that the spreading fires in the Blue Mountains area around 100 km (62 miles) west of Sydney would be a significant focus for fire crews. 
""We've seen widespread damage and destruction being reported across a number of these fire grounds, and we've got impact assessment teams already deployed into the field this morning.""
More than 105 fires were still burning across NSW on Sunday, with 59 considered uncontained, although none were burning at the emergency level that a number were classed at during Saturday's heat and wind. 
One man is still unaccounted for after staying on Saturday to protect his property near Lithgow, a town west of Sydney, as fires approached. Dozens of properties were reported damaged or destroyed.
""Today is thankfully expected to be much cooler for large sections of NSW, which will be a welcome reprieve. However, many communities away from the coast will still experience significant heat,"" the Bureau of Meteorology said in a tweet.
Conditions are expected to remain favorable over coming days and firefighters will work to contain some of the firefronts near communities, particularly in the Blue Mountains region to the west of Sydney.
""This (fire) season is much more lengthened and has started a lot earlier, and there isn't the respite rains that we can expect any time soon, and that is making this season harder than many we have seen in a long time,"" Prime Minister Morrison said.
Australia has been fighting wildfires for months as hot, dry conditions created an early start to the fire season, with blazes destroying more than 700 homes and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland. 
Smoke from bushfires prompted match officials to abandon Saturday's Big Bash League cricket match in Canberra over what they called ""dangerous and unreasonable playing conditions""..

Turkey's parliament on Saturday approved a security and military cooperation deal signed with Tripoli government last month, state media reported, an agreement that could pave the way for military help from Ankara.
A National Libyan Army forces naval combat vessel stopped the ship in Libyan territorial waters off the eastern city of Derna and towed it to Ras El Hilal port ""for inspection and to verify its cargo"", spokesman Ahmed Mismari told Reuters. He gave no further details.
The eastern forces loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar provided Reuters with a video that shows Libyan navy forces stopping the ship and questioning three crew members. They also published copies of passports of three Turkish nationals.
It was not immediately clear what the ship was carrying. Ankara has sent military supplies to Libya in violation of a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month.
Turkey has been backing the Libyan Government of National Accord led by Fayez al-Serraj as it fights off a months-long offensive by Haftar's forces.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey could deploy troops to Libya in support of the GNA, but no request has been made."

""Strike action is justifiable and protected by the constitution, but I think there are moments in a nation's life when it is good to observe a truce out of respect for families and family life,"" Macron said during a news conference with Ivorian counterpart Alassane Ouattara.
Two weeks of nationwide industrial action against Macron's planned overhaul of the pension system, including the scrapping of special regimes for sectors like the railways, have crippled train services.
Despite calls by some unions to suspend strikes during the festive season, several rail worker groups are continuing stoppages as travelers head off on holiday.
Macron said a strike pause would not mean unions had abandoned their demands, but would show ""the sense of responsibility and the respect owed to French people who are sometimes apart and wish to be reunited during this festive period.""

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Saturday named tourism minister Manuel Marrero Cruz as the country’s first prime minister in decades, under a new constitution that seeks to decentralize former leader Fidel Castro’s job.
Manuel Marrero Cruz, 56, an architect and whose nomination was ratified by the National Assembly, is a former functionary of the military-run Gaviota tourism corporation whose hotels have been sanctioned by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Marrero, tourism minister for 15 years, presided over the growth of the industry into Cuba's most important, with dozens of partnerships with foreign companies and broad connections with the growing private sector.
Unlike many other countries where prime ministers often play central, political roles, the post involves day-to-day supervision of the Council of Ministers (cabinet) and the implementation of policy.
""The head of government will be the administrative right hand of the president of the republic,"" the state-run Cubadebate online news outlet said.
William LeoGrande, a professor of government and Cuba expert at American University in Washington said the post was different than in a multiparty system.
""It's a division of responsibilities rather than a division of authority,"" he said.
Castro was prime minister until 1976 when the post was abolished. The iconic revolutionary became head of the Communist Party and president of the Council of State and Council of Ministers. 
Castro, who ceded power in 2006 to his brother Raul, died in 2016. He was famous for micromanaging the Caribbean island nation.
Raul Castro stepped down as president in 2018, but remains head of the Communist Party.
Now, under the constitution passed earlier this year, the President of the Republic Diaz-Canel no longer heads-up either the Council of State, presided over by the president of the National Assembly Esteban Lazo, or Council of Ministers, though he maintains ultimate authority.
Cuban officials say changes in government structure aim to improve accountability and administration of the bureaucracy and state-run economy.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - West Africa's monetary union has agreed with France to rename its CFA franc the Eco and cut some of the financial links with Paris that have underpinned the region's common currency since its creation soon World War Two.
Under the deal, the Eco will remain pegged to the euro but the African countries in the bloc won't have to keep 50% of their reserves in the French Treasury and there will no longer be a French representative on the currency union's board.
Critics of the CFA have long seen it as a relic from colonial times while proponents of the currency say it has provided financial stability in a sometimes turbulent region.
""This is a historic day for West Africa,"" Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara said during a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in the country's main city Abidjan.
In 2017, Macron highlighted the stabilizing benefits of the CFA but said it was up to African governments to determine the future of the currency.
""Yes, it's the end of certain relics of the past. Yes it's progress ... I do not want influence through guardianship, I do not want influence through intrusion. That's not the century that's being built today,"" said Macron.
The CFA is used in 14 African countries with a combined population of about 150 million and $235 billion of gross domestic product.
However, the changes will only affect the West African form of the currency used by Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo - all former French colonies except Guinea Bissau.
The six countries using the Central African CFA are Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, - all former French colonies with the exception of Equatorial Guinea.
The CFA's value relative to the French franc remained unchanged from 1948 through to 1994 when it was devalued by 50% to boost exports from the region.
After the devaluation, 1 French franc was worth 100 CFA and when the French currency joined the euro zone, the fixed rate became 1 euro to 656 CFA francs.
The agreement follows talks in Nigeria's capital Abuja on Saturday between West African leaders. Countries in the CFA bloc and other West African nations such as Nigeria and Ghana have for decades debated creating their own currency to promote regional trade and investment.
The CFA franc was born in 1945 and at the time stood for ""Colonies Francaises d'Afrique"" (French Colonies in Africa). 

It now stands for ""Communaute Financiere Africaine"" (African Financial Community) in West Africa and in Central Africa it means ""Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale"" (Financial Cooperation in Central Africa).

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean prosecutors are investigating an incident in which a 20-year-old protester was allegedly run over by a police vehicle during a protest in the capital on Friday evening.
Footage recorded by local television stations showed two police riot vehicles surrounded by a large crowd of protesters in Santiago's Plaza Italia, a central rallying point in recent weeks, before the incident took place.
The protest came after more than two months of fierce demonstrations against the government of President Sebastian Pinera over endemic inequality in the southern Latin nation, previously regarded as one of the region´s most stable.
The young man was named by local media as Oscar Ignacio Pérez Cortéz. He was being treated in a private hospital for a suspected fractured pelvis, local newspaper El Mercurio reported.
A police officer was due to appear before a court in central Santiago for a preliminary hearing on grevious bodily harm charges, the regional prosecutor confirmed to Reuters.
The superintendent of Metropolitan Province, which includes Santiago, said the images of the accident ""leaves no one indifferent.""
""As a government and especially as governor, I deeply regret what happened and send our best wishes to him and his family,"" superintendent Felipe Guevara said on Twitter.
Earlier in the week, Guevara said there would be ""zero tolerance"" for unauthorized demonstrations in Santiago.

In the southern region of Andalusia, a spokesman for the emergency services said they had recovered the body of a windsurfer in the province of Huelva, and a second man died in Granada attempting to ford a swollen river in his car.
In Madrid a woman died on Saturday after being injured by a piece of falling masonry dislodged by strong winds in the city center on Friday.
The arrival of Storm Fabien on Saturday brought a fresh round of high winds and heavy rainfall to the region, just as Storm Elsa, which hit the Iberian peninsula on Wednesday, began to subside.
Spain's civil defense agency said the latest front could bring winds of up to 140 km per hour (85 mph) and waves of up to 9 meters (30 feet), to the country's northwest Atlantic coast.
However, the effects of the storms have been felt across the peninsula.
On Friday a person died in a landslide in Asturias, a second was killed when a stone wall crumbled in Galicia and a third person was swept away by floodwaters in Castile and Leon, a government spokeswoman said.
In Portugal, one man died in Montijo, near Lisbon, on Thursday after a tree fell on his truck, and a second man was killed in Castro Daire, northern Portugal, when his house collapsed, officials said.
Portugal's civil protection authority said on Saturday the heavy rain and strong winds had felled trees and caused flooding and damage to infrastructure.
More than 250 people were evacuated from their homes in villages in central Portugal on Saturday due to rising river waters, Portuguese news agency Lusa said.
EDP, the country's largest utility, said on Friday that thousands of people were without electricity due to storm damage."

Security Council resolution to block cross-border aid deliveries from Turkey and Iraq to millions of Syrian civilians.
""The Russian Federation’s and China’s veto yesterday of a Security Council resolution that allows for humanitarian aid to reach millions of Syrians is shameful,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
""To Russia and China, who have chosen to make a political statement by opposing this resolution, you have blood on your hands,"" he added.
Russia, backed by China, on Friday cast its 14th U.N. Security Council veto since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.
The resolution, drafted by Belgium, Kuwait and Germany, would have allowed cross-border humanitarian deliveries for a further 12 months from two points in Turkey and one in Iraq. But Syrian ally Russia only wanted to approve the two Turkish crossings for six months and had proposed its own draft text.
Russia and China vetoed the text while the remaining 13 members of the Security Council voted in favor. A resolution needs a minimum nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France to pass.
""The United States will remain committed to helping the voiceless, the hungry, the displaced, and the orphaned receive the humanitarian aid they require to survive no matter where they live,"" Pompeo said.
Since 2014 the United Nations and aid groups have crossed into Syria from Turkey, Iraq and Jordan at four places annually authorized by the Security Council. In a bid to compromise with Russia, the Jordan crossing was dropped by Belgium, Kuwait and Germany from their draft.
The current authorization for the four border crossings in Turkey, Iraq and Jordan ends on Jan. 10, so the Security Council could still attempt to reach an agreement, though some diplomats acknowledged this could now be difficult.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Five people suspected of burning down four mosques in Ethiopia's Amhara region were arrested on Saturday, a regional spokesman said, as rising inter-communal and ethnic violence threatens political reforms initiated by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
""Five people who are suspected of leading and organizing the attacks have now been arrested,"" Getnet Yirsaw, the Amhara state spokesman, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
Yirsaw also said that a church in the town of Motta, 377 km (234 miles) north of the capital Addis Ababa, had been targeted in an arson attack. It was unclear who was responsible for that attack.
The president of Amhara's regional Islamic council said the attack in Motta was unexpected and that businesses owned by Muslims had also been burnt and vandalized.
Abiy has introduced sweeping political and economic reforms, which have won him international praise, culminating in the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for peacemaking efforts with long-time enemy Eritrea. But the reforms have also stoked ethnic and religious tensions as regional strongmen have been emboldened to compete over influence and resources.
Abiy condemned the violence on Saturday and said he would not allow extremists to tarnish Ethiopia's history of religious tolerance. He urged called on citizens to reject hateful agendas.
The International Crisis Group think-tank warned in a report published this week of an uptick in attacks on churches across Ethiopia and suggested that rising inter-communal tensions pose a threat ahead of elections scheduled for May 2020."

TIRANA (Reuters) - Western Balkan leaders met on Saturday to advance EU-supported plans for free movement of people and goods in their region to boost trade and investment.
The leaders of Montenegro, Serbia, North Macedonia and Albania met in the Albanian capital Tirana for their third meeting to give shape to the idea.
All Western Balkan countries, blighted by wars in the 1990s, aspire to join the European Union, but their accession has been slowed down by Brexit and lack of domestic reforms.
Serbia and Montenegro are already negotiating EU membership while Albania and North Macedonia's accession talks were put on hold in October.
""We cannot survive without this because we are small and insignificant if we do not increase our labor and economic markets,"" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told reporters after the discussions.
""We shall be trying to create a joint labor market that means comparatively a higher level of attraction for foreign investors.""
Serbs, North Macedonians and Albanians could work in each other's countries given labor shortages, and align rules to create a market of up to 12 million people, he said.
Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the European Union supported the plan.
""The (EU) Commission is readying grants of 1.2 billion euros to our countries to help us implement our accords,"" Rama said.
Lifting barriers and border checkpoints would speed cross-border trade and allow foreign tourists to cross the region without waiting at frontiers, the leaders said.
""If Chinese tourists land at Belgrade airport, they should be able to cross freely in all the countries of the region,"" said Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of North Macedonia.
The West Balkan region is already part of the CEFTA free trade deal and the Berlin Process backed by big EU economies.
""This is CEFTA-plus, and Berlin-plus, something we can do together and that our citizens will feel,"" Zaev said.
President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro added: ""Every regional move should help create a dynamic progress to get our countries into the European Union as soon as possible.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is ""very concerned"" about the intensification of the conflict in Libya, with a rising number of reported Russian mercenaries supporting Khalifa Haftar's forces on the ground turning the conflict into a bloodier one, a senior State Department official said on Saturday.
The United States continues to recognize the Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Fayez al-Serraj, the official said, but added that Washington is not taking sides in the conflict and is talking to all stakeholders who could be influential in trying to forge an agreement.
""We are very concerned about the military intensification,"" the official told Reuters. ""We see the Russians using hybrid warfare, using drones and aircraft...This isn't good.""
""With the increased numbers of reported Wagner forces and mercenaries on the ground, we think it's changing the landscape of the conflict and intensifying it,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to a shadowy group of mercenaries known as Wagner.
Libya has been divided since 2014 into rival military and political camps based in the capital Tripoli and the east. Serraj's government is in conflict with forces led by Khalifa Haftar based in eastern Libya.
Haftar is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and most recently Russian mercenaries, according to diplomats and Tripoli officials. The issue has come up in a meeting earlier this month between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
Pompeo said there could be no military solution to the fighting and that Washington had warned countries against sending weapons to Libya, adding that he reminded Lavrov specifically of the U.N. arms embargo on Libya.
Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) has been trying since April to take Tripoli. Earlier this month, he announced what he said would be the ""final battle"" for the capital but has not made much advance.
The U.S. official said the involvement of Russian mercenaries so far has not tipped the conflict in favor of Haftar. ""It's creating a bloodier conflict...more civilian damage, damage to infrastructure like the airports..hospitals have been targeted. But at the same time we don't see that Haftar is gaining ground.""
TURKEY AGREEMENT WITH LIBYA 'PROVOCATIVE' 
Turkey has backed Libya's internationally recognized government led by Fayez al-Serraj and the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on maritime cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean as well as a security agreement which could deepen military cooperation between them.
In a first reaction from the United States on the agreements between Turkey and Libya, the U.S. official said the maritime MOU was ""unhelpful"" and ""provocative.""
""Because it's drawing into the Libyan conflict interests that up until now had not been involved in the situation in Libya,' the official said. ""With maritime boundaries, you're drawing in Greece and Cyprus...from the United States' perspective, this is a concern…it's not the time to be provoking more instability in the Mediterranean,"" the official said.
Ankara has already sent military supplies to Libya in violation of a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month. Its maritime agreement with Libya enraged Greece and drew ire from the European Union.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey could deploy troops to Libya in support of the GNA but no request has yet been made.

The raid about 150 km (90 miles) northwest of Mopti in Mali targeted the same forest area where France wrongly claimed last year it had killed Amadou Koufa, one of the most senior Islamist militants being hunted by French forces in the Sahel.
A spokesman for the French army's chief of staff declined to say at this stage whether Koufa was the target this time.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced the operation in a speech to the French community in Ivory Coast's main city of Abidjan, describing it as a major success.
""This morning ... we were able to neutralise 33 terrorists, take one prisoner and free two Malian gendarmes who had been held hostage,"" Macron said on Saturday, a day after visiting French troops stationed in Ivory Coast.
The operation took place in a different part of Mali to where 13 French soldiers died last month in a helicopter crash while tracking a militant group suspected of being linked to Islamic State.
That was the biggest loss of French troops in a day since an attack in Beirut 36 years ago and raised questions about the human cost to France of its six-year campaign against Islamist insurgents in West Africa.
In Saturday's raid, soldiers aboard Tiger attack helicopters used a Reaper drone to guide them to the forest area where Koufa's group Katiba Macina operates, French army command said.
Koufa is one of the top deputies to Iyad Ag Ghali, the leader of Mali's most prominent jihadi group, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), which has repeatedly attacked soldiers and civilians in Mali and neighbouring Burkina Faso. 
The United Nations, France and the United States have poured billions of dollars into stabilising the Sahel, an arid region of West Africa below the Sahara desert, but with little success.
France, the former colonial power in a number of West African countries, has more than 4,000 soldiers in the region in its counter-terrorism taskforce Operation Barkhane. The United Nations has a 13,000-strong peacekeeping operation in Mali.
French officials have expressed frustration that some countries in the region have not done more to curb criticism of its interventions. Paris is also vexed that some countries have not fully implemented deals to bring more stability to areas of the Sahel with little law and order. 
Islamist militants killed 71 soldiers at a remote military camp in Niger near the border with Mali, an attack claimed by a West African branch of Islamic State.

France announced separately this week that its Reaper drones deployed in the Sahel would now have the capacity to carry arms, although the army command said the drone used in Saturday's operation did not fire any weapons.

Friction between Tehran and Washington has increased since last year when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six nations and re-imposed sanctions on the country, crippling its economy.
Washington proposed the naval mission after several attacks in May and June on international merchant vessels, including Saudi tankers, in Gulf waters which the United States blamed on Iran. Tehran denies the accusations.
In July, Iranian forces seized a British tanker in the Gulf after British marines captured an Iranian vessel in the Strait of Gibraltar. Both ships were later released.
""Japan has announced it will not take part in the Americans' plans for security in the (Gulf) region ... which is something we welcome,"" Rouhani said on state TV after returning from a visit to Malaysia and Japan. 
""Japan is sending a surveillance vessel but not to the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz,"" he said.
Rouhani said his discussions in Japan included ways of ""breaking"" the U.S. sanctions.
""On breaking the sanctions, the Japanese had a new proposal and we also had a new proposal and we discussed this and it was decided to continue the consultations between the two countries on this issue,"" Rouhani said, without giving details.
Following his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Rouhani tweeted on Friday: ""I welcome any effort that could boost economic exchanges, especially in the energy sector, and increase oil exports.""
A Japanese official who gave a briefing to reporters said crude oil purchases were not discussed at the summit meeting. Japan was a leading buyer of Iranian oil for decades before the U.S.-led sanctions.
Japan, a U.S. ally maintaining friendly ties with Iran, is looking to launch its own naval operation rather than joining the U.S.-led mission to protect shipping in the region.
The planned Japanese operation is set to cover high seas in the Gulf of Oman, the northern Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden, but not the Strait of Hormuz. 
According to a draft plan approved by parties in the ruling coalition, Japan will deploy a destroyer and a patrol aircraft for gathering information in the Gulf region - which has been the source of nearly 90 percent of Japan's crude oil imports.

A European operation to ensure safe shipping in the Gulf will get underway next month when a French warship starts patrolling there. The French government has pushed for a European security alternative after ruling out taking part in the U.S.-led mission.

MEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Business ties between former U.S. officials and an ex-Mexican security minister charged with taking bribes from a drug cartel have raised questions about what U.S. law enforcement knew about him before his arrest this month.
A former U.S. official who once headed the FBI's office in Mexico and a senior ex-CIA officer worked as recently as last year with the accused Genaro Garcia Luna, one of the principal architects of Mexico's 13-year war on drug cartels.
Raul Roldan, who was the FBI's chief representative at the U.S. embassy in Mexico when the Mexican led national police, was among several U.S., Spanish and Colombian law enforcement veterans who appear in brochures as board members at Garcia Luna's security company GLAC Consulting until last year.
""(Garcia Luna) had a very close relationship for many years with U.S. intelligence,"" said Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope. ""If he did what they say he did, that is a harsh sentence on all the verification mechanisms of U.S. intelligence.""
Garcia Luna was arrested in Dallas last week and charged with three counts of cocaine trafficking, and allowing the Sinaloa Cartel to operate with impunity in Mexico.
The 51-year-old Garcia Luna, who lived in Florida before his arrest, pleaded not guilty to the charges. A U.S. judge this week ordered him to remain held without bond.
Roldan declined to comment for this article.
Jose Rodriguez, a former director of the CIA's clandestine service, who served with Roldan at GLAC until at least 2018, said all members on what he described as its advisory board had done due diligence before joining the firm as unpaid advisers.
""Those of us who know Garcia Luna are shocked by his recent arrest,"" Rodriguez said in a statement to Reuters, adding that a former head of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Operations recently spoke highly of Garcia Luna's integrity.
Rodriguez said GLAC's board met four times, starting in 2016, and gave advice on a data product developed by Garcia Luna to calculate business risks in Mexico.
Garcia Luna spearheaded former President Felipe Calderon's military-led crackdown on drug cartels launched in late 2006. Violence has only increased since then, and the flow of drugs to the United States continued largely unabated.
The arrest of Garcia Luna caused a shock in Mexico, though he had long had detractors. Critics alleged the Calderon administration was more lenient on the Sinaloa Cartel than other gangs, based on arrest numbers. Calderon denies this.
When Garcia Luna left office in 2012, magazine Proceso published a report pointing to his possible ties to cartels.
During the trial of Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman last year, a senior gang member testified he had paid Garcia Luna millions of dollars in bribes. A witness in another trial last year also testified to his cartel links.
Garcia Luna denied the allegations.
Rodriguez said he was assured by friends in the law enforcement community that there were ""no derogatory conclusions"" about the former Mexican official.
Garcia Luna, who had permanent residency in the United States, also won awards from U.S. law enforcement for his work.
""I was certain that these agencies would not have recognized him if they believed he was corrupt,"" Rodriguez said.
Security expert Hope said that given the accusations, U.S. security services must have reviewed Garcia Luna's application for residency carefully.
The DEA referred questions about the involvement of former U.S. officials with Garcia Luna to the Eastern District of New York, where the case is being heard.

The FBI, CIA and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Turkey has been backing the Libyan government led by Fayez al-Serraj as it fights off a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces based in the east of the country.
Ankara has already sent military supplies to Libya in violation of a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month.
The two sides signed the deal in November to boost military cooperation along with a separate accord on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean that has enraged Greece.
The state-run Anadolu news agency said on Saturday that Turkey's parliament voted 269-125 in favour of the security accord after Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) ratified it on Thursday.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey could deploy troops to Libya in support of the GNA but no request has yet been made. He said on Friday that Turkey could not remain silent over Russian-backed mercenaries backing Haftar's forces.
Russia said it was very concerned about the possibility of Turkey deploying troops in Libya and that the security deal raised many questions for Moscow.
Erdogan will discuss Ankara's potential troop deployment to Libya with Russian President Vladimir Putin during talks in Turkey next month, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.
Speaking on Saturday, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said the accords with Libya were historic for Turkey and added Ankara was ready to evaluate possible troop deployment.
Ankara and Tripoli have also ratified the accord on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, a move which prompted Greece to expel the Libyan ambassador to Athens and escalated tensions in the region. Ankara and Athens have been at odds over resources off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus.

""The law should take its course and we will obviously be following that case with keen interest and continuing to make representations on behalf of Harry Dunn's family in the U.S. at every level,"" Johnson said.
He was speaking to British broadcasters during a visit to Estonia.
British prosecutors said on Friday they would charge Anne Sacoolas with causing death by dangerous driving and seek her extradition over the crash in August in which Dunn was killed while riding his motorbike.
Sacoolas' lawyer said her client would not return voluntarily to Britain to face a potential jail sentence for ""a terrible but unintentional accident"".
Johnson has previously said he wants Sacoolas to return to Britain and that she was wrong to use diplomatic immunity to leave.
Dunn's parents met U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in October. Trump hoped to persuade them meet to Sacoolas, who was in the building at the same time, but they declined."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong riot police swept into several shopping malls on Saturday, chasing off and arresting some anti-government Hong Kong demonstrators who had gathered to press their demands in the peak shopping weekend before Christmas.
In a mall in Yuen Long, close to the China border, hundreds of black-clad protesters marked the five-month anniversary of an attack in a train station by an armed mob wearing white T-shirts which beat up bystanders and protesters with pipes and poles. 
Police have been criticized for not responding quickly enough to calls for help, and for not arresting any alleged culprits at the scene. They later made several arrests and said the assailants had links to organized criminal gangs, or triads.
The protesters demanded justice for the attack, shouting ""Fight for Freedom"" and ""Stand With Hong Kong"".
""The government didn't do anything so far after 5 months ... I deserve an answer, an explanation,"" said a 30-year-old clerk surnamed Law.
""Yuen Long is no longer a safe place ... and we all live in white terror when we worry if we will be beaten up when dressed in black."" 
As dozens of riot police stormed into the mall to chase protesters off, a sushi restaurant had its window smashed and shops were forced to close. 
Protests in Hong Kong are now in their seventh month, albeit in a relative lull. Residents are angry at what they see as China's meddling in the city's freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
Many are also outraged by perceived police brutality, and are demanding an independent investigation into allegations of excessive force. Other demands include the release of all arrested demonstrators and full democracy.
On Friday night, police arrested a man who fired a single shot with a pistol at plain clothes officers in the northern Tai Po district. No one was injured. 
A search of a nearby flat revealed a cache of weaponry including a semi-automatic rifle and bullets. Steve Li, a senior police officer on the scene, told reporters the police had information that the suspect planned to use the pistol during a protest to ""cause chaos and to hurt police officers.""
In Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday, groups of protesters also converged on a mall popular with mainland Chinese luxury shoppers.

""We can't celebrate Christmas when our city is taken over by the police. When you see the police outside the mall, do you feel like shopping for presents?"" said Bob, 17, a protester.

The decree, which is expected to be approved in a cabinet meeting on Saturday, says that state-owned roadway company ANAS will temporarily manage motorways if an operator is sacked.
It also considerably reduces the amounts the government must pay to a toll road company if a concession is revoked due to shortcomings on the part of the operator.
The ruling 5-Star Movement has repeatedly blamed Atlantia, a company controlled by the Benetton family, for the collapse of a Genoa bridge which killed 43 people in 2018.
Atlantia has denied any wrongdoing and said it carried out maintenance of the bridge as required by the contract.
The decree does not mention Atlantia, but a government source told Reuters that the measures could be applied to it.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said this month a decision on whether to revoke Atlantia's motorway concession would be taken by the end of the year.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - More than 1,500 protesters have been arrested across India in the past 10 days, officials said, as police try to quell sometimes violent demonstrations against a citizenship law that critics say undermines the country's secular constitution.
Additionally, some 4,000 people have been detained and then released, the officials said.
Those arrested and detained had been resorting to violence during the protests, said two senior federal government officials overseeing the country's internal security who spoke on condition of anonymity.
At least 19 people have been killed in clashes between police and protesters since parliament passed the law on Dec. 11. Critics of the law say it discriminates against Muslims and threatens India's secular ethos because it makes religion a criteria for citizenship.
The law aims to grant citizenship to minorities of the Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Sikh, Jain and Parsi faiths from Muslim-majority Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, deemed as suffering persecution there. The applicant should have entered India on or before Dec. 31, 2014.
Hundreds of protesters and police have been injured in the protests, the strongest show of dissent against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government since he was first elected in 2014.
Modi met his council of ministers on Saturday to discuss security measures related to the protests, government sources said.
Demonstrations continued on Saturday despite curfews and tough measures aimed at shutting down the protests.
India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, has seen the worst violence with nine people killed and several more in critical conditions in hospital. The state, which has long seen clashes between majority Hindus and minority Muslims, is ruled by Modi's nationalist party.
Rights activists in the state said police had raided their houses and offices to prevent them from planning fresh demonstrations. Authorities also shut schools across the state as fresh protests erupted on Saturday.
More demonstrations were planned in several parts of the country, including in the northeastern state of Assam. Resentment against illegal immigrants from Bangladesh has simmered for years in Assam, one of India's poorest states, where some residents accuse outsiders, Hindus or Muslims, of stealing jobs and land.
""Women in Assam have shown that we can lead a movement from the front,"" Garima Garg, a fashion designer, told Reuters. She was among thousands who took part in an all-woman protest across Assam on Saturday.
Critics of the law say it has struck a blow to a country that has long taken pride in its secular constitution. India has a population of 1.3 billion, with a majority of Hindus, a large minority of Muslims and several other smaller faiths.
""This piece of legislation strikes at the heart of the Constitution, seeking to make India another country altogether,"" prominent historian Ramachandra Guha wrote in The Telegraph.
He was released from police custody on Thursday after being detained for protesting against the law in the southern city of Bengaluru.
Political opposition against the law has included state leaders from regional parties saying they will prevent its implementation in their states. The government has said there is no chance the law will be repealed.
On Saturday, right-wing Hindu organizations and academicians expressed support for the law. Over 1,000 professors and scholars congratulated the parliament and government for what they said was a progressive law standing up for forgotten minorities. 

""We also note with deep anguish that an atmosphere of fear and paranoia is being created in the country through deliberate obfuscation and fear-mongering, leading to violence in several parts of the country,” they said in a statement.

In 2013, Junaid Hafeez was accused by students at the university where he taught of making blasphemous Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts. Insulting Islam's Prophet Mohammad carries a mandatory death penalty in Pakistan, which is about 95% Muslim.
His lawyers say he was framed by students from an extremist Islamist party for his liberal and secular views and this month a U.S. religious freedom commission placed Hafeez on its list of global victims.
""He (Junaid Hafeez) shall be hanged by neck till his death subject to its confirmation by the honorable high court,"" a court order stated.
His defense lawyer Asad Jamal said he would appeal against the ruling in a higher court.
""There can't be a fair trial in blasphemy cases in Pakistan,"" Jamal told Reuters. ""We have a spineless system. No one can stand up to a blasphemy charge.""
Hafeez, who quit his studies at Pakistan's top medical college to pursue a passion for art and literature, secured a Fulbright scholarship and attended Jackson State University where he majored in American literature, photography and theater.
The trial was held in a prison in the central Pakistan city of Multan under tight security due to threats to Hafeez's family and his lawyer."

Darryn Frost, who appeared in video footage of the fight between the attacker and members of the public on London Bridge on Nov. 29, told the PA newswire that he was attending an event in a building nearby when he heard a disturbance downstairs.
The 38-year-old said he grabbed the narwhal tusk that was mounted on a wall while another man used a wooden chair to fend off the attacker, Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist who had been released early from prison.
""He had knives in both hands and, upon seeing me with the narwhal tusk, pointed at his midriff,"" said Frost, a government worker who moved to Britain from South Africa 14 years go.
""He turned and spoke to me, then indicated he had an explosive device around his waist. At this point, the man next to me threw his chair at the attacker, who then started running toward him with knives raised above his head.""
Frost told PA he passed the tusk to the man who had thrown the chair and ran upstairs to get another one. On his return, he saw the first tusk shattered on the floor and people fleeing.
""Along with others, I pursued the attacker, tusk in hand, on to the bridge,"" he said.
""We called out to warn the public of the danger and, after a struggle, managed to restrain him to the ground. At that point I was trying to isolate the blades by holding his wrists so that he could not hurt anyone or set off the device.""
Police shot Khan dead moments later. The vest was found to have been a fake.
Two people died from stab wounds, namely Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, both former students active in a program on prisoner rehabilitation.
Frost said he had launched a project, Extinguish Hate, and he asked people to donate to the victims' fundraising pages: saskia-jones.muchloved.com and the ""Celebration of the life of Jack Merritt"" on GoFundMe.com."

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea lashed back at the United States for taking issue with its human rights record on Saturday, saying Washington's ""malicious words"" would only aggravate tensions on the Korean Peninsula, state news agency KCNA reported. 
The KCNA statement, attributed to a foreign ministry spokesperson, warned that if the United States dared to take issue with the North's system of government by citing human rights problems, it would ""pay dearly"". 
The United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday condemned North Korea's ""long-standing and ongoing"" violations of human rights in an annual resolution sponsored by dozens of countries including the United States, that Pyongyang's U.N. envoy rejected.
The North Korean Foreign Ministry statement is its first since U.S. special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, publicly urged Pyongyang on Monday to return to talks. There has been no direct response from North Korea to Biegun's entreaty.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Friday that he remains hopeful the United States can restart diplomacy with North Korea, as the clock ticks down to North Korea's declared year-end deadline for new U.S. concessions in talks over its nuclear arsenal.
North Korea has repeatedly called for the United States to drop its ""hostile policy"" before more talks. 
But tension has been rising in recent weeks as Pyongyang has conducted a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Some experts say the reclusive state may be preparing for an intercontinental ballistic missile test that could put it back on a path of confrontation with the United States.

She and her parents survived, but her two sisters were killed on that fateful day on Dec. 26, 2004.Fifteen years on, she frequently relives the traumatic events when recounting her story to visitors at the Aceh Tsunami Museum, where she works as a guide.
In doing so, she hopes to spread the lessons learned from her heartbreaking experience - such as the importance of early warning systems and fleeing to higher ground when an alarm is raised or if there is an earthquake. 
""Since I'd experienced the trauma of tsunami, when I meet visitors I share my experiences... so that they will never forget,"" said the 44-year-old. The museum where she works, built to commemorate the disaster, also has an education center and acts as a disaster shelter.

Northern Aceh province bore the brunt of the disaster, where a total of 128,858 were killed and another 37,087 are still listed as missing, according to data compiled by the government and aid agencies.
Many lost their lives simply because there was little information on what to do.

The Popular Will party, known for its hardline approach to seeking to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, said a special forces police unit known as FAES detained lawmaker Gilber Caro and one of his assistants in Caracas.
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and it was not immediately clear what charges, if any, Caro faced.
Earlier this week, the government approved a trial of four opposition lawmakers accused of committing crimes including treason and conspiracy. Guaido says some 30 lawmakers remain detained, in exile, or in refuge at embassies in Caracas.
""There is no doubt that this new attack is part of the regime's operation to dismantle parliament and torpedo President Juan Guaido's election on Jan. 5,"" Popular Will said in a statement on Twitter about Caro's detention.
Guaido in January invoked Venezuela's constitution to assume a rival presidency, arguing Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate, and was swiftly backed by dozens of countries including the United States.
His allies say the government is intimidating lawmakers to try to prevent him from winning re-election next month to his post as congress chief, on which his claim to the interim president is based.
Maduro dismisses Guaido as a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.
Caro had previously been detained twice in recent years. He spent a year and a half in jail after being arrested in January 2017 after Maduro said he was planning to carry out ""terrorist attacks."" The government released him in what it called a peace gesture.
He was arrested again in April of this year, days ahead of a failed attempt by Guaido to spur a military uprising. He was released in June ahead of a visit by U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet."

Authorities asked people to delay travel, at the start of what is normally a busy Christmas holiday period, warning of the unpredictability of the fires as winds of up to 70 kph (44 mph) were set to fan flames through the middle of the day.
""Catastrophic fire conditions are as bad as it gets,"" NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told journalists.
""They are the very worst of conditions. Given we have a landscape with so much active fire burning, you have a recipe for very serious concern and a very dangerous day.""
Greater Sydney and two surrounding areas were rated as catastrophic for Saturday, and other areas were at extreme or very-high fire danger ratings.
Close to 10,000 emergency personnel would be working across NSW on Saturday, which the NSW Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott said was likely the largest emergency deployment the state had ever seen.
""They're there, four days before Christmas, to keep families safe,"" Elliott told media.
A southerly wind change is expected late on Saturday afternoon. It is forecast to bring winds of up to 90 kph (56 mph), which Fitzsimmons said would initially worsen fire conditions before leading to a dramatic drop in temperatures.
The Gospers Mountain mega fire, which has already burned almost 450,000 hectares (1.1 million acres) to the northwest of Sydney was upgraded to emergency status early on Saturday.
The death of two firefighters on Thursday night when their fire truck was struck by a falling tree as it traveled through the front line of a fire brought the wildfires death toll in New South Wales to eight since the start of October.
Shortly after the two deaths were announced, Prime Minister Scott Morrison issued a statement saying he would return as soon as possible from a family holiday in Hawaii, a trip that had drawn sharp criticism as the wildfires crisis deepened.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A conservative U.S. activist has teamed up with a prominent Venezuelan evangelical pastor to bring a $500,000 humanitarian aid shipment to the crisis-stricken country, the two men said in interviews this week. 
Randy Brinson, an Alabama-based gastroenterologist who also runs a voter-registration nonprofit, said the delivery of two shipping containers filled with medicine and ready-to-eat meals would arrive in January thanks to a deal brokered by the pastor, Javier Bertucci, with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government. 
Bertucci challenged Maduro in a May 2018 vote boycotted by mainstream opposition leaders who called it a sham meant to legitimize a dictatorship. He was also among politicians from small political parties who inked a deal with Maduro earlier this year to try to end the country's deep political crisis.
That group has criticized Trump administration sanctions intended to force out Maduro and promoted aid efforts in the once-prosperous OPEC nation, where six years of economic contraction have prompted millions to emigrate and led to growing child malnutrition.
The opposition parties who hold a majority in Venezuela's congress say the political deal reached by Bertucci and others with the government ignores the will of most Venezuelans, who want Maduro gone. 
""No matter what the political outlook is, we've got to find a way to save lives within Venezuela,"" Brinson, who plans to spend the weekend in Venezuela, said by phone. ""To criticize someone finding a way to get food and medicine to the people is not advantageous at all."" 
Brinson, who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate seat in Alabama formerly occupied by ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, heads up a nonprofit called Redeem the Vote, which he founded in 2006 to register religious U.S. voters. He said he previously worked on humanitarian relief efforts in Zambia, Congo and Honduras. 
Bertucci said in a Thursday interview that the aid will be distributed through a network of doctors and volunteers he works with across the country. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Opposition politicians - whose leader, Juan Guaido, is recognized by the Trump administration and dozens of other governments as Venezuela's legitimate president - have accused authorities of using food and medicine distribution for political purposes. 
Brinson described this shipment as a trial run, and said he had preliminary plans for two larger shipments if the delivery is successful.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia, backed by China, on Friday cast its 14th U.N. Security Council veto since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011 to block cross-border aid deliveries from Turkey and Iraq to millions of Syrian civilians.
The resolution, drafted by Belgium, Kuwait and Germany, would have allowed cross-border humanitarian deliveries for a further 12 months from two points in Turkey and one in Iraq. But Syrian ally Russia only wanted to approve the two Turkish crossings for six months and had proposed its own draft text.
Russia and China vetoed the text while the remaining 13 members of the Security Council voted in favor. A resolution needs a minimum nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France to pass.
U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the council after the Russia and China vetoes that she was in a state of shock, saying the consequences ""will be disastrous."" She described Russia and China's opposition as ""reckless, irresponsible and cruel.""
The council then voted on the rival Russian draft resolution that would have approved the two Turkish crossing points for six months, but it failed with only five votes in favor, six against and four abstentions. 
""Who won today? Nobody. Who lost? The Syrian people,"" Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told the council. He had argued that the humanitarian situation in Syria has improved dramatically and that the council had to recognize that change.
""Do not attempt to shift blame for this on us,"" he said. 
Deputy U.N. aid chief Ursula Mueller had warned the council on Thursday that without the cross border operations ""we would see an immediate end of aid supporting millions of civilians.""
""That would cause a rapid increase in hunger and disease, resulting in death, suffering and further displacement - including across borders - for a vulnerable population who have already suffered unspeakable tragedy as a result of almost nine years of conflict,"" Mueller said.
Since 2014 the United Nations and aid groups have crossed into Syria from Turkey, Iraq and Jordan at four places annually authorized by the Security Council. In a bid to compromise with Russia, the Jordan crossing was dropped by Belgium, Kuwait and Germany from their draft.
The current authorization for the four border crossings in Turkey, Iraq and Jordan ends on Jan. 10, so the Security Council could still attempt to reach an agreement, though some diplomats acknowledged this could now be difficult. 
In a Dec. 16 report to the council, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the council to extend authorization of the cross-border deliveries.
""We very much hope a solution can be found in the days ahead,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Friday. 
Russia has vetoed 14 council resolutions on Syria since a crackdown by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war. Islamic State militants then used the chaos to seize territory in Syria and Iraq.
Indonesia's U.N. ambassador, Dian Triansyah Djani, told the council on Thursday: ""The world is watching. The international community is watching. But we are not here to just watch ... we are here to help and take action ... It is not about us. It is all about saving Syrian people on the ground.""

""Mesut Ozil's honorable behavior inspired us... Everybody should raise their voice against this tyrant like Mesut did,"" Adem Adil said, a protester marching with the crowd.
Turkey has in the past expressed concern about the situation in Xinjiang, including in February at the U.N. Human Rights Council, but has not commented over the Ozil affair.
At the Kuala Lumpur summit on Thursday, a question from the audience on the treatment of Uighurs was ignored after it was put to a dais that included Erdogan, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
Last Saturday, club Arsenal tried to distance itself from his comments, saying it always adhered to the principle of not being involved in politics.

Ozil has received support from former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who defended the player's right to express his opinion.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's prime minister designate said he would work to form a government within six weeks to help pull the country out of a deepening economic crisis, dismissing accusations he would be dominated by the powerful Iranian backed-Hezbollah movement.
Hassan Diab, an academic and former education minister, was designated on Thursday as the next prime minister with the support of the heavily armed Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah, Lebanon's most influential group, and its allies.
""Previous governments in the last decade took a year to form and I seek to form a government in the next four weeks or a period that does not exceed six weeks,"" Diab said in an interview with Deutsche Welle.
On Friday night, troops fired tear gas in Beirut to disperse hundreds of youths who were protesting against Diab's designation, witnesses said.
The protesters threw rocks and fireworks at the soldiers in clashes in the streets of the Corniche al Mazzraa district. Many of the youths set tyres and fires broke out in several streets.
The designation set the stage for a cabinet without allies of the United States and Sunni Gulf Arab states while underlining the sway of Iran's friends. The move will complicate efforts to secure Western financial aid, analysts say.
Lebanon, in its worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war, has been seeking a new government since Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri resigned on Oct. 29 in response to protests against a ruling elite seen as venal and incompetent.
Efforts to reach a deal on a new premier have been hurt by rifts that reflect tensions between Hariri, who is aligned with the West and Gulf Arab states, and Hezbollah. Washington sees Hezbollah as a terrorist group and has imposed sanctions on it.
Hariri was quoted in an interview with Lebanon's MTV channel as saying ""one has to brace for the worst.""
Senior U.S. State Department official David Hale, who arrived on Friday to underline Washington's support for Lebanon's stability, urged the bickering political leaders to implement speedy economic reforms.
""PARTISAN INTERESTS""
""It's time to put aside partisan interests and act in the national interest, advancing reforms and form a government committed to undertaking these reforms and capable of doing so,"" said Hale said after meeting President Michel Aoun.
He later met parliament speaker Nabih Berri and had lunch with Hariri.
Washington, which Hezbollah accuses of inciting some protesters, was not meddling in Lebanon's politics, Hale said.
Aoun told Hale the new government had ""many tasks ahead"" of it and said peaceful protesters were being protected by the army to safeguard freedom of speech. 
Since the protests broke out, there have been several attacks by supporters of Shi'ite groups Hezbollah and Amal against anti-government demonstrators in a square in Beirut. Security forces have intervened to prevent the attacks from escalating amid fears of wider clashes. 
Analysts say Diab faced obstacles due to his reliance on Hezbollah's support and a lack of real support from his Sunni sect or the protest movement.
""Diab is already presented as a pro-Hezbollah PM which kills any possibility to get the international financial aid which is the only chance to get out of the crisis,"" said Sami Nader, head of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs.
Diab, who failed to win's Hariri's support under a sectarian political system that leaves the premiership to a Sunni Muslim, dismissed accusations that the government would be under Hezbollah's thumb. Hariri is Lebanon's main Sunni politician. 
""This matter is silly because the new government will not be a government of a political grouping chosen from here or there,"" Diab added.

At the protest, taking place at the end of the school term in Sweden, activists presented a report card giving politicians an F for ""failed"" in tackling climate change at UN-led summits over the past decade and the verdict ""Needs to try harder!"".
Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swede whose solo ""School Strike for the Climate"" outside parliament, begun in August 2018, swelled into the global Fridays for Future movement, took a low profile as other activists spoke.
""I would give them an F, actually. I know they did try, but they didn't try hard enough,"" activist Isabelle Axelsson, 18, told Reuters of politicians' work on climate change this year.
Axelsson said she thought Fridays for Future deserved an A for effort, but added: ""We haven't accomplished convincing our politicians to act on climate, so I don't think we should pass either, really.""
In 2020, weekly school strikes and larger protests aimed at persuading politicians to act would continue, she said.
Fridays for Future has seen millions of young people in more than 100 countries walk out of school on Fridays this year in support of Thunberg's demands for urgent action from governments to curb carbon emissions.
After crisscrossing the globe by car, train and boat -- but not plane -- to demand action on climate change, Thunberg said as she was returning home from the COP25 climate summit in Madrid this week that she would take a break. [nL8N28N3GC]"

MADRID (Reuters) - Jailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared in a Madrid court via videolink from Britain on Friday as part of an investigation into his allegations that a Spanish firm spied on him while he lived inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
The case, led by Spanish judge Jose de la Mata, focuses on allegations that first cameras and then microphones were installed in the embassy between June 2017 and early 2018 by Spanish private security firm Undercover Global S.L.
An Ecuador foreign ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the case.
The recordings, said to have captured conversations between Assange and his lawyers, may have been distributed to parties including ""authorities from Ecuador and agents from the United States,"" according to court documents, which say this was done ""probably on orders from U.S. intelligence.""
A CIA spokeswoman declined to comment.
""Finally Mr. Assange will be able to testify as a victim of this alleged spying plot which would have been orchestrated from the United States,"" said Aitor Martinez, a lawyer for Assange, who testified as a witness in the case.
During his testimony, Assange said he was unaware that cameras installed by Undercover Global were also capturing audio and suggested the surveillance likely targeted members of his legal team, according to a spokesperson for his lawyer.
Owner and director of UC Global S.L. David Morales declined to say whether his company spied on Assange. ""All the information is confidential and it belongs to the government of Ecuador,"" Morales told El Pais in July. ""We simply did a job.""
Judge De la Mata initially detained Morales in September, and then released him on bail.
Speaking outside the court in Westminster, former Ecuadorean consul in London Fidel Navraez accused Undercover Global of betraying Ecuador and Assange.
""That company was contracted by Ecuador in order to protect the embassy, protect Julian Assange, protect the embassy staff ... but it is a corrupt company - we know that now,"" he said.
Assange's legal team wants to have the firm and its founder charged with crimes including violation of privacy and attorney-client privilege, money laundering, and bribery.
Assange spent nearly seven years holed up in the embassy in order to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape that were dropped in November.
He was forcibly removed from the embassy in April and jailed for 50 weeks for skipping bail in Britain before the U.S. began its extradition request. A full extradition hearing for Assange, 48, is scheduled in February.
Assange faces 18 counts in the United States including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. If convicted, he could spend decades in prison."

WARSAW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Poland's lower house of parliament approved the latest reform of the judiciary on Friday, despite the European Commission calling it to hold off adopting a law which it says would imperil the rule of law.
The European Commission believes the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has been politicizing the judiciary since it came to power in 2015 and it has launched unprecedented legal steps against Poland to preserve the courts' independence.
Commission spokesman Christian Wigand told reporters that Commision Vice President Vera Jourova had written to Polish authorities on Thursday expressing concern about the draft law.
In the letter, Jourova ""strongly encouraged"" Poland to consult the Council of Europe's Venice Commission of legal experts and ""invited"" state organs not to take forward the draft legislation before the necessary consultations.
Still, PiS, which has a majority in the lower house of parliament, approved the bill and the government spokesman said that the commission probably issued its opinion ""without having reliable information"" about the changes.
The ruling party slightly watered down its proposals, by removing from the bill rules that would require judges to reveal the names of social media accounts they use under pseudonyms.
The legislation will still allow the punishment of judges who question their peers' legal status or the validity of other courts, for example, by cutting their salaries or dismissing them.
""I would not like to live in a country where these regulations are implemented, because it will mean that we – as citizens - will not have the right to an independent court,"" ombudsman Adam Bodnar told TVN24 private broadcaster.
The latest judiciary overhaul came after some judges questioned the independence of peers nominated by a panel set up under rules drawn up by the PiS-dominated parliament after nationalists won the 2015 elections.
PiS argues that the reforms are necessary to make Poland's courts more efficient.
The legislation will now be discussed in the upper house of parliament, the Senate, which has been controlled by anti-PiS parties. The opposition can delay the legislation, but has no power to derail it, experts say."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of reports on Friday indicating that the outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries appears to be waning, as evidence mounts that vitamin E acetate, a cutting agent used in marijuana vape cartridges, is playing a role in the illnesses.
So far, 54 people have died and more than 2,500 have been hospitalized in the outbreak, which started in the summer and spread to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories.
In a telephone briefing with reporters, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, said evidence now suggests that vitamin E acetate was increasingly being added to cartridges containing THC - the high-producing compound in marijuana - beginning in June, when the outbreak began to ramp up.
Schuchat said THC vaping ""largely explains"" the big increase in acute cases that spiked over the summer, but the findings do not imply that nicotine vaping is entirely safe.
In one report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, public health officials found that emergency room visits for the vaping lung injuries rose sharply beginning in June and peaked in September. Since then, emergency room visits have tapered off but still remain higher than when the outbreak started in June.
In a second report in the New England Journal, researchers report that additional testing of lung samples from people who had vaping injuries strengthens earlier studies pointing to vitamin E acetate as a likely culprit in the outbreak.
The study, which looked at lung samples from patients in 16 states, found vitamin E acetate in 94 percent of lung samples taken from patients who vaped THC.
In a separate study in the CDC's Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report, of the 2,409 people whose cases were reported to the CDC as of Dec. 10, thirty-one patients who had been discharged got sick again and had to be readmitted to the hospital, and seven people died shortly after discharge.
Patients who got sick after discharge tended to have a history of heart disease, respiratory conditions and diabetes. Those who died after discharge were more likely to be 50 or older.
With these cases, the CDC is now recommending that patients be clinically stable at the time of discharge, and that they follow up with a doctor within two days of discharge. CDC's earlier guidance called for a two-week follow-up."
171,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>",Greece to extradite Russian cybercrime suspect to France,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece will extradite a Russian man suspected of having laundered billions of dollars in the digital currency bitcoin to France, the justice minister decided on Friday, court officials said.
Alexander Vinnik, the alleged mastermind of a $4 billion bitcoin laundering ring, is one of seven Russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on U.S. cybercrime charges.
Greece's top court had cleared the way for Vinnik's extradition to the United States in December 2017.
But a final decision on where he would be extradited to rested with the Greek justice minister, who steps in to resolve competing requests. The United States, France and Russia have all made requests.
""Justice Minister Costas Tsiaras decided that 40-year old Vinnik should be finally extradited to France,"" one official said.
The ministerial decision mentions that a second destination should be the United States and lastly Russia, meaning that when he is done with his judicial proceedings in France he could be extradited to the United States.
According to his lawyer, the ruling led Vinnik to start a new hunger strike, calling the decision unfair and a ""death sentence"".
U.S. authorities accuse Vinnik of running BTC-e — a digital currency exchange used to trade bitcoin — to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking since 2011.
He has denied the charges, saying he was a technical consultant to BTC-e and not its operator.
Since his arrest in a village in northern Greece, Moscow has also requested he be returned home, as it has done before with other nationals wanted by the United States.
Vinnik has agreed to be returned to Russia, where he is wanted on lesser fraud charges amounting to 10,000 euros. He had appealed to the Greek Supreme Court against a ruling that he be extradited to the United States but the Supreme Court rejected his appeal.
Bitcoin was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and anonymous, making it difficult to subject them to conventional financial regulations.
Vinnik continues to be treated in an Athens hospital for health problems following a hunger strike in November 2018 that lasted 88 days."

LONDON (Reuters) - British prosecutors said on Friday they had decided to charge the wife of a U.S. diplomat over a fatal car crash in England and to seek her extradition, a decision that ""disappointed"" Washington.
Harry Dunn, 19, died after his motorcycle was in a collision with a car driven by Anne Sacoolas near RAF Croughton, an air force base in the English county of Northamptonshire that is used by the U.S. military.
Sacoolas, 42, was given diplomatic immunity and left Britain shortly after the accident, setting off a dispute between London and Washington over whether she should return to face investigation.
She said she would not return voluntarily to face a potential jail sentence.
Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said on Friday it would charge Sacoolas with causing death by dangerous driving and had started legal proceedings.
But it said it was up to the Home Office (interior ministry) to decide whether to seek Sacoolas' extradition formally through diplomatic channels.
British foreign minister Dominic Raab welcomed the charging decision, adding in a statement: ""I hope that Anne Sacoolas will now realize the right thing to do is to come back to the UK and cooperate with the criminal justice process.""
The U.S. State department expressed disappointment.
""We are disappointed by today's announcement and fear that it will not bring a resolution closer,"" a State Department spokesperson said.
""The United States has been clear that, at the time the accident occurred, and for the duration of her stay in the UK, the driver in this case had status that conferred diplomatic immunities.""
Sacoolas' lawyer Amy Jeffress said her would not be going back to Britain to face trial.
""Anne will not return voluntarily to the United Kingdom to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident,"" Jeffress said in a statement.
'BEAUTIFUL' BUT 'SAD'
Dunn's case gained international prominence when his parents met U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in October, an occasion he described as ""beautiful"" but ""sad"". 
Trump hoped to persuade them meet Sacoolas, who was in the building at the same time, but they declined.
Sacoolas initially cooperated with local police after the crash, but later said she had diplomatic immunity.
The White House and the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The maximum jail sentence in Britain for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years.
Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, broke down in tears after finding out charges had been brought, saying it meant she had kept a promise to her son to get him justice.
""We had no idea it was going to be this hard and it would take this long, but we really do feel it is a huge step towards that promise to Harry,"" she told reporters.
Edward Grange, a partner at the criminal law firm Corker Binning, said Sacoolas could voluntarily attend a hearing in Britain and that if she failed to appear, it could lead to an extradition request.

""The prospect of an extradition request succeeding remains to be seen, particularly in light of comment from the Trump Administration that it is very reluctant to allow its citizens to be tried abroad,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp cruise ships collided on Friday in the port of Mexico's Caribbean resort of Cozumel, the luxury cruise operator said, crushing the stern of a 952-foot-long (290-meter) vessel and leaving passengers stunned at the loud impact.
One person was lightly injured while evacuating a dining room on the massive ship named Carnival Glory, according to Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator. A passenger said the incident occurred during rough sea conditions.
""Carnival Glory was maneuvering to dock when it made contact with Carnival Legend which was already alongside,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are assessing the damage but there are no issues that impact the seaworthiness of either ship."" 
Carnival added that the ship itineraries were not affected.
Civil protection authorities in Cozumel said the incident took place at around 8:30 a.m. (1430 GMT) and that officials were investigating.
Passenger Jordan Moseley said he was eating breakfast on the docked Carnival Legend, a 963-foot-long (294-meter) ship that can hold more than 2,000 passengers, when he felt the crash.
""All of a sudden we felt the ship rock to one side and then back into place,"" Moseley told Reuters. ""A few minutes later, the cruise director announced that the Carnival Glory had crashed into our ship while docking due to the high winds and rough ocean conditions in Cozumel.""
A video taken from an upper deck of Carnival Glory, which can carry nearly 3,000 passengers, shows pieces of the ship tumble onto the deck of the oncoming vessel, with some splashing into the churning water.
""Oh my God, look at that ship!"" an onlooker can he heard saying in the video posted on social media.
Other images of the battered vessel show a railing along the Carnival Glory stern bent downwards at a roughly 45-degree angle, revealing a twisted and mangled ship interior. 
Christopher Macijeski, who was on a third cruise ship nearby, said there was a loud boom from the impact. 

""Could see it coming before it happened,"" he said.

Police arrested activist Tito Magoti with three other unnamed people on Friday on ""various allegations"", Dar es Salaam's police chief Lazaro Mambosasa told reporters.
He did not give details.
Police earlier said they had no information on Magoti after his organization alleged he had been abducted, in what initially appeared to be the latest in a series of abductions in the East African nation.
    ""We have received distressing news that our officer at the public education unit, Tito Magoti, has been abducted by people in civilian clothes at the Mwenge area in Dar es Salaam,"" Dar es Salaam-based Legal and Human Rights Center said on Twitter.
The group that employs Magoti has been a vocal advocate for rights in Tanzania, including demanding an investigation into an assassination attempt on leading opposition figure Tundu Lissu, who was shot 16 times by unknown gunmen in September 2017.   
Since President John Magufuli was elected in late 2015, Tanzania has tightened control of the media and civil society, shutting newspapers and websites, and arrested opposition leaders and restricted political rallies.
The 60-year-old has been nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"", partly for his forceful leadership style.
    He denies restricting media freedom and cracking down on democracy and human rights.
Last year, Africa's youngest billionaire and Tanzanian businessman Mohammed Dewji was abducted outside a luxury hotel in Dar es Salaam. He was returned home safely a week later, but has not disclosed details of the incident aside from thanking the police at the time.
Other prominent Tanzanians have gone missing in recent years. Tanzania said in July it did not know whether investigative journalist Azory Gwanda, who went missing in November 2017 while investigating a series of murders of police and ruling party officials, was dead or alive."

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping and claimed progress on issues from trade to North Korea and Hong Kong, but China said Xi accused the United States of interfering in its internal affairs.
The two leaders spoke a week after their envoys sealed a ""Phase 1"" agreement aimed at ending an 18-month trade war that has rattled markets and raised tensions.
Trump announced the phone call in a tweet. A White House official said they spoke on Friday morning. China Central Television said Xi spoke to Trump at the request of the U.S. president.
""Had a very good talk with President Xi of China concerning our giant Trade Deal. China has already started large scale purchase of agricultural product & more. Formal signing being arranged. Also talked about North Korea, where we are working with China, & Hong Kong (progress!)"" Trump tweeted. 
China's Xinhua news agency said Xi told Trump that China is deeply concerned about ""the negative words and deeds"" of the United States on issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet.
""These actions have interfered in China's internal affairs, harmed China's interests and undermined mutual trust and cooperation between the two sides,"" Xinhua said.
The United States has called for the closure of mass detention camps in China's western region of Xinjiang and expressed concern about the treatment of demonstrators in Hong Kong.
Xinhua said Xi hoped Trump would implement ""the important consensus"" reached during their meetings and phone calls and ""pay close attention to and attach importance to China's concerns, and prevent the interference of bilateral relations and the important agenda.""
China was angered when Trump last month signed legislation that authorizes sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong, in what was seen as support for pro-democracy activists.
Of paramount concern to the United States is a threat by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for what Pyongyang has called a ""Christmas gift.""
U.S. officials have interpreted this to mean either a nuclear weapons test or a ballistic missile test. Trump and Kim have held three summits but failed to reach an agreement on lifting sanctions on North Korea in exchange for denuclearization by Pyongyang.
China and Russia on Monday proposed that the U.N. Security Council lift a ban on North Korea exports such as seafood and textiles, in a move the Russian U.N. envoy said was aimed at encouraging talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
The State Department, in response, said the U.N. Security Council should not be considering “premature sanctions relief” for North Korea as it is “threatening to conduct an escalated provocation, refusing to meet to discuss denuclearization.""
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng met U.S. special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun on Friday, China's foreign ministry said, Biegun's second high-level meeting in Beijing in two days amid growing tension on the Korean peninsula.
North Korea has conducted a series of weapons tests in recent weeks and some experts say the reclusive state may be preparing for an intercontinental ballistic missile test soon.
Such a test would mark a break from the detente reached with the United States last year, dash any hopes of resuming talks on ending North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and put the two countries back on a path of confrontation. 

Xinhua said that Xi stressed to Trump that all parties need to seek a political settlement on the North Korean issue and that ""all parties should meet each other halfway and maintain the momentum of easing dialogue, which serves the common interests of all parties.""

The right-wing government's positive rating has declined in Ibope's four previous polls this year, falling from 35% in April. Its negative rating has risen from 27% in April.
Public confidence in Bolsonaro's governing style is also dropping, the poll said. A majority of those polled, or 53%, do not approve of the way he is governing Brazil, up from 40% in April and 50% in September. Those who approve of his way of governing has fallen to 40% from 51% in April and 44% in September.
The number of Brazilians who said they trusted Bolsonaro has also dropped off, within the margin of error, to 41% from 51% in April and 42% in September. Those who have no trust in him rose to 56% from 45% in April and 55% in September.
The poll commissioned by industry lobby CNI was carried out Dec. 5-8, before the latest developments in a corruption investigation of Bolsonaro's son Senator Flavio Bolsonaro.

YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroon's parliament granted special status on Friday to two English-speaking regions to try to calm a separatist insurgency that has killed 2,000 people, but the separatists said only independence would satisfy them.
The law, passed in a special session of parliament, says the Anglophone Northwest and Southwest regions ""benefit from a special status founded on their linguistic particularity and historic heritage"".
It mentioned schools and the judiciary system as part of the special status -- a delayed response to protests in 2016 by teachers and lawyers.
Conflict between Cameroon's army and English-speaking militias seeking to form a breakaway state called Ambazonia began after the government cracked down violently on peaceful protesters complaining of being marginalized by the French-speaking majority.
The insurgency has forced half a million people to flee and presented President Paul Biya with his biggest threat in nearly 40 years of rule.
""This is a law unique in the world,"" said senator Samuel Obam Assam, from the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement, the majority group in the Senate. ""It is an answer to our fellow countrymen's concerns.""
But Jean-Michel Nintcheu, a congressman from the main opposition party, said he did not believe the law would solve the crisis.
""The Anglophones, even the moderate ones, want a federal state. This law is not the result of a dialogue.. we were against it,"" he said.
The reforms were recommended at the end of national talks organized by Biya in October to chart a way out of the conflict.
But separatists boycotted that dialogue, saying they would negotiate only if the government released all political prisoners and withdrew the military from the Northwest and Southwest.
""We want independence and nothing else,"" said Ivo Tapang, a spokesman for 13 armed groups called the Contender Forces of Ambazonia.
He said the special status made no difference as no law passed in the Cameroonian parliament should be imposed in Ambazonia.
The roots of Cameroonian English speakers' grievances go back a century to the League of Nations’ decision to split the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors at the end of World War One."

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson won approval for his Brexit deal in parliament on Friday, the first step toward fulfilling his election pledge to deliver Britain's departure from the European Union by Jan. 31 after his landslide victory.
Lawmakers voted by 358 to 234 to pass the second reading of the legislation, underlining Johnson's large majority in parliament that should ensure a smooth ratification of the divorce deal to implement Britain's biggest policy shift in more than 40 years.
More than three years since Britain voted to exit the EU in a 2016 referendum, the deep uncertainty over Brexit has now been replaced by a firm deadline of the end of January. Only after that will the prime minister face talks to secure a trade deal with the bloc and another target date of the end of next year.
Getting ""the Brexit vote wrapped up for Christmas"" was the main aim for Johnson showing that, unlike his predecessor Theresa May who was thwarted in parliament, he now has free rein to drive Brexit forward despite continued criticism from opposition lawmakers.
""This is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of 'leave' and 'remain' ... now is the time to act together as one reinvigorated nation, one United Kingdom,"" Johnson told parliament before the vote.
""Now is the moment to come together and write a new and exciting chapter in our national story, to forge a new partnership with our European friends, to stand tall in the world, to begin the healing for which the whole people of this country yearn.""
The final stages of ratification will take place after Christmas, with the lower house of parliament having until Jan. 9 to approve the legislation, or Withdrawal Agreement Bill, giving it just over three weeks to then pass through the upper house and receive Royal Assent. 
The European Commission said it was ready to take formal steps to adopt the deal on its side too.
TRADE TALKS TO COME
After leaving, Britain will need to secure new trading arrangements with the EU - which the prime minister said would see the country agree a trade deal with no alignment to the bloc's rules. 
In a change to the bill, Johnson made it illegal to extend those talks beyond the end of next year.
European Council President Charles Michel said a level playing field on rules and standards ""remains a must"" for any future relationship. 
While Johnson has the support of his 365 Conservative lawmakers in the 650-seat lower house, some opposition members criticized him for removing the opportunity for parliament to have oversight over his negotiating priorities in the next phase of talks, and for getting rid of workers' protections. 
Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described it as ""terrible"". 
""This deal does not bring certainty for communities or for business or for the workforce, in fact it does the opposite and hardwires the risk of a no-deal Brexit next year,"" he said.
Just a week after he won the largest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher in 1987, Johnson has set out an ambitious government program, with securing Brexit at the top of his agenda to repay the trust of voters.
Hoping to satisfy the demands of voters in northern and central England who broke their tradition of backing the Labour Party to support him, he has also pledged more funding to the state health service, education and policing.

""Today we will deliver on the promise we made to the people and get the Brexit vote wrapped up for Christmas,"" he said in comments before the vote. ""Next year will be a great year for our country.""

Winston-Salem city manager Lee Garrity said in an email that authorities would disclose further information about the shooting at a news conference at 2 p.m. EST.
A city employee told WXII 12 News that the shooting occurred at about 6:45 a.m. and stemmed from an argument between two other workers.

Protesters waved the national flag and chanted ""Tebboune is not our president"" and ""we will continue our protests"" in a heavily policed central district of the capital Algiers.
Some also chanted: ""Police are traitors"" while others called for people in the western city of Oran, where there have been reports of arrests, to keep on marching. 
The protesters have marched every Friday since February, demanding that the entire ruling elite quit power, an end to corruption, and that the army withdraw from politics. 
In April, the unrest forced veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down, as the military and its allies purged his cronies in an anti-corruption drive while pushing for new elections. 
Protesters rejected any election as illegitimate so long as the old ruling elite, including the military, held power. Tebboune was elected with 58% of the vote last week, but with even official figures showing only 40% turnout. 
He and the four other candidates, all former senior officials, praised the protesters for seeking a patriotic renewal of Algerian politics, but without acceding to their demands for a more thorough purge of the hierarchy. 
At his inauguration on Thursday, Tebboune offered dialogue with the protesters and pledged to start work soon on a new constitution that would limit presidents to two terms in office. 
However, he also presented a medal to army chief Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah, whose resignation protesters have demanded for months. 

The mass protest movement has no formal organization or leadership, but some prominent supporters have urged dialogue with Tebboune. Demonstrators on Friday rejected talks with a man they regard as a puppet of the old ruling elite.

MBABANE (Reuters) - Police in eSwatini arrested the head of the southern African country's largest opposition party and several other politicians and activists in raids on their houses on Friday, their parties said.
The raids took place as people's anger against King Mswati III, an absolute monarch, has swelled in the past year.
Police Commissioner William Dlamini told reporters the police had ""invited some individuals to assist us in our enquiries pertaining to state security information,"" but denied that any of them been arrested or detained.
A spate of anti-monarchy demonstrations have taken place across eSwatini - formerly known as Swaziland - this year. Some have turned violent with police using tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon to disperse stone-throwing protesters.
Demonstrators say the king drains public coffers to fund a lavish lifestyle while most of his 1.5 million subjects eke out a living toiling in maize or sugarcane fields.
A decade ago Forbes estimated Mswati's net worth at $200 million, a figure he has said was made up.
Percy Simelane, a spokesman for the government and the king, referred Reuters to the police when asked for comment.
Some of the protest marches were organized by the Political Parties Assembly, whose leaders have been targeted in the raids.
Mlungisi Makhanya, president of the People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), told Reuters the party's secretary general Wandile Dludlu had been arrested and political materials and electronic devices had been seized.
He added that a lawmaker and former trade union leader and the presidents of the Swaziland National Association of Teachers and the Ngwane National Liberatory Congress had also been targeted.
The Communist Party of Swaziland said its national chairperson, Dumisani Fakudze, had also been detained.
Trade unionist Jan Sithole told Reuters after being released that the police had kept his mobile phone, laptop and flash drives."

""I am satisfied that ... war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,"" Fatou Bensouda said in a statement. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ICC has no jurisdiction to investigate in the Palestinian Territories.
""The court has no jurisdiction in this case. The ICC only has jurisdiction over petitions submitted by sovereign states. But there has never been a Palestinian state,"" Netanyahu said in a statement.
Bensouda said the preliminary examination into alleged war crimes, opened in 2015, had rendered enough information to meet all criteria for opening an investigation. 
The ICC prosecutor said she had filed a request with judges for a jurisdictional ruling, because of the contested legal and factual status of the Palestine territories.
The ICC has the authority to hear cases of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity committed on the territory of the 123 countries that have signed up to it.
Israel has not joined the court but the Palestinian Authority - a limited self-rule body in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - has done so.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of Hong Kong anti-government activists gathered outside a detention center on Friday, demanding the release of arrested activists and denouncing a police crackdown on a fund-raising platform supporting protesters in need.
Congregating outside a detention center in the western Kowloon district of Lai Chi Kok, the crowds held up signs with the words ""In Solidarity We Stand"", waved flags and demanded the release of all protesters.
""I feel quite sad for the young people, they are fighting for liberty...for us all,"" said Ben, a 68-year-old retiree. 
After a relative lull in sometimes violent protests that have gripped the former British colony over the past six months, some protesters were alarmed by police moves to freeze HK$70 million ($9 million) in bank deposits held by fund-raiser Spark Alliance.
The protesters are angry at perceived Chinese meddling in the city's freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies the charge.
Police said one man fired a pistol at them in the New Territories town of Tai Po, but did not say if it was protest related. They seized a ""pistol-like object"" and detained one man.
The use of firearms in Hong Kong is very rare, even by police.
Spark Alliance was launched in 2016 to support protesters on a number of fronts including legal fees. Police said they arrested three men and one woman for suspected ""money laundering"", according to a statement. 
Spark Alliance on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page said it ""condemned such smear tactics"" by the police. 
Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo, who was also at the protest, said the police case was tenuous at best, and she questioned why the fund had run for several years without incident.
""It's too convenient for the authorities to call it money laundering,"" she said. 
Global banking group HSBC (L:HSBA) (HK:0005) on Friday strongly denied any link between the police clampdown on Spark Alliance and the earlier closure of an HSBC bank account tied to the group. 
A small group of protesters had earlier called for a boycott of the bank at its headquarters in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district.
""Our decision (to close the account) is completely unrelated to the Hong Kong police's arrest of the four individuals on 19 December 2019,"" HSBC said in a statement. 
""We closed the account in November 2019 following direct instruction from the customer."" 
Hong Kong has been convulsed by anti-government, pro-democracy protests in the city's worst political crisis in decades. 
They have also posed a grave populist challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping who just completed an official visit to the neighboring gambling hub of Macau, which celebrated the 20th anniversary of its handover from Portuguese to Chinese rule. 

Amid a rising tide of anti-China sentiment, as public anger flares toward China's perceived squeeze on the city's freedoms, some mainland Chinese banks and businesses have been vandalized.

184,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>",Wider Image: Portraits from the frontlines of global protests,"(Reuters) - Protests swept the globe in 2019, with millions of people taking to the streets from Catalonia to Colombia, Haiti to Hong Kong.
Each movement had its own trigger. Some were fed up with corruption and entrenched elites. Others wanted democracy or independence.
Some called for reforms and others opposed them. Worries over climate change and environmental destruction also galvanized activists worldwide. The frustrations were sometimes similar, from inequality to powerlessness.
Often the protests turned violent, with security forces killing several hundred people in Iran, Iraq and elsewhere. Volleys of tear gas became a familiar sight in traditionally peaceful and stable Hong Kong.
Yet amid the gunfire and clouds of tear gas, there was a global solidarity as demonstrators drew on each other's determination and strength.
Reuters photographers in more than a dozen countries documented the depth of feeling that linked disparate movements.

""Right now we are in a stage of awakening and we have to take advantage of that,"" said Andres Felipe Vargas, a professor joining an anti-government strike in Bogota, Colombia.
""What is happening in our country, and these injustices that generate inequities, are the same injustices that are destroying the planet,"" he said.
In Algeria, Amiri Yacine, who joined rolling demonstrations since February in opposition to the elite that has controlled the country since independence in 1962, likewise feels his demands are universal.
""I am protesting against injustice and dictatorship,"" said Yacine, 26, holding a poster depicting the world's protests as a blossoming flower, packed amongst hundreds of mostly young demonstrators in Algiers. ""We want to build a new Algeria.""
""My message to protesters is just be peaceful - be wise and keep calm. Fight the system with good ideas, because they don't have ideas."" 
SEASON OF DISCONTENT
Summer has turned to winter in Hong Kong, where demonstrations against a controversial extradition bill turned into a push for greater democracy.
The Beijing-backed government has refused to yield, while the protesters have gathered in vast numbers, turning shopping districts into a sea of black-clad people. 
""This is a universal demand for democracy and fairness,"" said Jasper, a 27-year-old bank worker, who joined a downtown protest at lunchtime. He cut a suave figure, in a suit, red-and-blue striped tie and pocket square, standing on Pedder Street in the city's central district. 
Like many protesters he declined to give his surname and wore a surgical mask to conceal his identity.
""Every country in the world faces the same situation. This will not be an easy road, but we all know we are doing the right thing.""
The movement has invited comparisons with protesters pushing for independence for the Spanish region of Catalonia, where the sentencing of separatist leaders to long prison terms led to renewed and sometimes violent protests.
""We're here, mainly young people, outraged by the sentences and the inability of politicians to talk,"" said Barcelona student Axel Buxade, 18, holding a Catalan flag at a demonstrators' camp on a city street.
""There have been acts of mutual support, if they reach their goal we'll be very happy,"" he said, referring to Hong Kong.
Economics, and in particular inequality has also proved potent fuel for protests in Lebanon, Chile, Ecuador and Iraq.
""People in the world are tired of injustice,"" said Chilean Alex Munoz Fuentes, a 47-year-old accountant, standing before a burning barricade on a Santiago street.
""I don't want anything given for free,"" he said, the national flag in one hand and a pair of goggles to protect him from the effects of tear gas in the other.
""But I know that in Chile the institutions, the law and the constitution are made to abuse the working classes. I want a new deal.

""Hong Kong is similar, the authorities are not thinking about people's well-being. I have a fraternal hug for them, and all my solidarity from Chile. Please don't give up.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Philip, the 98-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth, was taken to hospital on Friday as a precaution for treatment of an existing condition, Buckingham Palace said.
Philip, whose official title is the Duke of Edinburgh, traveled from the royal family's Sandringham home in Norfolk, eastern England, to the King Edward VII Hospital in London for observation and treatment, the palace said in a statement. 
""The admission is a precautionary measure, on the advice of His Royal Highness’ Doctor,"" it said.
A royal source said it was not an emergency admission and that the prince had been able to walk into the hospital.
Philip, who has been at his wife's side throughout her record-breaking 67 years on the throne, retired from public life in August 2017 although he has occasionally appeared at official engagements since.
He has not been seen in public since the wedding of Elizabeth's first cousin once removed, Gabriella Windsor, in May at Windsor Castle, local media reported.
The outspoken, irascible and intensely private prince, who has a reputation for brusque comments and occasional gaffes, has needed hospital treatment several times in recent years.
In 2011, he spent Christmas in hospital after an operation to clear a blocked artery in his heart and he missed the end of celebrations to mark his wife's 60th year on the throne in 2012 after being hospitalized with a bladder infection.
The Greek-born former naval officer then underwent ""an exploratory operation following abdominal investigations"" in 2013.
He was admitted to hospital in 2017 for treatment for an infection, also arising from a pre-existing condition, and last year, he had hip-replacement surgery which required a 10-day stay.
In January this year, he escaped unhurt when his Land Rover flipped over after a collision with another car near the Sandringham estate. He then had to give up his driving license after police gave him a warning for driving without wearing a seat belt two days later.
Elizabeth and Philip, who married at London's Westminster Abbey in 1947, celebrated their 72nd wedding anniversary in November.

Previously unable to collect their credentials due to fears of being arrested by Spain, the two politicians, who live in self-imposed exile in Belgium, should get full accreditation in January at the earliest, a chamber's spokeswoman said.
The decision stems from Thursday's ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) saying that imprisoned separatist leader Oriol Junqueras was entitled to immunity as an MEP after being elected in May. 
Puigdemont and Comin also won European Parliament seats in May but fears of returning to Spain, where they face arrest warrants, prevented them from taking their oaths and collecting their MEP credentials.
""We are at the place where we should have been six months ago,"" Puigdemont told reporters inside the European Parliament, where he and Comin collected their badges.
The former Catalan regional government president said he hoped to take part in the next parliamentary session and criticized the Spanish judiciary, which he said was not independent and could not guarantee the defense of their rights.
Puigdemont faces an arrest warrant from Spain for his role in the 2017 failed independence drive in Catalonia. The warrant is being analyzed by Belgium. 
He said he wished to visit Catalonia as soon as possible, but that it was too early to say when that would be. 
The EU's highest court said earlier on Friday that a lower EU court must reexamine the requests of Puigdemont and Comin to take up their seats as European lawmakers in light of Junqueras' ruling after the lower court had dismissed their request in June.
Junqueras was sentenced to 13 years in prison in October for his role in an Catalan independence referendum that was deemed illegal by Spanish courts. He was elected an MEP while in prison awaiting the verdict.

A long line of vehicles was seen on Friday leaving the opposition-held city of Maarat al Numan which has borne the brunt of the attacks, which included air strikes, they said.
""The exodus is in the thousands. It's a humanitarian catastrophe, we are seeing people walking in the streets and people waiting near the homes for cars to take them out,"" said Osama Ibrahim, a rescue worker from Maarat al Numan.
Air strikes killed six people overnight in Maarat al Numan and 11 were killed in villages in the area, rescue teams said.
Hundreds of people have been killed this year in attacks on residential areas in the region, according to U.N. agencies, though a Syrian and Russian military campaign launched at the end of April had subsided in August under a fragile ceasefire.
Syrian state media said the Syrian army had pushed into several villages southeast of Idlib.
Rebel fighters, who say the Russian and Syrian forces are implementing a scorched earth policy as they advance, said villages seized included Um Jalal in southern Idlib province and Rabea and Harbiya in eastern Idlib.
Russia and the Syrian army, which is loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, deny allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and say they are fighting al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who reached an accord last September with Russia to contain the fighting and whose country is seen by many civilians in opposition areas as a protector, has warned of a renewed refugee influx.
Erdogan said on Thursday 50,000 people were fleeing Syria's northwestern region of Idlib. He did not say whether any of the people fleeing had entered Turkey."

Saeed, who was indicted on similar charges in another case on Dec 11, was presented in an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore, prosecutor Abdur Rauf Watto told Reuters.
Defence lawyer Imran Gill said the second case was related to Saeed's charity operations. ""The militant charities the accused ran collected illegal funds,"" Watto said.
Saeed is the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or the Army of the Pure, a militant group blamed by the United States and India for the four-day Mumbai siege in which 160 people were killed. Foreigners, including Americans, were among the dead.
Pakistan's counterterrorism police arrested Saeed in July, days before a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The indictments came ahead of a meeting of world financial watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) early next year that will decide whether to blacklist Pakistan for its failure to curb terror financing.
The United States has offered a reward of $10 million for information leading to the conviction of Saeed, who has been arrested and released several times over the past decade.
Washington has long pressured Pakistan to try Saeed, who is designated a terrorist by the United States and the United Nations.
The Islamist has denied any involvement in the Mumbai attacks and says his network, which spans 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services, has no ties to militant groups."

LONDON (Reuters) - A policy which allows British security service agents to commit serious criminal activities including violence is lawful, a tribunal ruled by a slim majority on Friday.
Four human rights groups had argued that it was against British law and the European Convention on Human Rights for the MI5 domestic spy agency to permit agents, those who are informants or provide intelligence but do not work directly for the government, to commit crimes including murder and torture.
In its submissions, the government said it would be impossible for MI5 to operate, gather intelligence and prevent terrorist attacks without using agents and it was necessary for agents to be allowed to be involved in criminality.
However, it said that did not give them immunity from prosecution.
The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), which deals with complaints about the intelligence services, backed that view, making reference to recent deadly attacks by militants. However, two of its five members disagreed with the decision.
""This case raises one of the most profound issues which can face a democratic society governed by the rule of law,"" the IPT said in its ruling.
""The events of recent years, for example in Manchester and London in 2017, serve vividly to underline the need for such intelligence-gathering and other activities in order to protect the public from serious terrorist threats.""
Privacy International, Reprieve, the Committee on the Administration of Justice and the Pat Finucane Centre said the once-secret MI5 policy had been in operation at least since the early 1990s and had only come to light when former Prime Minister Theresa May acknowledged its existence in 2018.
They referred to a 2012 report into the murder of Irish lawyer Pat Finucane at his home in Belfast in 1989 which concluded it was carried out by pro-British militants in collusion with the security forces.
The report found that Finucane would not have been murdered without the involvement of state actors.
""Today, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal decided that MI5 can secretly give informants permission to commit grave crimes in the UK, including violence,"" said Ilia Siatitsa, Legal Officer for Privacy International.
Maya Foa, Reprieve’s Director, said the ""knife-edge judgment"" showed how dubious the policy was. The civil rights groups said they would seek permission to appeal against the ruling.
While the IPT upheld the lawfulness of the policy, it said it did not give carte blanche to MI5.
""It is important to appreciate that this does not mean that it has any power to confer immunity from liability under either the criminal law or the civil law ... on either its own officers or on agents handled by them,"" the IPT said."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Friday honored two members of the British ""Cambridge Five"" spy ring who passed information to the Soviet Union with a memorial plaque and a tribute from the head of Russia's foreign intelligence service.
The plaque, unveiled on the day Russia celebrates the work of its security services, was dedicated to Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean and attached to the wall of the building where they lived from 1952-1955 in the city of Samara, then known as Kuibyshev.
The ceremony comes as relations between London and Moscow remain strained over everything from the 2018 poisoning in England of a former Russian spy and his daughter to Syria and Ukraine. 
The shadowy world of the Cambridge spy ring, which was active from the 1930s until at least the early 1950s and also included Kim Philby, Anthony Blunt, and a fifth man, has long fascinated British audiences.
Burgess and Maclean, who were recruited by the Soviets at Cambridge University in the 1930s, worked under Philby at the British Embassy in Washington, before both defected to the Soviet Union in 1951.
Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service, praised Burgess and Maclean for their work in a letter, posted on social media by a lawmaker in Russia's parliament, Alexander Khinshtein, who attended the unveiling. 
""The 'Cambridge Five', having supplied Soviet intelligence with the most important information for more than 20 years, made a significant contribution to the victory over fascism, the protection of our strategic interests and ensuring the safety of our country,"" the letter said. 
Burgess and Maclean remained in the Soviet Union until their deaths in Moscow in 1963 and 1983 respectively.
The plaque reads: ""In this building, from 1952-1955, lived Soviet intelligence officers, members of the 'Cambridge Five', Guy Francis Burgess and Donald Maclean."" 
During Soviet times, Samara was named after Bolshevik revolutionary leader Valerian Kuybyshev. Off limits to foreigners, it was the secretive heart of the country's space program.

Philby, seen as the ""Cambridge Five"" ringleader, was honored with his own plaque in 2010 at the headquarters of the foreign intelligence service in Moscow.

Turkey has backed Libya's internationally recognized government led by Fayez al-Serraj and the two sides signed a security agreement last month which could deepen military cooperation between them.
Turkey has already sent military supplies to Libya in violation of a United Nations arms embargo, according a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month. It said Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) asked Turkey for help after Haftar received support from Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
Turkey had not responded directly to the assertions in the report, but Erdogan said Ankara could not ignore the support that Haftar was receiving from the Kremlin-linked Wagner group.
""Through the group named Wagner, they are literally working as Haftar's mercenaries in Libya. You know who is paying them,"" Erdogan was quoted by broadcaster NTV as saying on a flight back from Malaysia.
""That is the case, and it would not be right for us to remain silent against all of this. We have done our best until now, and will continue to do so,"" he added.
Erdogan's comments come a day after Serraj's government said it ratified last month's security and military accord with Ankara, opening the way for greater Turkish support, as it fights a months-long offensive by Haftar's forces.
Earlier on Friday, Russia said it was very concerned by the prospect of Turkey sending troops to Libya, adding that the deal on military cooperation between Ankara and Tripoli raised many questions for Moscow, according to the Interfax news agency.
Erdogan said on Wednesday Turkey would improve cooperation with Libya by offering military support to the GNA and backing joint steps in the eastern Mediterranean. Ankara has previously said it could send military support to the GNA if it requested it, but says no such request has been made yet.
The Kremlin said on Tuesday Erdogan and Russia's Vladimir Putin would discuss Ankara's potential military deployment to Libya during talks in Turkey next month."

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A security contractor was killed on Friday in an attempted armed robbery on a Harmony Gold plant west of Johannesburg, the latest fatal incident at a mining company in South Africa.
High gold prices are making processing plants a target for criminals in South Africa, leading to a spate of armed robberies at mining operations, and the head of the country's main mining industry body called for more police resources to tackle the problem.
No gold was stolen from Harmony's Kalgold plant, about 330 km (205 miles) from Johannesburg, in the attack in the early hours of Friday, the company said.
""A reaction unit supervisor employed by a contracted security company was fatally wounded in an armed attack on the plant... in the early hours of this morning,"" Harmony Gold said in a statement.
The South African Police Service (SAPS) was investigating the incident, the miner said.
The Minerals Council, an industry body representing mining companies, said there have now been nine ""significant"" attacks on the gold industry in the past year, in which employees and security personnel have been held hostage and assaulted, and in two cases killed.
Minerals Council CEO Roger Baxter (NYSE:BAX) said a lack of police resources to prevent these violent assaults was a major threat to the industry.
""Essentially, the industry is under siege. These crimes are hurting South Africa’s investment and economic prospects and urgent action is required,"" Baxter said in a statement calling for intervention from the Minister of Police and the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy.
In a similar incident in October, armed men broke into a metallurgical plant owned by DRDGOLD, killing the gold miner's chief security officer and stealing calcine concentrate containing an estimated 17 kg of gold.
The price of gold - in U.S. dollars - has surged more than 15% this year, the strongest gain in the precious metal's value since 2010.
In a country on the brink of recession, with unemployment at an 11-year high, illegal gold mining and trading, and armed robberies of gold plants are on the rise.
Escalating violence targeting some of its workers drove Anglo-Australian miner  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) to curtail operations at its South African unit Richards Bay Minerals, which mines ilmenite, rutile, and zircon, earlier this month.
Harmony said that due to the ongoing police investigation it would give no further information on the incident on Friday for the time being."
193,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>","Special Report: How murder, kidnappings and miscalculation set off Hong Kong’s revolt","By David Lague, James Pomfret and Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says the plan that ignited the revolt in her city was born of a straightforward quest for justice.
While on a trip to Taiwan, a Hong Kong man strangled his Hong Kong girlfriend, then returned home and confessed. The city lacked an extradition pact with Taiwan, and Lam argued the only way to send him back for trial was new laws that also would enable sending criminal suspects to mainland China. She dismissed fears about the proposal – which would mean Hong Kong residents could face trial in China’s Communist Party-controlled courts – and pushed ahead.
As protests raged this summer, even in private Lam kept to her story that she, not Beijing, was the prime mover, driven by “compassion” for the young victim’s devastated parents. “This is not something instructed, coerced by the central government,” she told a room of Hong Kong businesspeople at a talk in August.
A Reuters examination has found a far more complicated story. Officials in Beijing first began pushing for an extradition law two decades ago. This pressure to extend the arm of Chinese law into Hong Kong’s independent British-style legal system intensified in 2017, a year before the slaying and two years before Lam’s administration announced its extradition bill. The impetus came from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the Communist Party’s powerful internal anti-corruption body, which has been spearheading Chinese President Xi Jinping’s mass anti-graft campaign.
Xi’s crackdown spilled over dramatically into the streets of Hong Kong in the early hours of January 27, 2017. Among the targets of CCDI investigators at the time, two mainland Chinese officials with knowledge of the probe told Reuters, was a Chinese billionaire living in the city named Xiao Jianhua. A businessman with close ties to China’s political elite, Xiao was abducted that morning from his serviced apartment at the luxury Four Seasons Hotel. Unidentified captors whisked him out the entrance in a wheelchair with his head covered, a witness told Reuters.
The sensational kidnapping, widely reported at the time, was assumed by most people in this city of 7.5 million to have been the work of Chinese agents; Beijing has never commented publicly on the matter. Frustrated at the lack of legal means to get their hands on Xiao, the two Chinese officials told Reuters, the CCDI that same year began pressing mainland officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement. The CCDI wanted a less politically damaging method than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong, the officials said.
The two sides failed to strike a deal, but the killing in Taiwan would provide a new opening.
Pro-Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong championed the calls for justice of the victim’s grieving parents, arranged an emotional news conference for them and pushed Lam’s administration to find a way to extradite the killer. One of China’s top officials for Hong Kong affairs pressed a senior Lam adviser in a private meeting in Beijing on the need to pass the proposal. Early in the crisis, when Lam privately proposed withdrawing the bill to quell the protests, senior Chinese officials rejected the move, only to relent months later as public fury mounted.
The extradition law would have been a boost to Chinese interests, a senior mainland official told Reuters, by eliminating the need to resort to kidnappings or other controversial extrajudicial acts in Hong Kong. The move would have helped us “avoid such problems,” he said.
This account of how the extradition bill was launched, promoted and ultimately unraveled is based on more than 50 interviews with mainland officials, current and former Hong Kong government officials, members of Lam’s cabinet, associates and friends of the Hong Kong leader from her days as a student activist, and current and former lawmakers and police officers. Reuters also drew on the public record of debates and correspondence regarding the bill in the city’s legislature, the Legislative Council.
One finding that emerges is how out of touch the mainland leadership and the people it has hand-picked to run Hong Kong were with public sentiment. When China reclaimed Hong Kong from British rule in 1997, it guaranteed under a “one-country, two-systems” formula that the city would keep its treasured freedoms for 50 years. In effect, the promise postponed a decision on how an authoritarian one-party state would absorb a liberty-loving capitalist city. After two decades of determined grassroots political work by Beijing to win hearts and minds, some of the bill’s leading supporters admit they were stunned by the hostility of so many Hong Kong citizens to Chinese rule.
“I was shocked to discover that in fact a very large proportion of us, people in Hong Kong, do not really feel at all comfortable with one-country, two-systems,” said Ronny Tong, a member of Lam’s top advisory body, the Executive Council, in an interview with Reuters. “How do you deal with this lack of confidence if not outright hatred about Beijing? How do you deal with it?”
In a written statement to Reuters, Lam’s office said the bill “was initiated, introduced and taken forward” by her administration. The central government in Beijing “understood” why the bill had to be introduced, the statement said, and “respected the view of the Chief Executive” and “supported her all the way.”
Chinese government authorities did not respond to questions for this article.
THE 'MYSTERY' OF CARRIE LAM
The city’s revolt has dealt a major setback to Xi Jinping, coming as he contends with a damaging trade war with the United States. And in a blow to China's dreams of reunifying Taiwan with the mainland, the crisis appears to have boosted the popularity of Taiwan's independence leaning President, Tsai Ing-wen, who faces the polls in January.
For Carrie Lam, 62 years old, the miscalculation has been crushing.
Her failure to grasp the public’s suspicion of the mainland’s legal system has shattered a reputation for competence built up over a 39-year career in public service. In the past she was sometimes referred to by admirers as Hong Kong’s Iron Lady, for a resolute manner reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher’s. Now, some say a combination of her willfulness and her decades at the top levels of Hong Kong’s insular public service blinded her to the political danger of the extradition bill.
“The one mystery, the one puzzle is, how is it possible that Carrie Lam didn’t see the implications of such a proposal?” said Margaret Ng, a barrister who was a longtime lawmaker in the pro-democracy camp.
Born into a working class family, Lam grew up in a small apartment in the suburb of Wan Chai on Hong Kong island. Like many of the city’s government elite, she is a Catholic, educated in the city’s Catholic schools, and she remains devout. At St. Francis’ Canossian School and then St. Francis’ Canossian College, she was a star student.
In a 2013 radio interview, she revealed a glimpse of a fierce competitive streak. Lam told her interviewer of an enduring memory of her school days: The single occasion she failed to finish at the top of her class in a big exam. She said she cried.
When she began studying at the University of Hong Kong, Lam intended to be a social worker. Lee Wing-tat, a former lawmaker from the pro-democracy camp, was a fellow student. He recalls Lam was an activist in those days, taking part in protests. A citation when she was awarded an honorary degree in 2013 described how Lam had campaigned for better treatment for poor Chinese fishing families from the British colonial government.
She was intensely interested in welfare for the underprivileged, Lee said. And she was already a talented organizer. “You give her a job and she will deliver results,” Lee said.
In 1979, as post-Maoist China was opening up, students from Hong Kong were invited to send a delegation to Beijing to visit elite universities, Lee said. The Democracy Wall movement was in full swing there, with big posters calling for political and social reform appearing on a long brick wall. The Hong Kong students wanted to meet prominent liberals and soak up the atmosphere, Lee said. Lam was involved in negotiating the visit with the tough Communist bureaucrats at Xinhua News Agency, then Beijing’s unofficial mission in the British colony.
“They made it very difficult for her,” Lee recalls. “They didn’t want us to meet them.” The visit went ahead, and a highlight was a banquet Lam attended where a leading liberal journalist was a guest.
“At that time, Carrie was not so conservative,” Lee said. “She was a democrat. Just like me. After government, things changed.”
Lam abandoned plans to become a social worker and joined the colonial Hong Kong government in 1980 as an administrative officer, the elite cadre of officials who are given broad exposure to different government roles as preparation for promotion to more senior posts.
In the Hong Kong civil service, well paid administrative officers have traditionally enjoyed considerable power and prestige in a political system without the scrutiny public servants receive in a full democracy. Lam rose fast and embraced challenging roles. Her critics say she also became arrogant and dismissive of advice from peers and subordinates.
“She has never been known to be a team player,” says retired civil servant Anson Chan, who served as Hong Kong’s deputy leader before and after the handover. “That has a lot to do with her character and was also instrumental in her spectacular downfall.”
Lam’s office declined to respond to “speculations or third parties’ comments” about her.
Others paint a different picture. Veteran social activist Ho Hei-wah, director of the Society for Community Organization, said he began working closely with Lam in the 1980s, when she led successful efforts to reunite Hong Kong families with mainland relatives. “She is a caring person,” he said. “From the beginning until today.”
Ho said he helped persuade Lam to become deputy to the city’s former leader, Leung Chun-ying, in 2012. She had planned to retire to spend more time with her mathematician husband and two sons, Ho said, but agreed to take the post because she felt she could continue to serve the city.
Hong Kong had been under mainland rule for 15 years. Xi Jinping was about to assume power. And Beijing was about to begin flexing its muscle more forcefully.
In the final months of British rule, Hong Kong had passed laws barring the extradition of suspects to the mainland as an added protection to the freedoms promised under the one-country, two-systems formula. Beijing began making demands to reverse these provisions almost immediately after the handover, according to the Hong Kong government officials involved in talks about the issue. They say their mainland counterparts regarded it as an affront that the newly recovered territory would allow extradition to some foreign countries – even to America and Britain - but not to the motherland.
The discussions went nowhere, and on Leung and Lam’s watch, China began taking matters into its own hands.
A BILLIONAIRE VANISHES
One of the first major extralegal arrests to gain public attention was the disappearance in 2015 of five booksellers of local publisher Mighty Current.
The publisher specialized in muckraking books on the private lives and business dealings of China's top leadership, including Xi himself. It later emerged that two of the men had been kidnapped – one in Hong Kong, one from Thailand – and taken to the mainland. A third later detailed how he was grabbed by Chinese agents while visiting southern China and held captive for eight months. He fled to Taiwan this April as Lam’s government sought to ram through the extradition bill.
Hong Kong leaders knew about these extralegal detentions but were unwilling to publicly call out mainland authorities over them. Lam herself was closely informed about one case.
In 2013, a Hong Kong resident, Pan Weixi, and his wife were grabbed off the street in the city and smuggled to the mainland by speedboat. The family wrote to Lam describing the abduction in detail and appealing for her help in obtaining the businessman’s release, according to people with knowledge of the case. Hong Kong police confirmed to Reuters that they sent officers to Guangdong who helped secure the wife’s freedom and escorted her home. The family later learned that Pan was sentenced to 16 years in jail in Guangdong Province. A Hong Kong police investigation into the case remains open.
After the bookseller abductions sparked an outcry, Hong Kong officials revealed in May 2016 they were in discussions with Beijing over formal extradition procedures. The talks failed, according to lawyers involved, because Beijing was unwilling to accept human-rights and legal safeguards.
Then, in early 2017, came the brazen abduction of Xiao, the billionaire who was a target of the powerful anti-graft agency CCDI. A Hong Kong government official said Xiao had crossed the border with the mainland. The city was scandalized.
These controversies didn’t impede Lam’s rise. As Leung’s deputy, she was closely involved in the government’s handling of the Umbrella Movement, a 79-day campaign of civil disobedience in 2014 in which protesters demanding full democracy occupied major thoroughfares. The movement got its name from demonstrators’ use of umbrellas to ward off police. Lam made conciliatory gestures, meeting protesters for talks, but that failed to produce a breakthrough. Police eventually cleared the protesters, and some key leaders were later prosecuted.
In March 2017, Lam was handpicked as China’s candidate to succeed Leung and easily won election by a committee of about 1,200 mostly pro-Beijing figures. She won plaudits in China for pushing through some unpopular policies. Within weeks of taking office in July 2017, her administration announced a controversial plan to let mainland officials stationed inside a Hong Kong train terminus enforce Chinese laws on travelers passing through.
Critics said this and other moves further eroded the city’s autonomy. Lam’s office rejected the criticism, saying the terminus arrangement made for more convenient travel.
Xi later praised Lam for her courage in taking on “difficult challenges,” after the two met in Beijing in December 2018, state media reported.
Two months later came the killing in Taiwan. The two young Hong Kongers – Poon Hiu-wing and her boyfriend, Chan Tong-kai – quarreled while on a trip to Taipei. Furious, Chan bashed Poon’s head against a wall and strangled her, packed her body in a suitcase and later left it at a park in the Taiwanese capital, according to a Hong Kong court judgment. Chan was arrested in March after returning to Hong Kong and confessed. He was convicted and jailed for crimes committed after his return, including using Poon’s ATM card to withdraw money. But because the slaying took place in Taipei, he would need to be sent to Taiwan to be tried for the killing.
Chan’s lawyer didn’t respond to questions for this article.
Lam later told a news conference that since the killing, her government had been spending “quite a bit of time” devising extradition proposals. In the meantime, Beijing’s political allies in the city started agitating for change.
The initial moves were low-key and attracted little attention. On May 4 last year, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, Priscilla Leung, called on the city’s Legislative Council to consider discussing judicial cooperation with Taiwan and “other places,” according to the minutes of a panel session in the council. Leung, a law professor, chairs a legislative panel on judicial affairs. She had no comment.
Within days, Leung’s proposal got a push from two lawmakers with strong links to Beijing. Starry Lee and Holden Chow went further in a letter to Leung, calling on the government to begin moves to conclude an extradition agreement with Taiwan “as soon as possible,” council records show. Lee heads the city’s biggest political party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, which hews closely to Beijing’s official line. Chow is a vice chairman and the party’s highest-profile young leader.
‘THIS WILL DESTROY HONG KONG’
The next month, one of Lam’s top lieutenants dropped a clue that changing the law on extradition was under consideration.
In answer to a written question from Starry Lee about the efforts to return the killer to Taipei, Secretary for Security John Lee said Hong Kong was studying how to handle the case. And he reminded her that under the law, the city was barred from sending suspects to any region of the People’s Republic of China. Hong Kong shares Beijing’s view that Taiwan is part of the PRC. Taiwan vehemently disagrees.
Lee, 62, was a 33-year veteran of the Hong Kong police. He joined the government’s Security Bureau, which oversees the police and other law enforcement units, as deputy head in 2012 and was promoted to lead the bureau when Lam took office. Cops who served with him describe Lee as a shrewd and incorruptible crime fighter who was trusted with sensitive investigations before and after the handover. As security chief, Lee is responsible for liaison with the mainland’s powerful law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
Poon’s family was begging for justice. Their pleas reached Lam. The chief executive said she was moved and promised to help. Lam later gave a tearful television interview to local broadcaster TVB in which she said Poon’s heartbroken father had been persistent, writing five letters to the government seeking justice for his daughter.
“That’s why I told John Lee that you can’t just write a letter back to them and only say, ‘Sorry, Mr. Poon, there isn’t a legal basis for this, sorry’,” Lam said. “I said you must find a way, and not let any possibility go.”
Poon’s father declined to comment.
Starry Lee and Holden Chow continued rallying support for the Poon family and for changing the extradition law. In mid-February, they appeared at a press conference with the mother.
“Even though it’s been a year since my daughter was murdered, my husband and I can’t accept this reality,” Poon’s mother, Kui Yin-fun, said, sobbing. “I always think of this cold-blooded and cruel scene. How the murderer dragged a suitcase, and moved the corpse, and then left it in the open, so that wild dogs could eat it.”
The only way to help her daughter now, Kui told the media crowd, was justice: extradite the killer. Then Holden Chow and Starry Lee took questions. Asked whether amending the law was the sole way to deal with the case, Starry Lee said: “In principle, without this amendment of the legislation, this cannot be done.”
Asked about his championing of the bill, Chow told Reuters the plan was introduced “to deal with the Taiwan murder case and to provide the victim's family justice.” Unfortunately, he added, the Lam administration was unable to explain the human-rights protections contained in the bill and persuade the public to embrace it. Starry Lee didn’t respond to a request for comment.
There was broad support for the Poon family in Hong Kong. But that didn’t translate into support for extradition to the mainland.
That same week, a Legislative Council agenda included an item on judicial cooperation with Taiwan and “other places.” The next day, the government showed its hand, revealing in an official briefing note that to resolve the Poon case, it was proposing amendments that would remove the ban on extraditions to other parts of China. The ban, it said, had created “loopholes,” allowing the city to become a haven for criminals.
Pro-democracy lawmaker Dennis Kwok was outraged. The next day, he confronted security chief John Lee in a meeting room at the Legislative Council.
“I told him don’t do this,” Kwok told Reuters. “I told him it is a crazy idea. I lost my cool with him. I said this will destroy Hong Kong. Don’t do it!”
Lee ploughed ahead, telling reporters in March that the restrictions on extradition to other parts of China were a “chain that has been put on my feet.”
Chinese leaders publicly began throwing their weight behind the effort. In March, Chen Zhimin, a former vice minister of public security, linked the bill to Xi’s crackdown. He told Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK a pact was needed because there were more than 300 fugitives on China’s wanted list hiding in the city. Chen also revealed that before he left his post in 2017, mainland officials had been discussing an extradition pact with their Hong Kong counterparts – including John Lee.
In a statement to Reuters, Lee said it was “totally unfounded and erroneous” to suggest that the mainland and pro-Beijing parties were the driving force behind the bill. The alleged abductions of billionaire Xiao and others were irrelevant, he said: The trigger was the Poon killing, which exposed gaps in the law. The central government, he added, respected Lam’s views and “supported her all the way.”
By May, higher officials – including a member of the Party’s top decision-making body, the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee – were publicly backing Lam’s bill. Chinese leaders were also mobilizing support behind the scenes.
One was Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, the body that coordinates Beijing’s policy for the city. In May, Ronny Tong, the influential Lam adviser and top barrister, led a delegation of his political allies to the Chinese capital. In a 90-minute meeting, Zhang explained the importance of the extradition bill to China and Hong Kong, according to two delegation members. Zhang took a “hardline” position, they said, telling the visitors it was urgent that Hong Kong pass the measures.
Chinese authorities didn’t respond to questions about the roles of Zhang, Chen and other top leaders.
Outside of Lam’s circle, alarm was spreading through Hong Kong. Even the normally pro-Beijing business community was unnerved by the bill. People began coming out to protest by the hundreds, then by the thousands, then tens of thousands and more. On June 9, the government was shaken when an estimated one million people took to the streets in a peaceful protest. Demonstrations later turned violent.
On June 11, lawmakers were preparing for a second reading of the bill, scheduled for the next day. Pro-Beijing lawmakers had the numbers if the bill came to a vote. That day, protesters began surrounding the Legislative Council building in an effort to block the session.
With the demonstration snowballing, the Hong Kong liaison office, China’s official representative body in the city, had unwelcome news to report that night. According to two Chinese officials with knowledge of the matter, the office informed the CCDI in Beijing that the encircling protesters made it impossible to hold the debate the following morning. The CCDI suggested that lawmakers be assembled at another venue to vote, the officials said.
The protest had effectively shut down the legislature, however, preventing the second reading. Soon after, Lam crossed into the mainland and paid a call at Bauhinia Villa, a resort in the suburbs of Shenzhen where the Chinese leadership had set up a secret command center to manage the crisis.
There, Lam met with one of China’s highest leaders – Vice Premier Han Zheng, the Politburo Standing Committee member who had earlier signaled support for the bill. As Reuters reported last month, she proposed suspending the legislation. After consulting with other leaders in Beijing, Han agreed.
On June 15, Lam announced she was freezing the bill. The protesters, unmollified, insisted on a total scrapping. On July 1, a crowd smashed its way into the Legislative Council and ransacked the building.
The pressure began telling on the city leader once lauded by Xi for her steeliness. In August, at times choking up, Lam told a private meeting of businesspeople that she would quit if allowed to do so.
“Hong Kong has been turned upside down, and my life has been turned upside down,” she said, according to an audio tape obtained by Reuters. The bill was “very much prompted by our compassion” for the Poon family, “and this has proven to be very unwise.” It turned out, she said, that there was “this huge degree of fear and anxiety amongst people of Hong Kong vis-a-vis the mainland of China, which we were not sensitive enough to feel and grasp.”
In late August, Reuters revealed that officials in Beijing had rejected a proposal from Lam to scrap the bill altogether earlier in the summer and defuse the crisis.
On September 3, Lam declared the bill would be formally withdrawn. But the protests continued as the movement morphed into a broad pursuit of democratic rights.

Chan Tong-kai was released after serving 19 months in prison in Hong Kong. On October 18, five days before walking free, he revealed there was no need for an extradition deal in his case. In a letter to Lam, Chan said he was volunteering to return to Taipei to face justice. He remains free in Hong Kong while Lam and Taiwan wrangle over the details.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chants of ""Remove Modi"" filled the air after Friday prayers at the historic Jama Masjid as protesters gathered to march toward New Delhi's center, one of many demonstrations across India over a citizenship law critics say discriminates against Muslims.
While the latest rally in the capital started peacefully, police herded away some 100 protesters picketing parliament. Many other protests during the past week have turned violent, with at least seven people killed.
Police in the southern coastal city of Mangaluru imposed a three-day curfew on Friday after the latest two fatalities.
In Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, authorities said they shut down the internet in large parts of the state to prevent inflammatory material being circulated. News channel NDTV broadcast images from the state of a torched police van, and officers chasing protesters throwing stones and wielding sticks. 
The backlash against the law pushed through parliament by India's Hindu nationalist government on Dec. 11 marks the strongest show of dissent since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was first elected in 2014.
The new law makes it easier for people from non-Muslim minorities in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who settled in India prior to 2015 to obtain Indian citizenship.
Critics say the exclusion of Muslims is discriminatory, and the award of citizenship based on religion undermines India's secular constitution.
From college students and academics to artists and opposition party workers, thousands of people have come out to protest against a law that many believe is part of an unspoken agenda to divide India along communal lines. Muslims make up 14% of India's population.
On the street below the sprawling steps of Jama Masjid, Muslims were joined by people of other faiths, including a large number of Dalits, the community that ranks at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy.
Police and paramilitary were deployed outside the mosque and the atmosphere was tense as more than a thousand people joined the rally, Reuters witnesses said. Several of them carried copies of India's flag and the constitution, which states India is a secular republic.
""We will fight till this law is rolled back. We will not back down,"" said Shamim Qureishi, a 42-year-old man chanting slogans outside the mosque.
Aside from targeting Modi, protesters also vented their fury at Amit Shah, the interior minister who had tabled the bill.
Members of the women's wing of the main opposition Congress party demonstrated outside Shah's home in Delhi on Friday.
In Uttar Pradesh, a tinder-box for communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims, authorities arrested over 100 people, largely from the Muslim-majority areas where protests were held Thursday.
Prominent human rights lawyer Mohammed Shoaib was also detained, and another human rights activist and ex-policeman, S.R. Darapuri, was placed under house arrest. 
The government has blocked mobile internet and text messaging services in 20 districts there until Saturday.
Awanish Kumar Awasthi, the state official issuing the order, said the move was aimed at preventing the spread of inflammatory material that could worsen the law and order situation. 
In the southern coastal city on Mangaluru, authorities imposed a curfew until midnight on Dec. 22, after two people died in clashes between police and stone-throwing protesters. 
A police spokesman said 20 officers were injured in the Mangaluru clashes. ""Police forces are deployed across the city and the law and order situation right now is quite peaceful and everything is under control,"" said police spokesman Guru Kamat.

Previously, some of the most violent protests have been in Assam, a northeast state bordering Bangladesh. Assamese people are angered by the encouragement being given to immigrants, regardless of their religion.

His remarks were the latest vows of defiance against the court in The Hague that has yet to decide whether to investigate him over thousands of deaths in his crackdown, during which activists say crimes against humanity were committed.
""You do not scare me that you will jail me in the International Criminal Court. I will never allow myself to answer these whites,"" Duterte said in a speech to military cadets and reservists.
""I will never, never, never answer any question coming from you. It's bullshit to me. I am only responsible to the Filipino. Filipinos will judge.""
""He added: ""And if you hang me for all what I did, go ahead. It will be my pleasure.""
Duterte has also blasted the United Nations after its human rights body approved a resolution in July to investigate alleged abuses in the Philippines.
The maverick former mayor has repeatedly taunted the ICC and threatened to slap or arrest its prosecutor, who in February 2018 announced a preliminary examination was being conducted into the drugs killings.
Duterte, 74, responded by unilaterally cancelling his country's membership of the court a month later, without legislative approval, saying it had deprived him of a presumption of innocence. Amnesty International called his move ""misguided"" and ""cowardly"".
The ICC's prosecutor says jurisdiction applies to crimes committed while a country is a member.
In a scheduled Dec. 5 report on its activities worldwide, the ICC said it had ""significantly advanced"" its examination and aimed to finalize it in 2020, then decide whether to seek a formal investigation.
Human rights groups say Duterte's anti-drugs crackdown had led to systematic executions and police cover-ups. Police reject that and say the nearly 7,000 people they have killed were armed drug suspects who resisted arrest."

""Japan would like to do its utmost to ease tensions and stabilize the situation in the Middle East,"" Abe told Rouhani at the start of a meeting between the two leaders in Tokyo.
""As for Iran, I strongly hope the country will fully implement the nuclear agreement and play a constructive role for peace and stability in the region."" 
Iran, the United States and other countries in 2015 signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which Tehran curbed its uranium enrichment capacity and won sanctions relief in return. 
President Donald Trump later withdrew the United States from the deal, which sought to head off any pathway to an Iranian nuclear bomb, and increased sanctions on Iran to pressure its economy by ending its international sales of crude oil.
Iran, for its part, has gradually scaled back its commitments to the deal this year.
At their meeting, Rouhani asked Abe to work with other countries to help keep the nuclear deal in place.
""The nuclear agreement, needless to say, is a very important agreement for Iran. That is all the more reason for me to criticize strongly the United States' unilateral and irrational departure,"" Rouhani said through a translator. 
""I hope Japan and other countries in the world will work hard to help keep the nuclear agreement in place."" 
Japan, a U.S. ally maintaining friendly ties with Iran, was a leading buyer of Iranian oil for decades before the U.S.-led sanctions.
Iran says it has enriched uranium only for civilian purposes, but the United States and the U.N. nuclear watchdog believe it once had a nuclear weapons program that it ended.

More than 450 people, mostly unarmed demonstrators but also some members of the security forces, have been killed since a wave of popular unrest began on Oct. 1. Protesters, most of them young, are demanding an overhaul of a political system they see as profoundly corrupt and keeping most Iraqis in poverty.
""The fastest and most peaceful way out of the current crisis, and avoiding the unknown or chaos or civil strife, is to go back to the people by holding an early election after legislating a fair electoral law,"" Sistani said.
Parliament failed on Wednesday to pass a new electoral law, a key demand of protesters, which would make elections fairer after votes in recent years have been marred by allegations of fraud.
""We hope that the formation of a new government is not delayed for long,"" Sistani said in a speech read out by a representative at a Friday sermon in the Shi'ite holy city of Kerbala.
Deadlock in parliament also held up the selection of an interim prime minister, causing lawmakers to miss on Thursday the constitutional deadline to name a replacement for Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who resigned last month but has remained in office in a caretaker capacity.

Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, was convicted earlier this week under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Sengar, who was later expelled from the party, had pleaded not guilty.
The court in Delhi also fined him 2.5 million rupees ($35,000), Sengar's lawyer Tanveer Ahmad Mir said.
""He got his punishment. I am very happy ... Today we got justice,"" the India Today television network quoted the woman's sister as saying.
The case gained nationwide attention last year when the accuser, who was a teenager in 2017 when she says she was raped, tried to kill herself, accusing the police of inaction.
In July, a truck crashed into a car she was traveling in. Two of her relatives were killed and she was injured. Since then the family has been provided with security.
Her case was the latest in a country where sexual violence against women is unabated despite enacting some of the world's toughest laws.
Public outrage has been mounting over the lack of speedy justice for victims.
Sengar is expected to appeal against the decision at the Delhi High Court, his lawyer said, and the case can run for years in Indian courts."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Former Malaysian premier Najib Razak took an oath at a mosque on Friday denying allegations he ordered the 2006 murder of a Mongolian model, seeking to clear his name in the Muslim-majority country.
Ousted in a general election last year after a corruption scandal for which he is on trial, the former prime minister says the accusations by a death-row police officer that he was behind the slaying of 28-year-old Altantuya Shaariibuu is a political ploy to jail him.
Policeman Azilah Hadri and another officer, who were serving on Najib's security detail at the time of the murder, were sentenced to death in 2015 for the killing of Shaariibuu.
Najib was Malaysia's deputy prime minister and held the defense portfolio when Shaariibuu was shot dead and her body was blown up by military-grade explosives in a forest near the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
""In Allah’s noble house, and on this thankful Friday, I declare and swear ... I have never instructed any individual to murder a woman of Mongolian nationality named Altantuya Shaariibuu,"" Najib read from a sheet of paper at a mosque in central Kuala Lumpur, his wife and daughter by his side.
""And I have never met and did not know the dead at all. If I lie, then the curse of Allah is upon me and if I am true, then those who slander me and do not repent will be cursed by Allah,"" drawing cheers from nearly 1,000 supporters who witnessed his oath.
Najib has never faced any charges in connection with the woman's murder. He is however, facing criminal charges in connection with a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power.
It has never been established who was behind the two policemen convicted of killing Shaariibuu.
But Najib's former bodyguard Azilah, in a court filing this month seeking to set aside his conviction, said Najib had ordered him to ""arrest and destroy"" Shaariibuu, who the former premier had allegedly described as a foreign spy, news portal Malaysiakini reported on Monday.
Malaysia's Federal Court will hear Azilah's application on April 20.
Civil society groups have alleged Shaariibuu's murder was linked to her role as an interpreter for Abdul Razak Baginda, a former associate of Najib, in Malaysia's purchase of two submarines from French shipbuilding giant DCNS in 2002.
Abdul Razak, who said he had an affair with Shaariibuu, was in 2008 acquitted of abetting the murder.
Azilah's co-accused, Sirul Azhar Uma, fled to Australia shortly before his sentence was handed down."

A gunman opened fire on the FSB's main building in Moscow on Thursday evening in a shooting incident that left at least one FSB employee dead and five other people wounded. It was not immediately clear what the shooter's motive was.
There has been no official confirmation of the identity of the gunman, who the FSB said it had killed. But some Russian media, citing unnamed sources, have named the suspect as Yevgeny Manyurov, a 39-year-old former private security guard.
Manyurov lives with his mother in a five-storey Soviet-era apartment block in the town of Podolsk in the Moscow Region. His neighbors, who described Manyurov as a quiet gun enthusiast, told Reuters on Friday that the FSB had raided the family home in the early hours of Friday morning.
There was no immediate comment from the FSB."

The reform package would ease some of the most widely criticized restrictions on political freedoms in a country which has no real opposition parties in parliament and where government critics have often faced criminal charges.
Tokayev, who took over the former Soviet republic in March when Nursultan Nazarbayev resigned after almost 30 years in power, announced his plans at a meeting of the National Council of Public Trust, an advisory body he established this year.
""We are making a serious step towards reforming the existing political system,"" Tokayev said.
A new draft law on public rallies excludes provisions requiring official approval, which have effectively served as a blanket ban on protests.
Hundreds of people were detained at protests during and after the June presidential election, which Tokayev won with Nazarbayev's backing. Dozens are also routinely held by police at smaller rallies.
In another move easing political restrictions, the minimum number of people required to start a party will be halved to 20,000, Tokayev said.
Tokayev also said offences such as slander and libel would be removed from the criminal code and the article on hate speech would become more specific and less harsh. Both have often been used against opposition activists and government critics.
Kazakhstan's parliament is dominated by the ruling Nur Otan party which Nazarbayev continues to lead while also remaining the head of the powerful security council and carrying the title of Yelbasy, or national leader. A parliamentary election is scheduled for 2021."
204,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 04:01AM ET</span>",Heathrow's new runway delayed until at least 2028,"LONDON (Reuters) - An expansion plan for Britain's Heathrow Airport will be delayed by more than a year and a third runway now will probably be completed between early 2028 and late 2029, the airport said.
The delay came after Britain's aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, said the airport could not increase its spending on early construction costs to ensure that the runway was built by the end of 2026, as it wanted.
The CAA said it was in the best interests of consumers for Heathrow to spend more than 1.6 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) on early construction, rejecting the airport's 2.4 billion-pound plan.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has opposed Heathrow's expansion, but parliament has approved the 14 billion-pound plans, which include building the first full-length new runway in the London area for 70 years.
The expansion plan is also opposed by climate change protesters and some local residents. It is being challenged in the courts.
The CAA said that limiting costs to 1.6 billion pounds was in the best interests of passengers, who could end up footing the bill through higher airport charges if Heathrow does not win planning permission.
""While we recognize the potential benefit to consumers of the runway opening being as early as possible, we are also mindful of the risks associated with sunk costs,"" the CAA said in a report published on Thursday.
It said that an independent surveyor had called Heathrow's plan to open a new runway by 2026 a schedule which is ""in all likelihood too aggressive"".
Heathrow called the CAA's report ""an important milestone"" but said it would result in the delay.
""The CAA has delayed the project timetable by at least 12 months. We now expect to complete the third runway between early 2028 and late 2029,"" a spokesman for the airport said.
Heathrow Airport is owned by Ferrovial, Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corp, among others."
205,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 03:34AM ET</span>","From housewives to hijab-clad students, women take center stage in Indian protests","By Aftab Ahmed and Zeba Siddiqui
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As a crowd of protesters swelled around them under the watchful eyes of dozens of policemen in riot gear, a cluster of young female students in burqas stood outside their university in New Delhi shouting anti-government slogans. 
""What is happening in the country is wrong,"" Shabana, a 21-year-old student at Jamia Millia Islamia University, said through the veil covering her face. Jamia Millia is a major public university in the capital where a large number of Muslims study. ""They can't suppress our voices.""
As protests in India against a new citizenship law that critics say targets Muslims grow by the day, they have drawn many women and girls - some housewives, some students with hijabs covering their hair, and others in full-length burqa robes - in a rare sign of public anger against the government.
The women can be seen painting graffiti on university walls, organizing rallies and gathering funds for posters and food for protesters. 
Shabana, who would only provide her first name, said she had been moved to act after some of her friends had been injured when police stormed the Jamia campus to break up a protest involving hundreds of students last weekend. 
At least 200 students were injured as police fired tear gas and used batons to disperse the crowd. The police have denied using excess force. 
""I had to lie to my parents, but I'm still here, because this is important. We need to speak out,"" Shabana said at the rally Tuesday. ""I was horrified when I saw their injuries.""
The protests, some of the most widespread in India in recent years, erupted on Dec. 11 after Parliament passed the controversial law, which protesters say is an attack on India's secular foundations. 
The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi insists the new law is essential as it eases the path for minorities from neighboring countries to gain Indian citizenship. But critics say it is biased as it excludes Muslim immigrants. 
'WE ARE NOT SCARED'
Many protesters Reuters spoke to over the past week are Muslim women and girls from conservative backgrounds. Some said they had to sneak out of their homes to join the protests. 
""My mother stops us from stepping out, but if we do not know show strength now, then how will we encourage others to step out?"" said Nazia, a 13-year-old schoolgirl protesting outside the university.
In the past, women have played a prominent role in many Indian protests, including those that broke out following the brutal rape of a young woman on a Delhi bus in 2012. 
But the current displays of public anger include people not usually seen out protesting. Social norms have often restricted participation by Muslim women in the public arena in India.
Most girls and women interviewed declined to give their full names as they did not want their families to know they were involved in the protests.
Shumaila, a 24-year-old PhD scholar at the Jamia university, said that many women from around the surrounding neighborhood had also come out in solidarity with the students. 
One of them was Nadia Khan, a 35-year-old housewife who said: ""The government has forced us to come out on the streets.""
""We are not scared of the government or the prime minister. We are ready to take a bullet in our chest,"" she said. ""We know how to fight for our rights.""
""BIG TONGUE""
Among the most striking images of the protests that began in India's northeast before mushrooming across the country, was one of three young women pointing fingers in the air and shouting slogans from the top of a wall outside the Jamia campus last week, with a throng of protesters around them. 
One of those women, Chanda Yadav, comes from the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, where she says she was raised in a conservative environment in which women's voices were suppressed. 
""There were restrictions on everything from the kind of clothes I wore to what time I would come home from school,"" said Yadav. ""I would always argue with my family over it. My uncles would often say, 'Shut up, you've got a big tongue!'""
Yadav, 20, is now a Hindi language masters student at the Jamia university, and her voice, as she stood alongside two hijab-clad school-mates, was among the loudest at the protest.
Yadav said she was a Hindu, but felt strongly that all Indians needed to come forward to oppose the law.

""This is not the issue of just one community,"" said Yadav. ""What they are doing to Muslims today could happen to anyone tomorrow.""

PATHEIN, Myanmar (Reuters) - Dozens of Rohingya Muslims including children wept in a Myanmar court on Friday as they were brought in to face charges of illegally traveling without proper documents.
They were arrested on Nov. 28 on a beach in the Irrawaddy river delta region while fleeing from western Myanmar's Rakhine State.
The group of 93, including 23 children, were brought to a court in the delta town of Pathein to listen to the testimony of an immigration officer who accused them of not having necessary documents for traveling.
If convicted they face up to two years in prison.
""They said they ran away because conditions are difficult over there,"" said defense lawyer Thazin Myint Myat Win, referring to Rakhine State where most members of Myanmar's Rohingya community live.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar to Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a military-led crackdown that U.N investigators have said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"" and included mass killings and rapes.
Some 600,000 Rohingya are living in conditions the United Nations has described as deplorable in Rakhine State, subject to restrictions on movement that touch almost every aspect of their lives including healthcare and education.
Many try to flee, often on boats bound for Malaysia, Indonesia or elsewhere in Southeast Asia, particularly after the end of the rainy season in November, when the sea is calmer.
Girls wearing colorful head scarfs and boys were lined up in the court to listen to the testimony before adults were brought in.
They cried as the judge spoke to them through a translator.
""You cannot make a noise in the court during the hearing. If so, you will lose your rights,"" judge Khin Myat Myat Tun told them.
One of the defendants told the court they had not illegally entered the country. The judge told him their lawyer would make that point and he did not need to do so now.
The next hearing is on Jan. 3.
In recent weeks, several groups of Rohingya have been arrested while attempting to flee by boat.
In November, a Pathein court sentenced 14 people to two years in jail for illegal travel."
207,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 02:49AM ET</span>",Australian PM apologizes for vacation as firefighters killed in huge blazes,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison issued a rare public apology on Friday and cut short a Hawaiian vacation in response to mounting public anger after two volunteer firefighters were killed battling bushfires sweeping the country's east coast.
Some areas of Sydney are set for ""catastrophic"" conditions on Saturday, and the deadly fires are now engulfing other parts of the country. One person was killed in a car crash on Friday near South Australia's capital city of Adelaide where an emergency warning is in place, though the precise circumstances surrounding the death is not yet clear.
Australia has been fighting wildfires across three states for weeks, with blazes destroying more than 700 homes and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland. 
The death of the two firefighters overnight when their fire truck was struck by a falling tree as it traveled through the front line of a fire brought the fires death toll in New South Wales to eight since the start of October. 
Ten more firefighters were seriously injured on Thursday, with four in South Australia being treated for burns and smoke inhalation.
""The worst imaginable set of circumstances unfolded,"" New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. ""This hurts everybody to the core.""
Shortly after the pair's deaths were announced, Morrison issued a statement saying he would return as soon as possible from a family holiday in Hawaii, a trip that has drawn sharp criticism in recent days as the wildfires crisis deepened.
""I deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,"" Morrison said in the statement.
Morrison later told 2GB radio that the trip had been planned as a surprise to his young daughters to replace leave originally scheduled for January that he had canceled because of official trips to Japan and India.
CATASTROPHIC FIRE HAZARD
His return comes as firefighters prepare for ""catastrophic"" fire danger - the most severe level - in NSW on Saturday as searing heat and high winds are forecast, leading officials to urge people to evacuate their homes early if they live close to bushland. 
""It is a fairly strong likelihood that we will lose homes tomorrow, it would be a miracle if we don't,"" RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers told reporters in Sydney.
There are more than 200 fires burning across Australia - 70 of which are classified as uncontrolled, mostly in NSW.
In South Australia, more than 120 blazes have broken out in catastrophic conditions. Bracing for more potential fatalities, authorities said an emergency fire in Lameroo, 210 km (130.5 miles) east of Adelaide may pose a threat to lives directly in its path and urged residents to flee now. 
Morrison's conservative Liberal-National coalition government has been under sustained pressure to defend its climate change policies as it has downplayed links to the unprecedented early arrival and severity of this year's bushfire season.
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Morrison's Sydney residence on Thursday. One protestor, wearing an Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, ""ScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?"" referencing the leader's nickname and a well-known international advertisement for Tourism Australia.
Australia is one of the world’s largest carbon emitters per capita because of its reliance on coal-fired power plants. It has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but critics accuse Morrison of paying lip service to that commitment.
In June, the government approved the construction of a new coal mine in Queensland state by India's Adani Enterprises that is expected to produce 8 million to 10 million tonnes of thermal coal a year.
As Morrison was apologizing on radio on Friday morning, opposition Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese was serving breakfast to firefighters near the front line of a fire in rural Bilpin.
CHRISTMAS TRAVEL WARNING
The fires have resulted in days of heavy pollution in Sydney, pushing air quality to unprecedented hazardous levels and resulting in viral images of heavy smoke haze over the usually sparkling harbor and landmarks like the Opera House.
The fires are being spurred this week, by record temperatures across the country which led NSW, the most populous state with 7 million people, to declare a seven-day state of emergency.
Thursday's declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities.
Days out from Christmas, a time when many Australians head to the coast for the holidays, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people to reconsider travel plans.
""What is most important for us is that everyone is safe and if that means changing your plans for Christmas, we ask you do to that,"" Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 02:46AM ET</span>",Philippine raid nabs 342 illegal Chinese gaming workers,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine authorities said on Friday they arrested 342 Chinese workers in a raid on an unlicensed gambling operation, part of a crackdown on illegal migration and an illicit gaming industry that is being fueled by mainland China's appetite for betting.
Licensed online gaming operations introduced in 2016 have been a boon in bringing money to the Philippine economy, but illegal businesses attracting massive numbers of Chinese migrants have also mushroomed, due largely to vested interests, corruption and weak law enforcement.
Illegal operations far outnumber those being regulated, and do not pay no tax. Law enforcement bodies and the Chinese government suspect some are fronts for crime, including money laundering.
The Chinese arrested late on Thursday were at a registered gambling firm that had yet to secure a license from the state gaming regulator. 
""We had reason to suspect that the company is a front for illegal cyber activities and investment scams,"" said Fortunato Manahan, chief of the Bureau of Immigration's intelligence division.
Though Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has good relations with China, where gambling is prohibited, he has refused its request to ban gaming operations that cater to mainland Chinese. 
Chinese gaming companies and their employees have been blamed for driving up office and residential rent, so much so that Makati City, Manila's main business hub, has banned the issue of new licenses to gaming firms.
In August, Cambodia heeded Chinese pressure to ban online gambling, which has drawn both Chinese investment and crime to the country.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 01:55AM ET</span>",'Before it is too late': Diplomats race to defuse tensions ahead of North Korea's deadline,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - A last minute flurry of diplomacy aimed at engaging with North Korea ahead of its declared year-end deadline for talks has been met with stony silence from Pyongyang so far, with the looming crisis expected to top the agenda at summits in China next week.
The U.S. special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, was due to leave Beijing on Friday after meeting with Chinese officials. Earlier in the week, Biegun also made stops in Seoul and Tokyo for discussions with counterparts.
It is unclear if Biegun had any behind-the-scenes contact with North Korean officials, but his overtures and calls for new talks were not publicly answered by Pyongyang.
Biegun's trip came as China and Russia teamed up this week to propose a resolution that would ease some United Nations Security Council sanctions on North Korea as a way to jumpstart talks.
Next week, Chinese, South Korean and Japanese leaders are due to meet in China, with North Korea likely to top the agenda.
""It's kind of creepy that there haven't been any statements from high level (North Korea) Foreign Ministry officials this week...,"" Jenny Town, managing editor at the North Korea monitoring website 38 North, said on Twitter. ""The silence, even after Biegun's speech in Seoul, makes me concerned.""
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has given the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions in talks over North Korea's nuclear arsenal and reducing tensions between the long-time adversaries.
North Korea has said it is up to the United States to decide what ""Christmas gift"" it will receive this year, without specifying what Kim's decision may be.
The prospect that 2020 may see a return to heightened tensions and major missile or weapons tests by North Korea has led politicians, diplomats, and analysts around the world to debate how to salvage diplomacy after U.S. President Donald Trump's unprecedented summits with Kim over the past two years failed to make a breakthrough.
On Wednesday, four leading Democrats in the U.S. Senate wrote a letter to Trump arguing that U.S. efforts to establish peace on the peninsula and denuclearize North Korea ""appear to be stalled and on the brink of failure"".
""We reiterate our hope that you will execute a serious diplomatic plan before it is too late,"" the letter said.
'THE BEST PLAN'
The Senate Democrats' letter called for the administration to seek an interim agreement to freeze and roll back some of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes in conjunction with reduced pressure from sanctions.
""While such an agreement would of course only be a first step in a longer process, it would nonetheless be an important effort to create the sort of real and durable diplomatic process that is necessary,"" they wrote.
China and Russia on Monday introduced a joint proposal that calls on the U.N. Security Council to lift some sanctions on exports and foreign workers, with Chinese officials calling it the ""the best plan in the current situation to resolve the stalemate"".
The United States has said it is opposed to any sanctions relief at the moment, but has also said it is willing to be flexible in discussions.
Meanwhile, analysts at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank that has often advocated for a hard line against countries such as North Korea and Iran, called for the Trump administration to turn to implement a ""maximum pressure 2.0"" campaign.
The United States should increase sanctions, target North Korea with offensive cyber operations, and carry out an ""aggressive"" information campaign against the country, the foundation wrote in a report earlier in December.
A study commissioned by peace activists reported last month that sanctions were disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations in North Korea.
The report for Korea Peace Now! called for lifting all sanctions that may be violating international law or undermining human rights, and to ""urgently"" try to mitigate the impact on humanitarian efforts.
MILITARY TENSIONS
Recent weeks have seen some U.S. and North Korean officials discussing possible military actions once again.
Earlier this month, Trump angered North Korean officials by suggesting the United States could use military force ""if we have to.""
Those remarks led North Korea's army chief to warn that North Korea would take ""prompt corresponding actions at any level.""
North Korea launched several dozen short-range missiles in 2019, and the commander of U.S. air forces in the Pacific said this week that he suspects ""some kind of long-range missile"" could be North Korea's ""Christmas gift.""
Speaking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday, Gen. Charles Brown said the U.S. military could ""dust off pretty quickly and be ready to use"" options it had developed during the height of tensions in 2017.
""If the diplomatic efforts kind of fall apart, we've got to be ready...we're already thinking ahead,"" he said."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Breathing masks are selling out in Sydney with the city enveloped in the smoke from bushfires sweeping across a large swath of Australia's east coast, damaging the country's clean and green reputation.
Office workers wearing protective masks, previously a rarity, have become a common sight in recent weeks in downtown Sydney, where record pollution levels have consistently ranked the city above the likes of Jakarta, Shanghai and Mumbai.
The world-famous Opera House and Harbour Bridge have regularly been shrouded by thick smoke that has turned the daytime sky a dark orange. Ash has fallen like a shroud over the sky, propelled by strong winds from the fires burning on the outskirts of greater Sydney.
Australia has been fighting wildfires across the country's east coast for weeks, with blazes killing eight people - including two firefighters overnight - destroying more than 700 homes and razing nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland.
State health officials have warned people with respiratory conditions to stay inside as much as possible, but health experts said that advice is not a good enough response given the crises has now been running for weeks.
""It breaks my heart when I see my patients because they're like my family and when I see that they're being punished by the smoke and heat I have felt powerless,"" family doctor Kim Loo told protesters at a rally outside Prime Minister Scott Morrison's Sydney residence on Thursday.
""I've gone to government for the last five years, state and federal, and it looks as though we have no health policies to deal with climate change federally.""
Bunnings Warehouse, one of Australia's largest retailers, said some of its stores have run out of breathing masks amid warnings the smoke pollution could impact lung function and lead to the development of respiratory diseases.
""We’re working closely with suppliers to get more masks into impacted areas,"" Bunnings regional operations manager Robyn Hudson said in an emailed statement.
Morrison's conservative Liberal-National coalition government has come under sustained pressure to defend its climate change policies as it has downplayed links to the unprecedented early arrival and severity of this year's bushfire season.
Morrison cut short a family holiday in Hawaii on Friday to head back to Sydney amid the criticism, as worries grew about Australia's own tourism credentials.
""Australia's reputation as clean and green has been a major contributor to luring tourists,"" said David Beirman, senior lecturer in tourism at the University of Technology in Sydney. ""The longer this crisis goes on, the more damage it will have to that image and potentially on tourism.""
HEALTH EFFECTS
Medical experts said the health damage to both locals and tourists could be long-running and difficult to immediately diagnose.
Edward Jegasothy, an expert at the University of Sydney's school of public health, said one of the biggest risks came from invisible small particles suspended in the atmosphere that are produced from the burning of wood.
Those particles, which can travel long distances, can get down into the lungs and bloodstream, causing inflammation and other system effects, Jegasothy told Reuters.
""When air pollution is short, it's easy to tell people, give people advice about how to avoid it, stay indoors, avoid physical activity,"" he said.
""But when it's sustained over a number of days or weeks, then the messaging becomes more complicated.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft made a rare compassionate public gesture toward her Iranian counterpart in the U.N. Security Council chamber on Thursday. 
Since Washington pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, tensions between the United States and Tehran have risen.
But after a contentious U.N. Security Council meeting on compliance with the 2015 accord between world powers and Iran, Craft walked over to talk to Iran's U.N. Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi.
Ravanchi had spoken about a two-year old girl during his statement to the 15-member council. He said the girl had died in June from a rare disease and blamed the death on U.S. sanctions.
An official from the U.S. mission to the United Nations said Craft was expressing her condolences to Ravanchi.
Since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the nuclear deal, his administration has reimposed sanctions on Tehran with the aim of choking Iranian crude oil sales, the Islamic Republic's main source of revenues.
But as part of its 'maximum pressure' campaign, Washington has also sanctioned dozens of Iranian entities, companies and individuals to cut Tehran's revenue, a move some analysts have suggested may have forced Iran to act more aggressively.
Ravanchi had told the council: ""It is a shame that the U.S. bullying has resulted in discontinuation of export of certain medicines to Iran, causing nightmare for some patients.""
""For instance, a European company, under the pressure of US sanctions, has stopped exporting special bandages for patients suffering from EB, a rare genetic condition resulting in easy blistering of the skin,"" he said. 
He then went on to tell the council that the Iranian toddler, named Ava, was unable to get the treatment she needed.
Craft had told the Security Council: ""The United States is willing to engage in dialogue with Iran to negotiate a deal that will better serve international peace and security. But we will not sit idly by while Iran continues to destabilize the region.""

The Trump administration has complained that the 2015 accord did not go far enough in restricting Iran's missile program or its proxy wars in the Middle East.

The Public Administration Ministry (SFP) opened the probe into Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) Chief Executive Manuel Bartlett after media reports said he had not fully disclosed the extent of his wealth in official declarations, or his ties to certain companies, including one offering electricity services and another that won a contract under the current government.
The allegations against Bartlett, a veteran and sometimes divisive figure in Mexican politics, were a potential embarrassment to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office last December vowing to root out entrenched corruption.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist who tapped Bartlett for his current role, had said the CFE boss was under attack by adversaries when the allegations first surfaced in reports by Mexican journalists Areli Quintero and Carlos Loret de Mola.
Irma Sandoval, the head of the SFP, said that Bartlett had filed his wealth declarations correctly.
""From the records we collected ... it does not follow that Mr. Manuel Bartlett Diaz has had any kind of conflict of interest,"" she told reporters.
Sandoval said Bartlett had no administrative involvement with the companies about which he had been questioned, and that he was not obligated to disclose properties belonging to children or partners who were not dependents, referring to his declarations.
The SFP had acted independently in the case, she added.
""There are no untouchables,"" she said. ""We're taking action, and will keep taking action with the law in our hands.""
Bartlett is well known in Mexico for announcing during the 1988 presidential election that the vote-counting computers had crashed as the main opposition candidate was in the lead.
At the time, Bartlett was interior minister for the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
When the computers came back online, the PRI candidate had won, drawing accusations of fraud from critics."

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's ambitious firearm amnesty ends on Friday with questions over its success, as critics say the police only managed to collect about a third of the weapons that were outlawed after the Christchurch massacre.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern banned semi-automatic weapons and launched a gun amnesty and buyback scheme earlier this year, after a March shooting in Christchurch where a suspected white supremacist gunned down 51 Muslims in two mosques.
More than 56,346 prohibited guns have been removed from circulation so far, within the range estimated by consultancy KPMG in an independent report, Police Minister Stuart Nash said in a statement.
""However police have consistently warned the problem is we just don’t know exactly how many guns are out in the community,"" Nash said.
Ardern is pushing a new set of gun reforms through parliament which includes the creation of a registry to monitor every firearm legally held in New Zealand.
Nash said about 31,650 people had taken part in the amnesty so far and almost NZ$100 million ($66.1 million) had been paid in compensation to gun owners.
Almost 188,000 prohibited gun parts were also surrendered. Nash said after today gun owners would not be paid for their prohibited firearms.
""Those in breach of the law face risk of prosecution and up to five years jail, as well as the loss of their license,"" he said.
Voluntary surrender of firearms would continue.
Opposition leaders and gun lobby groups called the amnesty a failure.
""Its not a number to be boasting about. It's not successful,"" Council of Licenced Firearms Owners (COLFO) spokeswoman Nicole McKee told reporters.
The council estimates 170,000 semi-automatic weapons were in circulation before the amnesty was announced.
""Despite our best efforts to encourage compliance, we know owners have been so disappointed by the settings of the ban and its poor implementation that many can’t bring themselves to comply,"" McKee said in a statement.
The opposition National Party said the amnesty had collected less than a third of what police and firearm stakeholders had previously advised could be out there.
""The government made a mistake in targeting law-abiding firearms owners when they should’ve targeted the gangs who peddle misery in communities across New Zealand,"" National Party spokesman Mark Mitchell said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has approved a resumption of Pakistan's participation in a coveted U.S. military training and educational program more than a year after it was suspended, the State Department said on Thursday.
The decision to resume Islamabad's participation in the International Military Education and Training Program, or IMET - for more than a decade a pillar of U.S.-Pakistani military ties - underscores warming relations that have followed meetings this year between U.S. President Donald Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.
Washington also has credited Islamabad with helping to facilitate negotiations on a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. The talks recently resumed between the United States and the Taliban, who U.S. officials say receive sanctuary and other aid from the Pakistan's military-led intelligence agency. Pakistan denies the charge.
The State Department administers IMET. It was a small facet of U.S. security aid programs for Pakistan worth some $2 billion that remain suspended on orders that Trump abruptly issued in January 2018 to compel the nuclear-armed South Asian nation to crackdown on Islamist militants. Trump's decision, announced in a tweet, blindsided U.S. officials.
After an attack earlier this year by a Pakistan-based extremist group that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary troops, U.S. officials called on Islamabad to take ""sustained and irreversible action"" against militants operating from its territory.
A State Department spokeswoman said in an email that Trump's 2018 decision to suspend security assistance authorized ""narrow exceptions for programs that support vital U.S. national security interests."" The decision to restore Pakistani participation in IMET was ""one such exception,"" she said.
The program ""provides an opportunity to increase bilateral cooperation between our countries on shared priorities,"" she added. ""We want to continue to build on this foundation through concrete actions that advance regional security and stability.""
A second U.S. official said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan was in the process of selecting officers to send to the United States.
The restart of the program, however, is subject to approval by Congress. Republican and Democratic aides for the Senate and House of Representatives committees with jurisdiction over the process did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
IMET affords spaces to foreign military officers at U.S. military education institutions, such as the U.S. Army War College and the U.S. Naval War College.
Pakistan's suspension from the program in August 2018 prompted the cancellation of 66 slots set aside that year for Pakistani military officers in one of the first known impacts of Trump's decision to halt security assistance.
The U.S. military traditionally has sought to shield such educational programs from political tensions, arguing that the ties built by bringing foreign military officers to the United States pay long-term dividends."
216,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 07:58PM ET</span>",Fishermen cry foul as China bids to fix drought-hit lake,"By David Stanway
WUCHENG, China (Reuters) - After wading through mudflats, Fan Xinde, a 36-year-old fisherman, sifts old copper coins from the debris scooped from the bed of a dwindling river that feeds China's biggest freshwater lake, the Poyang.
As residents fled invading Japanese troops 80 years ago, the coins were packed into boxes and sent down the river on rafts, with many sinking without trace. They are now being unearthed as the water in the Poyang recedes to its lowest level in decades, providing a small income for fishermen like Fan facing an uncertain future.
On Jan. 1 2020, China will ban fishing in environmentally sensitive regions along the Yangtze, China's longest river, and by the start of 2021, fishing throughout the Poyang itself will be prohibited for at least 10 years.
Fan, who has worked half his life on the lake, said he and as many as 100,000 other fishermen were being unfairly blamed for mounting local environmental problems and must now find other ways to make a living.
""Our sources of income have been cut off. We don't have anything else,"" he said. ""To be honest, we shouldn't be collecting the coins at all because they are owned by the state, but it is only a tiny amount.""
The government says excessive fishing has brought stocks down to perilously low levels and put endangered species under threat, including China's last surviving river mammal, the Yangtze finless porpoise.
But the Poyang, described by President Xi Jinping as a vital ""kidney"" filtering the water supplies of 40% of China's population, has also been hurt by intensive sand mining, untreated wastewater and the impact of the giant Three Gorges Dam some 560km (350 miles) upstream.
Water in the Poyang, which spills off from the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in Jiangxi province, routinely declines in winter. But the lake is now at its lowest in 60 years. With little rain since July, hundreds of shriveled anchovies and tiny shellfish have been baked into the exposed shoreline flats.
DAMS AND QUARRIES
Residents blame the Three Gorges Project for the problems facing the lake, with its vast 660km-long (410 mile-long) reservoir storing huge volumes of water behind a giant dam for power generation.
""The Three Gorges is blocking off all the water,"" said Zhang Yingsheng, a 59-year old fisherman picking clams from the edge of the lake. ""Every winter is like this now, but this year is especially low because of the drought.""
With the 181-metre (600-foot) dam reducing the Yangtze's flow in winter, water from the Poyang drains quickly and easily back into the river.
But the primary cause of problems is the two decades of intensive sand mining in the Poyang, said David Shankman, professor at the University of Alabama, who studies the lake.
""Sand mining has made the drainage channel (in the northern part of the lake) deeper and wider"" accelerating the draining, he said.
Zhang said quarrying by giant dredgers had hit fishing hard, with deeper lake beds making it harder for fishermen to deploy their nets. The sand industry had also damaged the lake's ecosystem, he said.
According to policy plans seen by Reuters, the local government is already working to reduce mining activity in the Poyang after banning it in the Yangtze River two decades ago.
Annual sand production will be limited to 39.9 million tonnes from 2019-2024, down 26.9% compared to the 2014-2018 period. Dredgers will be permitted to mine 65 square km (25 square miles) of the lake area, a quarter of the previous level.
The new policy was a sign officials had recognized sand mining had become a serious environmental liability, Shankman said, but simply stopping the activity wouldn't automatically solve the problems.
""It depends not only on the extent of the mining, and not on the total area of the mining, but where they are mining,"" he said.
IRREVERSIBLE
China is in the middle of a campaign aimed at ending big and ""destructive"" development along the Yangtze. President Xi said restoring the Poyang was a crucial element of the plan to revitalize regions along the river's banks.
But experts say many of the devastating changes to the lake are irreversible.
Even before the Three Gorges Dam and the sand mining boom, the lake had already shrunk considerably as a result of an earlier campaign to reclaim farmland and curb floods through the use of dykes and diversions.
""Everything in the lake has been dramatically altered by landscape change, dams and sand mining,"" said Shankman. ""The amount of water in the lake, in the Yangtze River, the sediment going in and going out - everything is affected by human activity."""

Conde has governed since 2010, and his second and final five-year term finishes next year. Demonstrations since October against a possible constitutional change have resulted in at least 14 deaths across the country.
The opposition suspects 81-year-old Conde plans to use a new constitution as a reset button on the current two-term limit. A proposed draft for a new constitution, seen by Reuters, does not explicitly state whether Conde would be eligible for the 2020 election, but Conde has refused to rule out running.
In a televised address on Thursday evening, Conde said the presidents of the National Assembly and the constitutional court had signed off on the proposal, which was drafted by a special commission.
""This proposal will be the subject of a broad public outreach campaign before its adoption by the sovereign people,"" he said, without specifying when the referendum would take place.
Conde says a new constitution is needed to replace the 2010 version, which he says was hastily drafted in an efforts to end coup leader Dadis Camara's brief tenure.
Conde's election victory in 2010 raised hopes for democratic progress in Guinea after decades of authoritarian rule. But his critics accuse him of cracking down on dissent and violently repressing protests - charges he denies."

Xi is also due to announce policies aimed at diversifying the former Portuguese colony's casino-dependent economy, in what is being seen as a reward for its loyalty, in contrast to nearby Hong Kong and its months of anti-government turmoil.
The measures are expected to include a new yuan-denominated stock exchange.
Xi's speech will be closely watched and comes on the last day of a three-day visit marked by stringent security measures and border controls aimed at preventing any spillover of dissent from the former British colony of Hong Kong.
Some journalists, activists and even the heads of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong were barred from entering the city in the run up to Xi's visit. Macau authorities have not commented on the issue.
Ferry and light rail services have been restricted for the visit with operators citing security concerns. 
Incoming Macau chief executive Ho Iat-seng will be sworn in for a five-year term along with his team of new secretaries in the morning. 
Macau returned to Chinese rule on Dec. 20, 1999, with the same ""one country, two systems"" formula aimed at preserving autonomy under which Hong Kong is governed. 
While protesters in Hong Kong, across the mouth of the Pearl River, are furious by what they see as Beijing's erosion of their freedoms, Macau has seen little dissent.
Protests are very rare in the territory. More than half of its 620,000 population immigrated from China in recent decades.
Macau's cluster of islands have been decked out ahead of the anniversary with national flags and red banners hanging over schools, office towers and draped along roads.
Xi has met government officials and business representatives and visited schools and community centers and he praised Macau for upholding national security, according to the official Xinhua news agency Xinhua.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 06:13PM ET</span>","U.S. deports Mexicans far from border, may send others to Guatemala","By Ted Hesson and Frank Jack Daniel
WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States began flying Mexican deportees to the interior of Mexico on Thursday and a senior U.S. official said Mexicans seeking U.S. asylum could be sent to Guatemala, as the Trump administration seeks to further limit border crossings.
The flight carrying Mexican deportees from Tucson, Arizona, landed in Guadalajara around midday. One immigration shelter in the city said it had been informed of a likely influx of deportees.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made clamping down on unlawful migration a top priority of his three-year-old term in office and his looming 2020 reelection campaign.
Numbers of Central American migrants apprehended at the border fell sharply in the second part of 2019 after Mexico deployed National Guard troops to stem the flow, under pressure from Trump.
With fewer Central Americans at the border, U.S. attention has turned to Mexicans crossing illegally or asking for asylum. Around 150,000 Mexican single adults were apprehended at the border in fiscal 2019, sharply down from previous decades but still enough to bother U.S. immigration hawks.
In another sign of the new focus on Mexicans, Acting Deputy U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said an agreement that sends U.S. asylum seekers to Guatemala to request U.S. refuge could also apply to Mexicans and other nationalities.
""As we fully implement the agreement, all populations are being considered, including Mexican nationals,"" Cuccinelli said on Twitter.
Mexico's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
FLIGHTS
Mexico said it had requested the flights to keep deportees away from dangerous border cities, while a senior DHS official said the flights were in response to rising numbers of Mexican nationals arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Mexicans made up nearly half of all migrants caught between October and December, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.
John Sandweg, a former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Obama administration, said the program would help stop Mexican migrants from simply crossing again once they had been deported.
""It's a lot cheaper to just return Mexicans across the border,"" he said. ""But the real benefit is the recidivism rate."" A bus ride from Guadalajara to Nogales, a Mexican border city across from the U.S. state of Arizona, can take more than a day. 
The flights could be scaled up quickly in the coming weeks, said the DHS official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Mexican foreign ministry said the flights would begin on a regular basis in January.
The U.S. official added the return flights may expand beyond Guadalajara, Mexico's second-biggest city, to other parts of Mexico.

The United States has in recent years mainly deported Mexicans to border towns, although in the past it also flew them to cities in the interior.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 06:09PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. probe of Saudi oil attack shows it came from north - report,"By Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said new evidence and analysis of weapons debris recovered from an attack on Saudi oil facilities on Sept. 14 indicates the strike likely came from the north, reinforcing its earlier assessment that Iran was behind the offensive.
In an interim report of its investigation - seen by Reuters ahead of a presentation on Thursday to the United Nations Security Council - Washington assessed that before hitting its targets, one of the drones traversed a location approximately 200 km (124 miles) to the northwest of the attack site.
""This, in combination with the assessed 900 kilometer maximum range of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), indicates with high likelihood that the attack originated north of Abqaiq,"" the interim report said, referring to the location of one of the Saudi oil facilities that were hit.
It added the United States had identified several similarities between the drones used in the raid and an Iranian designed and produced unmanned aircraft known as the IRN-05 UAV.
However, the report noted that the analysis of the weapons debris did not definitely reveal the origin of the strike that initially knocked out half of Saudi Arabia's oil production. 
""At this time, the U.S. Intelligence Community has not identified any information from the recovered weapon systems used in the 14 September attacks on Saudi Arabia that definitively reveals an attack origin,"" it said.
The new findings include freshly declassified information, a State Department official told Reuters.
The United States, European powers and Saudi Arabia blamed the Sept. 14 attack on Iran. Yemen's Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks, and Iran, which supports the Houthis, denied any involvement. Yemen is south of Saudi Arabia.
OIL PRICE SPIKE
Reuters reported last month that Iran's leadership approved the attacks but decided to stop short of a direct confrontation that could trigger a devastating U.S. response. It opted instead to hit the Abqaiq and the Khurais oil plants of U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, according to three officials familiar with the meetings and a fourth close to Iran’s decision making.
According to the Reuters report a Middle East source, who was briefed by a country investigating the attack, said the launch site was the Ahvaz air base in southwest Iran, which is about 650 km north of Abqaiq.
Some of the craft flew over Iraq and Kuwait en route to the attack, according to a Western intelligence source cited by the report, giving Iran plausible deniability.
The 17-minute strike by 18 drones and three low-flying missiles caused a spike in oil prices, fires and damage and shut down more than 5% of global oil supply. Saudi Arabia said on Oct. 3 that it had fully restored oil output.
U.S. Special Envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, told Reuters that the newly-declassified information was more evidence that Tehran was behind the attack. ""The UAVs flew into Saudi Arabia from the north, and the recovered debris is consistent with Iranian-produced materiel,"" he said.
""As many nations have concluded, there are no plausible alternatives to Iranian responsibility,"" he said.
The United States presented its findings to a session of the U.N. Security Council on Thursday as it hopes to mobilize more support for its policy to isolate Iran and force it to the negotiating table for a new nuclear deal.
""The damage at the oil facilities shows that the attack came from the north, not from the south, as you would expect if the Houthis were responsible,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft told the Security Council on Thursday.
UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo stressed to the council that the United Nations was still reviewing components and collecting and analyzing additional information on the missiles. 
DRONE PARTS 'NEARLY IDENTICAL' 
In a similar report last week, the United Nations also said it was ""unable to independently corroborate"" that missiles and drones used in attacks on Saudi oil facilities in September ""are of Iranian origin.""
The report noted that Yemen’s Houthis “have not shown to be in possession, nor been assessed to be in possession” of the type of drones used in the attacks on the Aramco (SE:2222) facilities.
Washington's interim assessment also included pictures of drone components including the engine identified by the United States as ""closely resembling"" or ""nearly identical"" to those that observed on other Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles.
It also provided pictures of a compass circuit board that was recovered from the attack with a marking that is likely indicating a potential manufacturing date written in the Persian calendar year, the report assessed.
The name of a company believed to be associated with Iran, SADRA, was also identified on a wiring harness label from the Sept. 14 wreckage, the report said.
U.S. President Donald Trump last year withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran and snapped back sanctions on Tehran with the aim of choking Iranian crude sales, the Islamic Republic's main source of revenues.
As part of its 'maximum pressure' campaign, Washington has also sanctioned dozens of Iranian entities, companies and individuals to cut Tehran's revenue, a move some analysts have suggested may have forced Iran to act more aggressively.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The son of Russian spies who was born in Canada and was stripped of his citizenship after his parents were arrested for espionage in the United States was affirmed as a Canadian citizen by the country's top court on Thursday.
Canada's Supreme Court unanimously upheld an earlier federal court ruling that said a 2014 administrative decision to strip Alexander Vavilov of his citizenship was unreasonable.
The hit TV series ""The Americans"" was inspired in part by the story of Vavilov's family. His parents came to Canada in the 1980s under deep cover and assumed names, with the mission to immerse themselves in Western society as a sleeper cell that would activate on orders from Moscow.
The family later moved to Boston, where Vavilov's parents were arrested in 2010 and charged with spying. Vavilov's parents returned to Russia in a spy swap. Both Alexander and his older brother Timothy also were sent there.
""They didn't speak a word of Russian,"" said lawyer Hadayt Nazami, who represented Vavilov. ""They didn't even know they had a Russian grandmother or that their parents were Russian.""
Vavilov was born in Toronto in 1994, as was his brother, Timothy, four years earlier. The ruling will apply to both, Nazami said.
Vavilov will be in Toronto on Friday and is expected to speak to reporters in the afternoon, Nazami said.
""My understanding is that both brothers want to settle in Canada,"" Nazami told Reuters. ""It will take time logistically, and they will be looking for work.""
Children born in Canada normally automatically become Canadian citizens, but the Registrar of Citizenship said Alexander was an exception because his parents - as employees of a foreign government - were like diplomats.
The Supreme Court upheld a previous federal appeals court ruling saying that Vavilov's parents did not enjoy the ""privileges and immunities"" of diplomats and so the exception could not be applied to their son.
Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova used the aliases Donald Heathfield and Tracey Ann Foley — names lifted from two Canadian children who had died in infancy. They later admitted their real names to U.S. authorities.
The Vavilova brothers ""thought it was a case of mistaken identity"" when their parents were arrested, Nazami said. ""When their parents admitted to the charges, they were in a taxi and heard it on the radio."""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday that the U.S. government should not finalize a trade deal with China unless the pact also secured the release of two Canadians detained by Beijing. 
The two men were picked up separately in December 2018, shortly after police in Vancouver held Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. arrest warrant. The two Canadians face state security charges.
Trudeau said Canada has been working with Washington in a bid to convince China to release the two men: businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig.
""We have said that the United States should not sign a final and complete agreement with China that does not settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians,"" Trudeau told Quebec television station TVA.
It was unclear whether Trudeau was referring to the so-called Phase 1 deal between China and the United States, which has yet to be signed, or a more complete agreement. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that the two sides would sign the Phase 1 trade pact, which calls for U.S. farm product exports to China to double over the next two years, at the beginning of January.
Joseph Crook, a spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, said Washington was deeply concerned by the arrest of the two Canadians.

""President Trump and other senior officials have called for the release of the two detained Canadians in meetings with the highest levels of the Chinese government,"" he said by email.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's Congress on Thursday gave the green light to a referendum on changing the country's constitution next year, a central demand of protesters whose mobilizations brought the nation virtually to a standstill over the past eight weeks.
The plan was approved in the lower house on Wednesday and by senators on Thursday, though an opposition request for quotas to ensure the participation of women, indigenous people and non-political representatives in the body that could draw up a new charter was shelved after pushback from right wing groups.
Chile's constitution dates back to General Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 military dictatorship. Critics of the constitution say it fails to guarantee proper healthcare, education and citizen participation in government, while supporters consider it a pillar of stability for one of the region's strongest and most investor-friendly economies.
In April voters will be asked whether they approve the idea of a new constitution and whether the body that draws up the new document should be a popularly elected assembly or one mixed with current lawmakers.
A poll by Cadem last month suggested that 82% of Chileans believe the country needs a new constitution and 60% want it drawn up by a popularly elected assembly, compared to 35% who want a mix with politicians.
Senator Alvaro Elizalde, president of Chile's Socialist Party, said his members would work to convince Chileans of the need for a new constitution drawn up by a popularly picked body.
""That way, we will have for the first time in our history a constitution drawn up in a time of democracy through popular participation,"" he told journalists after the vote.
Socialist Senator Isabel Allende, daughter of former President Salvador Allende, said she would lodge a reform motion to include quotas for women and indigenous people in any body drawing up a new charter.
""We believe that if there is a crisis in this country it's as a result of the lack of representation, it's not good enough. People want to participate and be listened to,"" she said."

Magistrate Juan José Mendoza announced the ruling that voting remotely on legislation violates the Venezuelan constitution which requires a lawmaker be present. Mendoza also urged the Prosecutor's Office to investigate the National Assembly's decision on Tuesday, citing potential criminal conduct.
National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó is seeking reelection on Jan. 5, a year after invoking the Constitution to be interim president on the grounds that President Nicolas Maduro was re-elected in fraudulent elections. Government opponents accuse Maduro of trying to close the only institution controlled by the opposition.
About 30 National Assembly opposition members are abroad or in hiding due to judicial proceedings that government critics say are aimed at silencing adversaries. Previously, the legislature could not approve measures without the physical presence of 50% of the legislators or their substitutes.
On Wednesday three legislators who split from the opposition amid allegations of accepting bribes from the ruling Socialist party asked the Supreme Court to void the National Assembly decision."
226,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: The Brits who won't Brexit,"By Clare Baldwin
(Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a thumping election victory last week on a campaign to ""get Brexit done,"" but not before some wealthy donors to his Conservative Party quietly took steps to stay inside the European Union.
Cyprus government documents seen by Reuters show that Conservative Party donors have sought citizenship of the island, an EU member state, since Britain voted to leave the bloc in 2016.
They include billionaire Alan Howard, one of Britain's best-known hedge fund managers, and Jeremy Isaacs, the former head of Lehman Brothers for Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Cyprus' interior ministry recommended that both men's applications be approved, the government documents show.
The Conservative Party won another term in office last week after an election campaign that was dominated by Brexit. Johnson called the election to try to gain a majority in Parliament to push through his plan to take Britain out of the EU early next year.
That some Brits who made a career out of assessing risk have applied for second passports may suggest sagging confidence in Britain's economy after it leaves the EU. A broker who makes his living handling such passports says he's seen a surge of enquiries from Brits looking for ways to keep their European Union citizenship.
""Brexit is the only factor driving this,"" says Paul Williams (NYSE:WMB), chief executive of passport brokerage La Vida Golden Visas. The right to live, work, study or set up business anywhere in Europe, says Williams, ""that all changes with Brexit.""
According to Britain's Electoral Commission, Howard donated at least £129,000 to the Conservative Party personally and through his company between 2005 and 2009. Isaacs made personal and corporate donations of at least £626,500 to the party, £50,000 of it earmarked for The In Campaign, a group lobbying to remain in the EU.
The Cyprus government documents show that Howard, and Isaacs and his wife all sought Cypriot citizenship in 2018. A spokesperson for Howard declined to comment. Isaacs did not respond to requests for comment. His assistant said he was traveling and unavailable. The Conservative Party didn't respond to requests for comment.
Britain voted narrowly to leave the European Union in 2016 but the details of the country's future relationship with the bloc are still unclear. Economists have said Britain will be economically poorer under every form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU.
Cypriot citizenship costs a minimum of 2 million euros of which at least 500,000 euros must be permanently invested. At no point in the application process is the applicant compelled to live in – or even visit – Cyprus. Cyprus is popular with people seeking a second passport because the entire investment can be in real estate, and it has low taxes.
The Cyprus government documents reviewed by Reuters also list a man named David John Rowland as having sought citizenship. The documents that name Rowland contain scant details, showing only that he applied for a Cypriot passport as part of an investor group. Separate Cypriot company records list a UK national David John Rowland as a director of a company called Abledge Ltd, which was registered on Dec. 31, 2015. These records show Rowland's home address to be on the British tax haven island of Guernsey - the home of the David John Rowland who is a Conservative Party donor, former Party treasurer, property developer and financial adviser to Prince Andrew. Reuters couldn't determine Abledge Ltd's line of business or any other information about the firm.
A spokesperson for a bank owned by Rowland, Banque Havilland, declined to comment. Repeated requests through another of Rowland's businesses and his personal email address went unanswered. A spokesperson for the palace declined to comment. The Cypriot government declined to comment about any of the individuals named in this story or on the status of a government review of its passports-for-sale scheme, citing EU privacy rules.
Electoral Commission records show that Rowland has donated at least £6.5 million to the Conservatives since 2001, £854,500 of it since the Brexit vote. Prime Minister David Cameron named him Tory treasurer and chief Conservative fundraiser after the millions of pounds he donated to the 2010 general election campaign - to protect Britain's ""liberty"" and economic future, Rowland told media at the time. He quit before officially taking up the post.
Isaacs was once seen as a successor to Dick Fuld, but ended up leaving Lehman shortly before the global financial crisis. In 2015, he became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire at the Queen's birthday honors.
Howard made billions on the 2008 financial crisis by predicting interest rate and currency moves, and profited again on the Brexit vote by accurately tracking voter sentiment, media reported.
When an emergency UK budget raised taxes on the wealthy in 2010, Howard moved to Switzerland. He has since returned to Britain. But last year the master of hedging hedged his bets against holding only British citizenship.

PARIS (Reuters) - French unions said strikes that have crippled the transport system will continue over the Christmas holidays after talks with the government on Thursday failed to break the deadlock over a planned overhaul of the pension system.
Two weeks of nationwide industrial action in France have disrupted railways and roads, shut some schools and brought more than half a million people onto the streets to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's wide-ranging reform plan.
After a meeting with Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, the leader of the hardline CGT union, Philippe Martinez, said unions had decided to hold more strikes and demonstrations on Jan. 9.
""The prime minister hasn't heard what the street is saying,"" Martinez told reporters.
Laurent Berger, leader of the more moderate CFDT, refrained from calling for demonstrations on Jan. 9 but said he still disagreed with the government's aim of encouraging people to work until age 64 before they draw a full pension.
Philippe told a news conference his government remains fully committed to restoring the financial balance of the pensions system and to ending special pension regimes under which some workers can retire up to a decade before others.
He said progress had been made with the unions and that he hoped any remaining disagreements could be overcome during new talks in January. Philippe hopes parliament can vote on the pension reform law by summer at the latest.
Philippe also reiterated a plea to unions to suspend transport strikes during the holidays.
""I call on unions to allow French people to travel to see their families over Christmas,"" he said.
But a statement from the CGT-led union coalition said there would be no return to work over the festive period, when millions of people rely on France's extensive network of high-speed trains to spend the holiday with their families.
UNSA, the second-biggest union at railway company SNCF, however called for a truce over Christmas, which could alleviate some transport misery.
Unions oppose Macron's plans to streamline France's state pension system and push people to work until 64, instead of the legal retirement age of 62."

The European Union has accused the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party of politicizing the judiciary ever since it came to power in 2015. PiS argues that the reforms are necessary to make Poland's courts more efficient.
The nationalist government has introduced draft legislation providing for the disciplining of judges who have questioned the independence of peers nominated by a panel set up under new rules drawn up by the PiS-dominated parliament.
The EU's top court said last month it was up to Poland's Supreme Court to decide whether the panel was independent, and the Supreme Court has ruled that in its view the panel was neither impartial nor independent.
One of PiS's smaller partners, Porozumienie, which depicts itself as a pro-business party, has since come under opposition pressure to partially block the reform. Porozumienie recently impeded another reform planned by the PiS.
On Thursday state news agency PAP quoted Porozumienie head Jaroslaw Gowin as saying that ruling politicians would adopt amendments to the bill aimed at removing its two most criticized parts.
These are disciplinary measures against judges questioning legitimacy of their peers appointed by the new panel, and a part of the bill that forced judges to reveal the names of social media accounts they use under pseudonyms.
""There's an agreement ... amendments (to the proposed bill) will be adopted,"" Gowin was quoted as saying by PAP.
On Wednesday thousands of people poured onto the streets to protest against what they saw as an attempt by PiS to further browbeat judges. On Thursday the lower house of parliament started the debate on the judicial reforms.
PiS, which won a second term in October, says it will continue the reforms to try to rid the judiciary of communist leftovers, despite EU criticism over adherence to the rule of law and threats to cut off vital EU funding.
During the parliamentary debate, opposition parties accused the PiS of using the new legislation as a tool to intimidate judges so they rule in line with the party's expectations.
""The real reason is your panic attempt to escape the accountability. You know that the time of your defeat is coming and you will be held accountable at Polish courts for all your scandals,"" opposition MP Borys Budka told deputies.

Parliament's Bureau Of Research on Tuesday wrote an opinion in which it said the draft law as it stood could be in breach of EU law, specifically calling into question the independence and impartiality of the court and judges.

Boyle was accused of attacking his estranged wife, Caitlan Coleman. He denied all charges and his lawyer alleged that it was Coleman who was the abusive one in the relationship.
Boyle's lawyer, Lawrence Greenspon, had argued there was enough reasonable doubt behind Coleman's account to make a guilty finding impossible.
Boyle and Coleman were kidnapped in October 2012 while backpacking in Afghanistan. They spent five years in captivity, during which their three children were born.
Boyle said a fourth child had been murdered and his spouse raped after their capture by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. The Taliban denied the accusations of rape and murder.
Boyle was arrested just months after the family returned to Canada."

Hundreds of people are believed to have left Europe to fight for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and many are now in detention camps waiting to be handed over to their countries of origin.
""The suspects ... are under investigation for the criminal offences of organizing a terrorist group, unlawful formation and joining of foreign paramilitary or paramilitary formations and terrorism,"" the office said in a statement.
""Some of these persons were sought on international arrest warrant by order of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina,"" the office said without saying how many people have arrived.
Bosnia's presidency chairman said early in December that 24 people were expected to return to Bosnia.
Authorities said they had carried out security checks on all returnees.
Bosnia has been preparing to take back and put on trial nine of its nationals suspected of fighting for IS in Syria since October but their repatriation has been postponed twice after Turkey carried out a military operation into northeastern Syria to fight Kurdish militia.
Under Bosnia's criminal code, citizens who leave to fight in foreign wars must be prosecuted under terrorism charges.

Lima (Reuters) - Peru's President Martin Vizcarra said he will seek to strengthen labor laws to take more ""concrete action"" against companies involved in workplace accidents after two teenaged employees died in a McDonald's Corp franchise at the weekend.
Vizcarra said in comments reported on local television that current fines for such accidents appeared to be ""insufficient.""
""We can't allow for these kind of accidents to happen and for there to be no comeback other than a fine,"" he said. ""If the law is insufficient for these cases, we have to correct it.""
All 29 McDonald's restaurants in Peru are closed while the fast-food chain's local operator, Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc, completes inspections following the deaths on Sunday of Alexandra Porras, 18, and Carlos Campo, 19.
Police said they were electrocuted in Pueblo Libre, a district of the capital, while cleaning the kitchen. The incident spurred local protests against McDonald's and claims on social media, by people who said they had worked for the chain, of unsafe working conditions, low wages and unpaid work.
Arcos Dorados said in a statement that it was ""deeply saddened"" by the employees' deaths and was fully cooperating with local authorities.
The company added in an email that it paid ""competitive"" salaries, took seriously concerns raised about working conditions and that workers' shifts never exceed eight hours and included an additional break time of one hour."

PARIS (Reuters) - Electric scooter rental companies in Paris have seen a flood of new customers as strikes against the government's pension reform plans crippled metro, bus and train networks.
Looking for alternative ways to get to work, Paris commuters have turned to walking, cycling, driving and using the electric scooters that have appeared in the city in the past two years.
""Since the beginning of the crisis our users increased by 500% because people need to travel, and we represent a real alternative to cars and today to public transport,"" said Driss Ibenmansour, manager of scooter rental company Bird France.
He said that before the strikes began on Dec. 5, people would typically use Bird scooters for the last mile between the subway station and work or home, but now use the scooters - called ""trotinettes"" in French - for the entire route.
Foreign-owned companies including Lime and Bird, which are based in the United States, operate about 15,000 electric scooters in Paris.
""There is no subway so either I walk, take a scoot, cycle or drive. But going by car takes time, and with a scooter we don't get tired,"" said 21-year old Kanto Andrianalitiain.
Alexandre Monsarrat said it took him 15 minutes to get home from work by scooter, compared to an hour by car in traffic jams caused by the strikes.
Lime said last week the number of trips per day had risen 90% during the strikes. Between Dec. 5 and Dec. 13, Lime saw a 530% increase in average new users and signed up 64,000 new customers, the company said.
Scooter operator Dott, which has 3,200 scooters in Paris, said new user numbers had risen tenfold during the strike.
Some commuters say that with rates of one euro to unlock a scooter and about 20 cents per minute to ride, scooter rentals can be expensive for everyday use over long distances, and some have bought their own.
   ""It is more practical to have your own scooter. It is cheaper and you always know where to find it,"" said Orianne Denot."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire on the headquarters of Russia's FSB security service in central Moscow on Thursday evening in a rare shooting incident that the FSB said had left at least one of its employees dead.
The attack happened shortly after President Vladimir Putin had delivered his annual news conference and while he was speaking at a Kremlin event designed to celebrate the work of the security services.
The FSB suspected the attack may have been planned to coincide with Putin's evening speech, a source close to the FSB told Reuters.
The FSB, Russia's domestic security service, said it had ""neutralised"" the gunman and was working to establish his identity, the Interfax news agency reported. It was not immediately clear what his motive was. 
Footage posted on social media showed automatic gunfire hitting the walls of the FSB's main building on Lubyanka Square (NYSE:SQ) in central Moscow. Sirens, gunshots and screams were heard by people in the area, which is also a busy shopping district popular with tourists that is a short walk from the Kremlin. 
The FSB, which Putin used to head, said several people had been wounded in the attack. Interfax cited the Health Ministry as saying five people had been hurt, some of them seriously, including two FSB employees. 
Russian investigators said in a statement they had opened a criminal case into the attempted murder of law enforcement officers.
Putin was aware of the incident, Russian news agencies cited the Kremlin as saying. 
Reuters reporters heard several gunshots during the evening, followed by what sounded like an explosion amid unconfirmed reports that sappers were defusing explosive devices left behind by the gunman. 
Unverified videos shared on social media showed several people resembling police officers holding assault rifles running along a nearby street.
One witness told Reuters he had seen the lifeless body of what he thought was a police officer lying in the street. 
""The shooting began around 17:40,"" one witness told Reuters. ""I saw a member of the traffic police running down the road, hiding behind vehicles."" 

Five ambulances were seen leaving the cordoned-off area.

The French government has pushed for a European security alternative in the Strait of Hormuz after ruling out taking part in a U.S.-led coalition protecting oil tankers and cargo ships from what Washington says is a threat from Iran.
France and others including Germany had feared that joining the U.S. mission would send the wrong message at a time of increased friction between Washington and Tehran. European parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are trying to rescue that accord after the United States pulled out in 2018.
""The Frigate Courbet will take part in the European maritime security initiative from the start of next year,"" said Deputy Armed Forces spokeswoman Brigadier General Anne-Cecile Ortemann.
This year the situation in the Gulf grew more acute as the United States moved more assets there to counter the perceived Iranian threat.
In May and June, several attacks took place on international merchant vessels, including Saudi tankers, in Gulf waters which the United States blamed on Iran. Tehran denies the accusations.
In July, Iranian forces seized a British tanker in the Gulf after British marines captured an Iranian vessel in the Strait of Gibraltar. Both ships were later released.
France has said that about 10 European and non-European countries would join its mission, pending parliamentary approvals. France will use its naval base in the United Arab Emirates as a command center.
So far only the Netherlands and Denmark have confirmed participation. Ortemann said a Dutch frigate and helicopter would begin operating in the area from February. A Danish ship will relieve then in Autumn, a French military official said.
Iran has rejected the European and U.S. moves saying foreign powers should leave securing shipping lanes to Tehran and others in the region. Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude via the Strait of Hormuz.
It is unclear how many nations have joined the U.S. mission, which started in November, although Australia and Britain have committed assets. The British government has shied away from the European-led mission.
Under Washington's plan, the United States will provide coordinating ships and lead surveillance efforts while allies will patrol nearby waters and escort commercial vessels with their nation's flags."

LONDON (Reuters) - Lawyers for Julian Assange said on Thursday they will argue that the WikiLeaks founder cannot be sent from Britain to the United States to face spying charges because a treaty between the two countries bans extradition for political offences.
Assange, 48, faces 18 counts in the U.S. including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. He could spend decades in prison if convicted.
At London's Westminster Magistrates' Court, his lawyer Edward Fitzgerald outlined some of the evidence Assange's team will put forward at the full extradition hearing due to start on Feb. 24, saying they could call up to 21 witnesses to testify.
""We say that there is in the treaty a ban on being extradited for a political offense and these offences as framed and in substance are political offences,"" he told the court.
Other arguments would feature medical evidence, public denunciations by leading U.S. political figures, and details from the case of Chelsea Manning, an ex-intelligence analyst who was convicted by a U.S. Army court-martial in 2013 of espionage and other offences for leaking secret cables to WikiLeaks.
There would also be information from an investigation led by a Spanish judge into ""revelations about bugging of conversations with his lawyers"" during Assange's long stay in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Assange, who appeared by videolink from prison on Thursday, is due to be interviewed by a Spanish judge when he appears in person at the same London court for a private hearing tomorrow over the allegations.
He spent almost seven years holed up in cramped rooms at the embassy where he fled in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was then wanted for questioning over allegations of rape which were later dropped.
He was dragged from the embassy in April and jailed for 50 weeks for skipping bail before the U.S. launched its extradition request. 
Due to the mass of evidence, the full hearing to decide the extradition issue is now set to last for up to four weeks, rather than one as originally planned, Judge Vanessa Baraister said, with Fitzgerald adding it involved ""difficult, important and profound"" matters.
Baraister also seemed unimpressed when Clair Dobbin, representing the U.S. authorities, asked for the case to be delayed until April, saying the lawyer earmarked for the case would not be available for the extended hearing.
""My impression was the (U.S.) government was anxious for this case to remain on track and not to be derailed,"" said Baraister, who said the next hearing would take place on Jan. 23 and the timetable would go ahead as planned.

The 'Ndrangheta is based in the southern region of Calabria, the toe of Italy's boot, and has surpassed Sicily's more famous Cosa Nostra to become the most powerful mafia group in the country -- and one of the largest crime gangs in the world.
Police said they seized hundreds of suspects in early morning swoops around the country, with some arrests also carried out in Germany, Switzerland and Bulgaria.
Amongst the possible charges facing those detained were mafia conspiracy, murder, extortion, loan sharking, corporate fraud and money laundering.
""Politicians were involved, as well as lawyers, accountants, public officials, court clerks. All people who had jobs and did not need to put themselves at the service of the 'Ndrangheta,"" said prosecutor Nicola Gratteri, who led the investigation.
""The mobsters are not in a position to carry out sophisticated money laundering. To do that they need professionals,"" he added.
Gratteri said it was the largest haul of suspected mobsters in Italy since a massive anti-mafia swoop in Sicily in 1984 which led to the so-called Palermo maxi-trial when more than 450 members of Cosa Nostra were tried.
The Palermo trial marked a turning point in the battle against the Sicilian crime gang, and their influence has waned dramatically over the past three decades, allowing 'Ndrangheta to surge to prominence.
Italian investigators say the group, which is made up of dozens of smaller clans that all answer nominally to senior leaders in Calabria, is now Europe's top cocaine broker.
Amongst those arrested on Thursday was a former lawmaker from Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party, the center-left mayor of a Calabrian coastal town and a senior official in the Carabinieri police.
""This has inflicted a very hard blow on the 'Ndrangheta,"" said Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese.
Investigators say that while the 'Ndrangheta is still centered on Calabria, one of the poorest regions in Europe, it has successfully managed to infiltrate the wealthy north.
The head of the Valle D'Aosta region, which borders France and Switzerland, resigned last week after being placed under investigation for alleged vote-rigging linked to 'Ndrangheta at 2018 local elections. He has denied the accusation."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people marched in cities across Sudan on Thursday to celebrate the first anniversary of the start of the uprising that toppled long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir and demand justice for people killed in protests.
Waving national flags and chanting slogans, marchers vowed to continue the political transition that stemmed from the protests that began on Dec. 19 last year in the city of Atbara, and led to the military deposing Bashir on April 11.
""Revolutionaries, revolutionaries! We will complete the journey!"" thousands cheered in Freedom Square (NYSE:SQ), formerly known as Green Square, which protesters took over in the capital Khartoum in July and where Bashir held a big rally in his last months in power.
Others chanted: ""Our martyrs have not died, they live with the revolutionaries!"" 
Repeating a rallying cry for justice for those killed when security forces opened fire to end a sit-in this year near the Defense Ministry headquarters and Bashir's residence, they shouted: ""Blood for blood, we won't accept blood money!"" 
A Sudanese court on Saturday convicted Bashir on corruption charges and sentenced him to two years of detention in a reform facility, the first ruling against the former president.
Some protesters waved posters of Abdalla Hamdok, Sudan's civilian prime minister who heads a technocratic government.
""Hamdok represents me,"" the signs said.
But the authorities now governing under a three-year power-sharing agreement between the military and former opposition and protest groups are under pressure to do more to address economic and political problems, restore the rule of law and protect human rights. 
""On the first anniversary of the revolution, we reaffirm the continuation of [our] covenant with the Sudanese people, and we will not deviate from the demand for freedom, peace and justice,"" the Sudanese Professionals Association, which was the main protest group during the uprising, said on Twitter.
Human rights watchdog Annesty International said it was now ""time to deliver"" on human rights.
""The responsibility on Prime Minister Hamdok’s shoulders is as large as the aspirations of the Sudanese people who suffered decades of serious human rights violations, and crimes under international law including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity,"" said Seif Magango, Amnesty's deputy director for East Africa. 
""The victims have the right to truth, justice and reparations under international law,"" he said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Thursday urged the United States and North Korea to resume dialogue and work to resolve disagreements as soon as possible amid renewed tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over the latter's nuclear and missiles programs.
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui and U.S. special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun met in the Chinese capital on Thursday and exchanged views on achieving denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula in stages, China's foreign ministry said.
It added in a statement that the two sides agreed to continue communication on the matter.
Pyongyang has conducted a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with U.S. President Donald Trump in recent weeks, stoking fears the two countries could return to a collision course. 
Biegun's public call to Pyongyang for renewed dialogue during a visit to South Korea earlier this week went unanswered, underscoring the reclusive state's discontent at a lack of concessions in response to its decision to halt nuclear tests and long-range missile launches. 
China and Russia on Monday introduced a joint proposal that calls on the U.N. Security Council to lift some sanctions on exports and foreign workers to ""break the deadlock"" in the stalled talks between Pyongyang and Washington.
""This is the best plan in the current situation to resolve the stalemate in the denuclearization of North Korea and for its peace and stability,"" Luo told reporters at a separate briefing earlier on Thursday, adding that a political solution is still achievable despite a recent rise in tensions. 
The U.S. holds veto power in the 15-member council and remains opposed to any sanctions relief, however, making the China-Russia resolution unlikely to go through.
Biegun did not speak to reporters as he entered a Beijing hotel late on Thursday. It was unclear whether he would hold any further meetings on Friday. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Trump met for the first time in Singapore in June 2018 and have met twice more since, but scant progress toward denuclearization has been made and Kim has given Trump until the end of this year to show flexibility.
North Korea's U.N. envoy declared this month that denuclearization was off the table, and some analysts say Pyongyang could soon conduct a test for a major strategic weapon such as an intercontinental ballistic missile. 

""We hope that the concerned parties will practice restraint and meet each other halfway, and work through dialogue to realize positive interactions and quickly find a meeting point to find a resolution,"" Luo told reporters at the briefing.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The Pakistan government said on Thursday it was seeking to disbar the leader of a three-judge panel which ruled that the corpse of ex-military ruler Pervez Musharraf should hang for three days if the general dies before his execution.
The special court sentenced Musharraf, 76, to death on Tuesday after finding him guilty of high treason for subverting the constitution in 2007. He took power in a 1999 coup.
The court directed law enforcers to apprehend Musharraf, currently receiving medical treatment in Dubai, to ensure the death sentence is carried out.
But if found dead beforehand, ""his corpse (should) be dragged to D-Chowk, Islamabad, Pakistan, and be hanged for three days"", it said.
The chowk, or square, is just outside parliament.
Thursday's bizarre announcement came after the government said it had found ""gaps and weaknesses"" in the original sentence, apparently taking sides in a split between the military and the judiciary, and the general's lawyers said Musharraf planned to appeal.
Legal experts termed the instructions unconstitutional, even if symbolic.
Law Minister Farogh Naseem said the government was seeking to remove the leader of the three-judge panel. The judge, Waqar Ahmad Seth, had violated judicial conduct, he said.
""Our plea is that such a judge has got no authority to be a judge of any high court or the supreme court,"" he said. ""He is unfit.""
Escalating the tension with the judiciary, the army spokesman said the court announcement proved his assertion that the original sentence was flawed.
""Today's decision, particularly the wording used in it, is beyond humanity, religion, civilization or any values,"" he told a news conference.
He said army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had taken up the issue with Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
The original sentence had already shocked the military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half the country's history. The army accused the court of ignoring legal processes and defended Musharraf's patriotism.
Attorney General Anwar Mansoor Khan has said Musharraf wasn't given a fair trial, taking the army line.
Tensions between the military and the judiciary rose after the Supreme Court struck down a three-year extension of service given by the government to army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.
Musharraf, who was tried and sentenced in absentia, said in Dubai the charges against him were politically motivated.
Musharraf seized power in a coup in 1999 and later ruled as president.
In November 2007, Musharraf suspended the constitution and imposed emergency rule, prompting protests. He resigned in 2008 to avoid the threat of impeachment.
When Nawaz Sharif, whom Musharraf deposed in 1999, was re-elected prime minister in 2013, he initiated a treason trial against Musharraf and in 2014 he was charged with high treason.
""This case was taken up only due to a personal vendetta by some people against me,"" Musharraf said in a video statement from his hospital bed in Dubai.

Musharraf traveled to Dubai after a travel ban was lifted in 2016 and he has refused to appear before the court, despite multiple orders.

The local deal coincided with renewed diplomatic efforts by the United Nations this week and as Saudi Arabia carries out informal talks with the Houthis about a possible ceasefire. 
Seventy-five detainees affiliated with the internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi were released, local government sources said. In exchange, 60 people affiliated with the Houthi group were also released, according to Houthi-run al-Masirah TV and the local sources.
Yemen has been mired in almost five years of conflict since the Houthi movement ousted Hadi's government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014, prompting intervention in 2015 by a Saudi-led military coalition in a bid to restore his government. 
Yemen's third city of Taiz is a volatile front line. A U.N.-mediated deal reached in Stockholm last December aimed to set up a committee to establish humanitarian corridors to the city, but no progress has been made so far. 
The United Nations has been trying to re-launch political negotiations to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine. 
A year on from Stockholm, U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths visited officials in Yemen and Riyadh this week. 
U.N.-mediated talks between warring parties in the strategic port city of Hodeidah also took place for the first time since September. The United Nations has sought to implement a local truce and troop withdrawal from the port agreed at Stockholm. 

Meanwhile, Riyadh has been holding informal talks with the Houthis since late September about a wider ceasefire, sources familiar with the discussions have said, as it seeks to exit an unpopular war after its main coalition partner the United Arab Emirates withdrew troops earlier this year.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Former minister Hassan Diab looked set to be named Lebanon's new prime minister on Thursday with backing from the Iran-backed group Hezbollah and its allies, a move that could complicate efforts to secure badly needed Western financial aid.
The nomination, expected later in the day, sets the stage for the formation of a cabinet that excludes allies of the United States and Sunni Gulf Arab countries while underlining the influence of Iran's friends in Lebanon.
Diab, a little-known academic with a doctorate in computer engineering, has not commented publicly since his name surfaced overnight.
Lebanon, wrestling with the worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war, has been in dire need of a new government since outgoing Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri resigned on Oct. 29, prompted by protests against the ruling elite.
But efforts to reach a deal on a new premier have been mired in divisions that reflect long-standing tensions between Hariri, who is aligned with Western and Gulf Arab states, and the heavily armed Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah. Washington regards Hezbollah as a terrorist group and has imposed sanctions on it.
President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally who has also been at political loggerheads with Hariri, began consultations on Thursday with deputies to designate the new premier, who under the country's sectarian political system must be a Sunni Muslim.
Aoun, a Maronite Christian, is required to designate the candidate with the most support. 
The move to nominate Diab signaled a decision by Hezbollah and its allies to abandon efforts to forge a consensus with Hariri and to install a candidate of their choosing, drawing on the parliamentary majority they secured in a 2018 election.
But it was not immediately clear how quickly a government would be formed. Until that happens, Hariri, Lebanon's leading Sunni politician, will stay on as caretaker prime minister.
CRISIS
Lebanon is facing an unprecedented financial crisis: banks are imposing tight capital controls, the Lebanese pound has slumped by a third from its official rate and companies are shedding jobs and slashing salaries.
Fitch last week cut Lebanon's credit rating for the third time in a year, warning it now expected the country to restructure or default on its debt.
Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said: ""A government with a Hezbollah-backed prime minister would be even less likely to secure support from the Gulf countries...and might also potentially reduce the chances of Lebanon getting support from the IMF if the U.S. raises concerns."" 
A senior banker said time is running out and that politicians do not grasp the scale of the crisis. He expressed concern Hezbollah is too preoccupied with its struggle with the United States. ""Right now the real battle is how to solve this real crisis - liquidity meltdown,"" the banker said. 
Hariri did not put forward anyone for the post of prime minister and MPs with his Future Movement told Aoun it would not take part in the next government, a source close to Hariri said. 
Hariri had seemed on course to be nominated prime minister himself but withdrew his candidacy on Wednesday.
That decision followed a move by the Christian Lebanese Forces, a staunchly anti-Hezbollah party with close Gulf ties, to nominate neither Hariri nor anyone else for the position.
Diab served as education minister in a government led by ex-premier Najib Mikati, and is currently Vice President at the American University of Beirut.

The judge, Waqar Ahmad Seth, had violated judicial conduct by issuing the bizarre order that Musharraf's body should hang in public if he dies before his execution.
The federal government had decided to approach the Supreme Judicial council. ""Our plea is that such a judge has got no authority to be a judge of any high court or the supreme court,"" he said. ""He is unfit.""
The court sentenced Musharraf to death on Tuesday after finding him guilty of high treason for subverting the constitution in 2007."

The peaceful protest of about 100 people had been held outside the presidential palace and military headquarters on Aug. 28 and followed a period of unrest in Papua.
Prosecutor P. Permana read out the indictment in the Central Jakarta court saying the six defendants had organized a rally demanding the Indonesian government allow a vote in Papua to let it separate from Indonesia
One of the six waved the ""Morning Star"" flag, while dancing and singing, the indictment said. The flag is a banned symbol of Papuan nationhood.
""The action by the defendants is treason with the aim to separate Papua province and West Papua province from the unitary state of Indonesia,"" said Permana. 
There was a small protest outside the court on Thursday held by pro-Papuan activists calling for the release of the six.
The six could face up to 20 years in jail if found guilty.
A hearing for the defense is due on Jan. 2, but the six have said it was their constitutional right to participate in the rally.

Resource-rich Papua was a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a controversial U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. The region has since endured decades of mostly low-level separatist conflict.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called for the closing of migrant detention camps in Libya on Thursday, saying they were rife with torture and slavery.
Francis, who has made defense of migrants and refugees a key part of his pontificate, made his comments in to a group of refugees, including women and children, brought to Italy by the Vatican from a transit camp on the Greek island of Lesbos.
""How can we fail to hear the cry of so many brothers and sisters who prefer to face a tempestuous sea rather than die slowly in Libyan detention camps, places of torture and ignoble slavery?"" he said.
More than 5,000 refugees and migrants are held in 19 official detention facilities in Libya, some controlled by armed groups, as well as an unknown number in squalid centres run by traffickers, according to the United Nations. 
Rights groups say abuses are rife including beating and forced labor.
""We need a serious commitment to empty out the detention camps in Libya, evaluating and activating all possible solutions,"" Francis said, adding, without elaborating, that ""complicity by institutions"" should be denounced. 
In September, prosecutors arrested three people, a Guinean and two Egyptians, suspected of torturing migrants in a detention center in northwest Libya. The three were found in a migrant registration center in Sicily.
Francis spoke sombrely as he unveiled a cross bearing a battered red life jacket that was used by an unknown migrant who drowned in the Mediterranean in July.
Detainees in the Libyan camps include those who left on boats for Europe and were brought back by the European Union- backed Libyan Coast Guard, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
More than 1,100 migrants have died or are missing at sea after attempting to cross the Mediterranean this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. The number of crossings dropped sharply from 2017 amid an EU backed push to block arrivals.

""The problem is not resolved by blocking boats,"" Francis said, adding that this left them at the mercy of unscrupulous human traffickers.

More than 450 people, mostly unarmed demonstrators but also some members of the security forces, have been killed since a wave of popular unrest began on Oct. 1. Protesters, most of them young, are demanding an overhaul of a political system they see as profoundly corrupt and keeping most Iraqis in poverty.
The protests have shaken the country out of two years of relative calm following the defeat of Islamic State insurgents.
Infighting between political parties who are clinging onto power has fueled the crisis and threatens to cause more unrest as protesters lose patience.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned last month under pressure from the streets but has remained in office in a caretaker capacity. The constitutional deadline to name a replacement expires on Thursday.
""Until this moment no candidate has been agreed on by the political parties. We have multiple nominees but their partisan affiliations prevent them from having the job,"" said Shi'ite Muslim lawmaker Naeem al-Abboudi.
Two blocs of political parties, one backed by Iran and the other populist and anti-Iranian, are closely involved in backroom deals to agree on a candidate before Salih presents them.
President Barham Salih this week asked the largest bloc in parliament to nominate a new premier to form a government. The two main blocs dispute who has the most seats because this was never made clear in the current parliament, and some lawmakers have frequently switched allegiance.
“Differences are everywhere and it will not be easy to agree soon on a new election law inside parliament,” said Hassan Khalati, another Shi’ite lawmaker.
Lawmakers and politicians said Salih could now delay the nomination to Dec. 22, based on a federal court ruling allowing national holidays to be excluded from the run-up to the constitutional deadline.
That would create breathing space for the political factions to strike a deal, with Abdul Mahdi remaining as caretaker premier until then, legal expert Tareq Harb said.
But any agreement on thorny political issues looks unlikely.
The house failed on Wednesday to pass a new electoral law, a key demand of protesters, which would make elections fairer after each round in recent years has been marred by allegations of fraud.
Protesters demand a new electoral law and committee, but also the removal of the entire political class, and a prime minister with no party affiliation."
249,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 07:36AM ET</span>",Special Report: Why big business can count on courts to keep its deadly secrets,"By Michelle Conlin, Dan Levine and Lisa Girion
NEWARK, New Jersey (Reuters) - In the dreary archives of a Newark, New Jersey, courthouse, Ronald Motley found a treasure map.
It was an evidence log, a detailed inventory of documents and other exhibits that had been used in an injured worker’s lawsuit. And it was freely available to anyone who bothered to look for it – for this was long ago in 1978, before the routine use of protective orders, sealed documents and other tools of concealment wrapped U.S. courts in lethal secrecy.
Motley, a lanky, deep-drawling South Carolina lawyer, had been representing sick workers in lawsuits against companies that used asbestos. And he was losing, as defense lawyers convinced juries that the companies had only recently learned of the dangers of the cancer-causing mineral. Now, the log might guide him to proof that the companies had long known that asbestos exposure could be deadly.
The proof came in a carton of documents that had belonged to Sumner Simpson, once president of manufacturer Raybestos-Manhattan Inc. The documents exposed a conspiracy of suppression and silence among multiple companies even as workers sickened and died. “I think the less said about asbestos,” Simpson wrote in a 1935 letter to a lawyer at another company, “the better off we are.”
Motley shared the documents with other plaintiff lawyers and with Los Angeles Times reporter Henry Weinstein, who was with Motley in Newark that day in 1978 and recounted the lawyer’s discovery to Reuters. A member of Congress got them, too. In a matter of months, the Sumner Simpson papers unlocked what one prominent plaintiff lawyer had dubbed a new “industrial Watergate.” Congress held hearings, workplace safety rules were enacted, workers won more lawsuits, and scores of companies, including Raybestos, declared bankruptcy. The companies set up victim trust funds that have paid out more than $30 billion in settlements and that continue compensating victims even now.
Today, there’s little chance a lawyer – or a journalist or a concerned citizen – could do what Motley did. That’s because in the intervening decades, big business and its legal lieutenants succeeded in a focused, concerted campaign that has ensured that secrecy cloaks lawsuits alleging that their products can kill or injure people.
“The federal judiciary’s commitment to open justice has come under sustained attack by corporate lawyers and lobbyists,” said Representative Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat and member of the House Judiciary Committee. “Corporations are allowed to hide evidence that they sacrificed their customers’ health and safety in the name of corporate efficiencies.”
The asbestos settlements – the biggest mass tort in U.S. history by number of claims – ushered in a wave of product-liability litigation. Suddenly, corporate America had a new problem: myriad demands from plaintiff lawyers for internal records that could expose executives to broad scrutiny for what they knew and failed to do about potential threats their products posed to public health and safety.
A CLOSED SYSTEM
In response, the corporate defense bar and its allies transformed the taxpayer-funded courts into a much more closed system, according to a Reuters review of hundreds of judicial policy documents and court filings and dozens of interviews. The corporate lawyers found ready support from judges and court staff overwhelmed by all the litigation and the paperwork it produced.
Over the years, they threw a blanket of confidentiality over discovery, the pretrial exchange of information between opposing sides. They turned protective orders into pro forma exercises to muzzle lawyers who might otherwise share pertinent information with regulators or the public. And they succeeded in getting judges to routinely seal court filings, thus ensuring that when lawsuits are settled before trial, as usually happens in product-liability cases, the evidence remains hidden.
The toll is high. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed or seriously injured by allegedly harmful products after judges in recent years allowed litigants to file under seal, beyond public view, evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to the dangers. The secrecy allowed drug makers to market painkillers as safe while the body count from the opioid-related epidemic mounted; auto makers to sell cars with lethally weak roofs that killed people in rollovers though tests had years earlier revealed the risk; gun maker Remington to knowingly sell rifles with bum triggers that killed scores of people.
Had today’s secrecy-friendly court rules been in place 40 years ago, the evidence log Motley found in Newark wouldn’t have been filed publicly. Even if he had found the Sumner Simpson papers by other means, he almost certainly couldn’t have shared them as he did. And had he filed them in court to support his case, Raybestos would very likely have requested – and been granted – a court seal.
The forces of secrecy wore down the longstanding norm of openness in the judicial system by exploiting a pivotal Supreme Court decision and lobbying Congress and the obscure but powerful panel that sets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
They argued that U.S. businesses had a right to privacy similar to what individuals enjoy, and that limiting that right threatened the foundations of American free enterprise. They said it was the courts’ responsibility to protect companies from the unfair and damaging publicity that can arise from unproven allegations that their products are dangerous. As a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co lawyer told Congress in 1994, such allegations cause ""substantial harm"" not only to defendants, but also to the public because they are misleading.
Among the most forceful fighters for secrecy was lobbyist Al Cortese. Companies defending against lawsuits need protective and sealing orders to contain costs, prevent negative publicity and safeguard trade secrets and intellectual property, Cortese said in an interview. Now retired, Cortese remains a true believer in the cause: Company files are not public information, even when they are a part of a public court case, he said. “It’s private information, and therefore there is a right to protect that information in litigation … It’s a fundamental principle.”
As Reuters revealed earlier in this series, judges sealed evidence relevant to public health and safety in dozens of the biggest defective-product cases consolidated in federal court over the past 20 years. Those cases comprised nearly 250,000 individual death and injury lawsuits, involving drugs, cars, medical devices and other products used by millions of consumers. Broadly worded protective orders gave the parties the power to mark almost any document as confidential in 45 of the cases.
After Reuters published its first report on court secrecy, U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said at a hearing on transparency in the courts that he planned to reintroduce the Sunshine in Litigation Act. Prior versions of the bill would have allowed litigants to share evidence related to public health and safety with regulators, regardless of protective orders. Those earlier bills, introduced regularly over the past 30 years, stalled amid opposition from business groups that argued the legislation would increase the costs and burdens of civil litigation.
Judge Richard Story, speaking for the federal judiciary at the September hearing, did not dispute Reuters’ findings. He acknowledged that judges sometimes fail to scrutinize sealed documents, as required, to determine whether secrecy is justified. “That can happen,” he said. “I will be honest with you.”
TRADITION OF TRANSPARENCY
When plaintiff lawyers like Ron Motley started suing the asbestos industry on behalf of dying workers in the 1970s, the federal courts were radically different. They operated under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as drafted in the 1930s by a committee of lawyers and law school professors. They imbued the rules with the tradition of open trials that had evolved over centuries of Anglo-American common law.
The rules on public access to the courts also reflected the progressive politics of the era, said Stephen Burbank, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. Progressives believed that transparency was essential for public institutions to govern effectively and that secrecy impaired the public’s ability to gauge whether the courts decided cases fairly, Burbank said.
“The spirit of the times calls for disclosure, not concealment, in every field,” law professor Edson Sunderland, one of the drafters of the rules, wrote in 1925.
When the original rules took effect in 1938, they required litigants to file key forms of pretrial discovery in court. This included witness depositions, which are interviews conducted under oath, and written answers and documents produced in response to requests for information from opposing parties.
It was because of these rules that a New Jersey plaintiff lawyer publicly filed the evidence log Motley later found in Newark. Motley then went back to court and filed a motion that compelled Raybestos to turn over the Sumner Simpson papers.
To address conflicts between the public interest in transparency and privacy rights, the rules allowed for protective orders. Originally, the rules allowed judges to decide on a case-by-case basis what deposition subjects could be shielded from scrutiny. The rules were refined in 1970 to specify that protective orders cover anything that could be a source of “annoyance, embarrassment, oppression,” including trade secrets, such as the formula for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).
By the late 1970s, some defendants sought protective orders, but the tactic was far from routine. A few courts had even begun to invalidate them, ruling that they ran afoul of the constitutional right to free speech by gagging plaintiffs and their lawyers from disclosing evidence of alleged malfeasance.
Because no protective order stopped Motley from quickly making the Sumner Simpson papers public, the documents had immediate impact beyond the courtroom. At the time, the asbestos industry was lobbying in Congress for a bill that would have mandated that the government pay some workers’ claims, essentially foisting the cost on taxpayers. The evidence that companies knew of the health risks for decades undercut their efforts, and the bill never advanced, said John Lawrence, former top staffer for then-Congressman George Miller. Within months of Motley’s discovery, the California Democrat featured the Sumner Simpson papers in hearings.
HIGH COURT EFFECT
Six years after Motley’s discovery, an unexpected Supreme Court decision ended the legal debate over protective orders and handed the defense bar a new weapon to beat back a rising wave of product-liability cases.
The case, Seattle Times v Rhinehart, had nothing to do with defective products. An obscure religious group called the Aquarian Foundation had obtained a protective order to keep its membership rolls secret during discovery in a lawsuit it had filed against the Seattle Times. The newspaper appealed to the high court, and the case caught Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr’s attention.
Decades of work as a corporate defense lawyer had made Powell a rich man by the time President Richard Nixon named him to the high court in 1971. His clients had included the tobacco industry, and he had served as a director of cigarette maker Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), grappling at the time with the release of research showing that tobacco causes cancer.
Two months before his nomination, Powell’s passionately pro-business views informed a secret memo he wrote for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, titled “Attack on American Free Enterprise.” In it, he warned that American capitalism was under attack not just from “the Communists” and “New Leftists,” but also “perfectly respectable elements of society,” including “the college campus, the pulpit, the media, the intellectual,” as well as consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
Powell urged the Chamber to build a roster of “attractive” speakers, scholars and media handlers to defend “our side.” Civil rights, labor and consumer rights groups were winning cases “often at business’ expense,” Powell wrote. “Other organizations and groups, recognizing this, have been far more astute in exploiting judicial action than American business.”
On the bench, Powell had been voicing concern about the growing burden of discovery on the U.S. legal system – particularly in complex cases – when Seattle Times v Rhinehart came before the court in 1983. As Powell read the clerk’s memo briefing the justices on the case, he saw the clerk had characterized all information received by a litigant in discovery as “protected in some way” under the First Amendment’s guarantees of free speech and thus more difficult to shield from the public. Powell marked that sentence with a question mark, according to the justice’s notes, housed at the Washington and Lee University Law School.
He and four colleagues voted to hear the case. A few days after oral arguments, eight of the nine justices voted to uphold a judge’s order blocking the discovery documents from public disclosure. The original discovery order was “extremely broad,” compelling the Aquarian Foundation to disclose its membership and sources of financial support, the justices ruled. Powell was assigned to write the opinion.
Over the next three months, the justices debated how broadly the court should interpret the constitutionality of protective orders.
At one point, Justice William Brennan, one of the court’s liberal leaders, asked Powell to remove language from his draft opinion that flatly stated that pretrial depositions “are not public components of a civil trial.”
Powell refused – and that single line of prose became part of the legal foundation for every protective order that followed.
Powell’s language allowed the corporate defense bar to institutionalize protective orders in litigation across the country – shutting the public out of pretrial investigations as a matter of routine, even when the concealed discovery material could alert the public and regulators to potential danger.
And protective orders have become an excuse for secrecy beyond discovery. Litigants routinely cite protective orders themselves as an argument for filing evidence in court under seal, thus ensuring that secrecy endures for the life of a case.
Judges rarely object when litigants file evidence under seal. In 115 of the biggest mass torts over the past 20 years, judges sealed public health and safety information in about half of them. Most of the time, they failed to explain, as they are required to do, how the need for secrecy outweighed the public interest in transparency.
Nader said that during his 1960s investigation into safety issues around the Chevrolet Corvair sportscar – the work that made him famous – some of the best evidence came from depositions filed in court or obtained directly from lawyers suing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), material that today would typically be hidden behind a protective order.
“I’d call the lawyers and say I want the information. They’d say ‘Sure you can have it. Just pay copy costs and we’ll give it to you.’ ” The protective order that has since then become the norm, he said, “is an abuse of the judicial process. It limits the case for the plaintiff, tilts the case in favor of the defense and deprives the public of potential life-saving information … It’s censorship by another name.”
THE IDEAL CANDIDATE
A year after the Supreme Court’s 1984 ruling in support of protective orders, a judge overseeing a wrongful death lawsuit against  Ford Motor Co  observed that the courts were being “bombarded by an ever increasing number of requests” for them.
The defense bar’s leading trade group, the Defense Research Institute, published a 1987 guide citing the Supreme Court’s decision and urging corporate litigators to seek protective orders “even where defense counsel can make no special claim of confidentiality.”
In a statement emailed to Reuters, DRI said it supports “the legal right of clients to seek protective orders when circumstances dictate.”
The drive to limit transparency wasn’t without pushback. Newspapers published investigations about the harms of court secrecy in individual cases in the late 1980s, and some elected officials, supported by the plaintiffs’ bar, began to resist. They devised what corporate lawyers called “the perennial Kohl bill,” which Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, introduced in the Senate for several years starting in the early 1990s. This proposed legislation – the precursor to the Sunshine in Litigation Act that Representative Nadler has pledged to reintroduce – sought to limit protective orders in cases that raise broader concerns about public health and safety.
At the same time, big companies were facing a litigation crisis in the states. Judges and juries in what plaintiff lawyers called “magic jurisdictions” that tended to favor consumers – in states like Texas, Mississippi, West Virginia and Illinois – were giving rise to “runaway verdicts,” recalled Tom Gottschalk, a onetime partner and now of counsel at Washington, D.C., law firm Kirkland & Ellis who served as general counsel of General Motors Co from 1994 to 2006.
Corporations needed an advocate. Gottschalk and others had the ideal candidate.
Al Cortese grew up in a working-class South Philadelphia neighborhood and earned a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1962. He made his name defending corporations in price-fixing cases, transforming himself into an impeccably tailored oenophile whose elegant appearance belied his attack-dog style in court.
Gottschalk had hired Cortese in 1984 to work on tort reform and other legislative issues. And by the 1990s, Cortese was leading what he called a “defense bar coalition” to influence state and federal policy makers to protect corporate privacy in product-liability litigation.
'LET ME GET VERY BASIC'
To Cortese – and the defense bar he represented – the idea that courts were hiding fatal secrets in their files was “nonsense.” Rather, Cortese viewed the drive for more transparency in the courts as a publicity ploy by plaintiff lawyers and the media. Public regulators, Cortese argued, had ample power to seek information needed to protect the public.
In an interview at his vineyard in Solvang, California, Cortese, now 82, segued easily into the aggressive style for which he is known as he explained the ideas behind his advocacy. At first, he laughed. “Let me get very basic,” he said. “What is the public right to observe the legal system? What is it?”
Cortese smacked the table on his poolside patio to underscore his point: “The right of the public to observe the court system means that they have a right to show up in court when there is a public trial. That is the extent of the public’s right to observe … Discovery and other information in court files – that is private information, and the right of privacy protects the information constitutionally.”
Told that this wasn’t what U.S. appeals courts say, Cortese grew angry. “Yes it is!” he shouted. “Because you are focusing on, ‘In every case (judges) have to make this 123456 analysis.’ No. They. Don’t.”
In his September testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, however, Judge Story made clear that documents filed in court are presumed to be public and that judges are obliged to justify secrecy. “Only the most compelling reasons justify the nondisclosure of court records,” Story said. “A judge that grants a request to seal court records must set forth specific findings and conclusions that justify nondisclosure to the public — even if there is no objection to the motion to seal.”
As head of the defense bar lobbying team, Cortese set about batting back sunshine-in-litigation movements in the states, as well as furnishing the judges who presided over the federal civil rules advisory committee with academic opinions from top scholars who were friendly to the defense bar’s case.
Most important were the writings of Arthur Miller, a professor then at Harvard Law School and one of the most widely respected U.S. legal experts. He became a darling of the secrecy set with a seminal 1991 law review article in which he argued that critics of court secrecy relied merely on anecdote. There was no data, he wrote, to prove that secrecy caused widespread harm. After their first meeting, Cortese sealed his friendship with Miller by sending him a case of mixed Barolo.
Armed with the arguments of intellectuals like Miller, Cortese set his sights on Senator Kohl’s latest attempt to get his sunshine bill passed.
In a 1994 Senate hearing, Kohl argued passionately for transparency. “Because the courts are public institutions funded by hundreds of millions of tax dollars, and because justice is a public good, our court system must also do its part to help protect the public when appropriate,” he said. “Far too often, however, the court system allows vital information that is discovered in litigation – and which directly bears on public health and safety – to be covered up, to be shielded from mothers, fathers, and children whose lives are potentially at stake, and from the officials we have appointed to watch over our health and safety.”
While debating Kohl’s bill, Congress sought the expertise of Judge Patrick Higginbotham, then chairman of the Federal Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure. Cortese said he got to know him, too. Higginbotham made many of the same arguments advanced by Cortese and Miller: Judges should be left to monitor protective orders themselves. Kohl’s bill would multiply discovery disputes in mass torts and would eat up too much of judges’ time. Republican Charles Grassley from Iowa repeated the same talking points while arguing against the bill on the Senate floor.
Higginbotham said neither Cortese nor anyone else had undue influence on his views. Grassley declined to comment. His office noted that the senator voted for versions of Kohl’s bill in 2008 and 2011 that contained language to guard against “frivolous litigation.”
Kohl’s bill failed by two votes. It has been introduced in every Congress since, and has failed each time.
INTO THE SIDE ROOMS
Beyond the courts and Congress, Cortese and the cadre of secrecy proponents focused their efforts on the federal court rules committee.
In the late 1990s, the committee held a series of meetings to address the rules on what types of discovery material must be filed publicly – like the evidence log Motley found in New Jersey. Judges and court clerks had been complaining for years about the voluminous paperwork produced in discovery, particularly in mass torts. Clerks struggled to store and manage documents that could amount to millions of pages in a single case.
At first, the judges and lawyers on the committee were cautious. They remembered the backlash that 20 years earlier had sunk a proposal to bar deposition transcripts and other discovery documents from the courthouse. Back then, the New York Times editorial page and politicians like Senator Edward Kennedy had decried the so-called “Green Tree Rule” because they feared it would undermine transparency in the courts.
This time, facing scant opposition, the committee got tough, changing an early draft proposal that discovery material “need not” be filed to say it “must not.”
When the committee gathered in Gleneden, Oregon, to vote on the rule, the room was stocked with lawyers and lobbyists representing companies facing product-liability lawsuits. Among them was Cortese, who had become a fixture at the meetings, testifying and advocating on issues dear to the defense bar.
The rules committee voted in favor of the change, and no members of Congress pushed back. Without fanfare or controversy, the amended “Rule 5d” took effect in 2000. Discovery was now closed off from the public for good.
While some transparency proponents had pushed back on the proposed rule during the public comment period, no one from consumer advocacy groups, First Amendment organizations or media companies showed up for the committee’s vote, according to minutes of the discussion.
The impediment was resources, Nader said. Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group he founded in 1971, filed testimony opposing the rule change, he said, but consumer groups were outgunned by their opponents, backed by corporations that could pay an army of expensive lawyers. “They wear you down,” he said. “There will be ten hearings, and all you can go to is two, if you can pay to travel.”
PAST AND FUTURE
By the time he died in 2013 at age 68, Ron Motley was one of the most prominent plaintiff lawyers in the United States, renowned for his courtroom theatrics and lavish lifestyle. In addition to securing settlements for more than 100,000 asbestos victims, he also belonged to the team of lawyers that battled Big Tobacco, resulting in a record $246 billion settlement, and later represented victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
One of the first things he did with the Sumner Simpson papers was to persuade a South Carolina judge to reopen the case of asbestos insulator Gordon Luther Barnett, who had died in his 60s from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the tissue surrounding the lungs and other organs that is caused by asbestos exposure.
In his decision to grant a new trial – the case was eventually settled – the judge cited the Sumner Simpson papers. The documents Motley found, he said, exposed “a conscious effort by the industry in the 1930s to downplay, or arguably suppress, the dissemination of information to employees and the public for fear of the promotion of lawsuits.”
His words, describing the tactics of businesses in decades past, were prescient of what was to play out time and again in the years ahead as secrecy enveloped the courts.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 07:32AM ET</span>","Algeria swears in new president, protest movement debates response","By Lamine Chikhi
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria swore in Abdelmadjid Tebboune as president on Thursday as the Hirak protest movement debated its response to his offer of dialogue to end a months-long political crisis. 
Hirak has mobilized huge street protests since February demanding a full clear-out of a shadowy, long entrenched ruling elite that it sees as corrupt and undemocratic, and the army’s withdrawal from politics.
Mounted guards in traditional red tunics, white turbans and hooded cloaks lined the way into the Palais des Nations as Tebboune entered, Algeria's flag fluttering overhead. 
Tebboune, a former prime minister who casts himself as a reformer, was elected last week in a vote the opposition regarded as a charade intended to keep the elite in power.
After taking the oath he said in a speech that consultations on a new constitution that he promised last week would start soon, and that it would limit presidents to two terms of office. He pledged to fight corruption and diversify the economy. 
After his speech Tebboune embraced army chief Ahmed Gaed Salah, whom protesters have demanded step down, and awarded him a medal of merit. 
The army saw the Dec. 12 vote as the best way to end 10 months of weekly mass protests that helped oust ex-president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April after two decades in power, and restore a political order in which it holds sway.
Official figures showed an election turnout of 40% as protests and strikes paralyzed some cities and towns in Algeria, a major oil and gas exporter, with Tebboune winning 58% of votes.
State media presented even that low level of turnout as a victory, though with no outside observers monitoring the vote, many Hirak supporters regarded the figures as suspect. 
""Tebboune is not my president. He doesn't represent Hirak and has no legitimacy. Protests must go on until the people become the decision-makers,"" said Slimane Hachoud, 24, who has been protesting since February. 
Since the election, the weekly Friday and Tuesday protests have gone ahead as usual, though there were widespread reports of police arresting many demonstrators in the western city of Oran.
Within the leaderless protest movement, where debate over goals and strategy takes place on social media or during demonstrations, there were mixed reactions to the offer of dialogue and a new constitution that Tebboune made last week. 
""We are not against dialogue and negotiations to end the crisis, but we cannot shake Tebboune's hand if he doesn't first free the detainees,"" said Abdeljabar, a student protester. 
Scores of protesters and opposition figures have been detained or jailed since the start of the protests in February on charges including ""undermining national unity"" and ""weakening army morale"". 
However, some prominent Hirak supporters urged talks. 
""Now that the generals have a civilian representative in the person of Abdelmadjid Tebboune, we must negotiate the transition to a rule of law with him,"" said Lahouari Addi, a political science professor. 
""Hirak must initiate and offer names with a list of demands,"" Lies Merabet, a labor union leader, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

251,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 07:27AM ET</span>",Putin says he's open to tweaking presidential term limits,"By Vladimir Soldatkin
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he was open to the possibility of altering Russia's constitution, including proposals to increase parliament's power and to limit the number of presidential terms anyone can serve. 
The issue of constitutional change in Russia is watched closely amid speculation about Putin's own political ambitions. 
In power as either president or prime minister since 1999, Putin, 67, is due to step down in 2024 when his fourth presidential term ends. Under the current constitution, which bans anyone from serving more than two successive presidential terms, Putin is barred from immediately running again. 
Critics have accused him of plotting to wield power beyond 2024 however, suggesting he might change the constitution to run again as president, shift power to parliament and assume an enhanced role as prime minister, or head a new union state comprised of Russia and neighboring Belarus.
Putin on Thursday said he was open to the idea of making constitutional changes when it came to parliamentary powers and the institutions of the presidency and prime minister, but said Russia should tread carefully. 
""It's only possible to do this (changes) after thorough preparation and a deep discussion in society. You'd need to be very careful,"" Putin said at his annual news conference.
He said he was open to tweaking presidential term limits, suggesting they could be changed to limit anyone's ability to serve more than two terms, something he has done. 
“One thing that could be changed about these (presidential) terms is removing the clause about 'successive' (terms). Your humble servant served two terms consecutively, then left his post and had the constitutional right to return to the post of president, because these were not two successive terms,"" he said.

""(This clause) troubles some of our political analysts and public figures. Well, maybe it could be removed.""

ON IMPEACHMENT OF U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
""You phrase your question as if Trump's presidency is coming to an end. I am not sure that's the case. (The impeachment bill) still needs to go through the Senate where Republicans as far as I know have a majority. It's unlikely they will want to remove from power a representative of their party based on what are, in my opinion, completely fabricated reasons.""
ON EXTENDING THE NEW START ARMS CONTROL TREATY 
""We are ready until the end of the year to extend the existing agreement, the new START treaty.""
""Now if we were to receive a letter tomorrow – we are ready to sign it and send it back to Washington.""
""But thus far there has been no answer to any of our suggestions. And without a new START treaty, there is nothing to curb an arms race. And that, in my opinion, is bad.""
ON PROGRESS OF RUSSIA'S NATIONAL PROJECTS
""I believe that there is no need to revise anything in principle. Individual responsibility (for the projects' progress) has been introduced, it could be strengthened."" 
""Out of the 38 goals that were set for this year, we consider 26 to have been achieved.""
ON RUSSIA'S DOPING SCANDAL
""Any punishment should be individual. If someone is guilty of something specific, then that is completely natural and just.""
""If WADA does not have any claims against our national Olympic Committee, then our team should be allowed to participate under its own flag. Deal with specific people.""
""We are doing everything to make sure Russian sport is clean.""
UKRAINE PEACE TALKS
""There is nothing other than the Minsk (peace) Agreements. I was of course concerned by (Ukrainian President) Zelenskiy's statement... that they could be revised. If a revision of the Minsk Agreements starts, then the situation could enter a complete dead end.""
""Direct dialogue on Donbass is needed. It is lacking.""
UKRAINE GAS TALKS
""This is a very difficult, sensitive topic. We would like to solve this problem.""
""We will look for a solution that is acceptable for all parties, including Ukraine. That's despite the construction of infrastructure such as Nord Stream-1, Nord Stream-2, Turk Stream. We will preserve gas transit through Ukraine."" 

""We have no desire to exacerbate the situation in the energy sector or use this to influence the situation in Ukraine itself.""

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - A Chinese labor activist and his assistant who ran a social media account helping sanitation workers in the southern city of Guangzhou have been arrested, friends said on Thursday.
Chen Wenxiang ran a blog called ""Heart Sanitation"" which provided advice to workers on how to deal with unfair contracts and gain public attention for their working conditions by using social media platforms.
Chen and his assistant were arrested and taken from Chen's home by more than a dozen uniformed and plainclothed police on Tuesday, a fellow activist and friend, Yang Zhanqing, who is based in the United States, told Reuters.
Since then, friends have heard no news about their alleged crimes or their whereabouts.
A third researcher who helped maintain the social media account had gone missing, Yang said.
Chen's disappearance was confirmed by another friend, who declined to be identified.
Police in Guangzhou responsible for Chen's home district did not comment and the security bureau in the area could not immediately be contacted.
The detentions follow a wider crackdown on worker support groups in China this year, the China Labor Bulletin said, with police raids on labor groups in Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
China's sanitation workers face some of the country's harshest working conditions, with low or unpaid wages and dangerous working conditions common, said William Nee, a business and human rights advisor at Amnesty International.
""Workers in this sector are often rural migrant workers with low levels of education and with scarce resources, so claiming their rights within the legal system without assistance can be difficult,"" Nee said.
Chen's assistant, who Yang identified as Miss Lu, started volunteering with Chen in the last few months.
The third assistant, identified as Mr Zhang, is a graduate student studying in Taiwan who was collecting material for his thesis. He had also been unreachable, Yang said."

About 300 people, mostly Africans, rallied outside the camp in Vathy demanding to be allowed to leave the island, a police official said. The official said there were brief clashes between police and protesters.
The facility has room for up to 650 people but it operates far beyond its capacity, like most such camps in Greece.
Human rights organizations have long criticized Greece, which was the main gateway into the European Union for more than a million people fleeing conflict in 2015-16, for its handling of the migrant crisis and its overcrowded camps.
Greece continues to be on the frontline of Europe's migration crisis and has seen a resurgence of arrivals through Turkey this year.
The conservative government, elected in July, has taken a tougher stance compared to its leftist predecessor, which it blames for adopting what it says is an ""open door"" policy towards arrivals.
The government, which has also classed most recent arrivals as economic migrants rather than refugees, has announced plans to shut overcrowded refugee camps on Aegean islands and replace them with restrictive holding centers to process new arrivals.
It plans to move up to 20,000 people to the mainland by the end of the year and expects new facilities will be ready by July 2020."
255,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 05:43AM ET</span>","Erdogan says 50,000 Syrians fleeing Idlib to Turkey","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that 50,000 people were fleeing Syria's northwestern region of Idlib to Turkey, and slammed Muslim nations for not supporting his plans to resettle refugees in other parts of north Syria.
Turkey currently hosts some 3.7 million Syrian refugees, the largest refugee population in the world, and fears another influx from the Idlib region, where up to 3 million Syrians live in the last significant insurgent-held swathe of territory.
Syrian and Russian forces carry out regular air strikes against targets in Idlib, which President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to recapture, pushing more people toward the Turkish border.
""Look, 50,000 people are once again coming from Idlib to our lands,"" Erdogan told a meeting of Muslim leaders in Malaysia. ""We already have 4 million people, and now another 50,000 are coming and this may increase.""
He gave no details and did not say whether the Syrians had actually crossed into Turkey, which has built a wall along its 911 km (570 mile) southern border since the outbreak of Syria's eight-year conflict. 
Erdogan is seeking international support for plans to settle 1 million Syrians in part of northeast Syria which Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies seized from the Kurdish YPG militia in a cross-border incursion in October.
Ankara has received little public backing for its plans and Erdogan said that world powers, including Muslim nations, were more concerned about sending arms to Syria than supporting a Turkish ""safe zone"".
""Is the Muslim world that poor? Why don't they support this?"" he said. ""Even if they just gave their alms, there would no poverty here, no have-nots,"" he said. 
""They provide no support when we call on them to form a safe zone, but when it comes to weapons, the arms come,"" he said.
In its third offensive into northern Syria in three years, Turkey seized a 120 km (75 mile) stretch of border territory two months ago from the YPG, which had spearheaded the fight against Islamic State in Syria with U.S. support.

Washington's backing for the YPG has infuriated Turkey, which considers it a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fighters who have waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey in which thousands of people have been killed.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 05:27AM ET</span>",Jailed Catalan leader was entitled to immunity as lawmaker: EU court,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - A Catalan leader jailed for his role in an independence referendum deemed illegal by Spain was entitled to immunity as member of the European Parliament despite not having being able to take up his seat, the EU's highest court ruled on Thursday. 
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling in respect of Oriol Junqueras marks a likely boost for the Catalan separatist movement and potentially puts judicial authorities in Brussels and Madrid at loggerheads.
Junqueras was sentenced in October to 13 years in jail for sedition and misuse of public funds related to the region's failed independence bid in autumn 2017, which Spanish authorities had declared illegal. 
He was elected to the European Parliament in May despite having been in prison in Spain since November 2017.
Eight other leading figures in the independence movement were sentenced to prison along with Junqueras, and the bitter standoff between them and the government in Madrid has dominated Spain's fragmented political landscape for more than two years. 
A spokeswoman for the government said it had no immediate comment on the ruling.
The court said that, if Spanish authorities wanted to prevent Junqueras traveling to the European Parliament, they would have to request that the Parliament waive his immunity.
That immunity means an MEP cannot be subject to detention or legal proceedings because of views expressed or votes cast, although it does not apply to an MEP who has committed an offense.
Catalan separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), of which Junqueras is chairman, demanded his immediate release following the verdict.
""The (court) ... acknowledges that he had immunity,"" the party wrote on Twitter. ""We demand that the trial be voided and (his) immediate freedom.""

257,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 05:24AM ET</span>",Hong Kong protesters march to consulates to drum up support on rights,"By Felix Tam
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong protesters rallied outside diplomatic missions on Thursday to urge foreign governments to follow the United States in passing human rights bills to raise pressure on Beijing and support their pro-democracy campaign.
Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed congressional legislation requiring the State Department to certify, at least once a year, that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy from Beijing to justify favorable U.S. trading terms.
About 1,000 people, most of them dressed in black and wearing face masks, marched on a route that took them by the consulates of Australia, Britain, the European Union, the United States, Japan and Canada, to drop off a petition.
British, EU and U.S. diplomats came out to receive it, and to take photographs with the protesters.
""What happens in Hong Kong is not just a local issue, it is about human rights and democracy. Foreign governments should understand how this city is being suppressed,"" said Suki Chan, who participated in the protest.
""We need to continue to seek international attention and let them know this movement is not losing momentum.""
Anti-government protests have roiled the financial hub for more than six months as anger grows over what many see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Beijing has blamed the unrest on ""foreign forces"" and said attempts to interfere in the Chinese-ruled city were doomed to fail. 
The U.S. legislation, which also threatens sanctions for human rights violations, came after similar ""citizen diplomacy"" petitions in Hong Kong this year and has been cheered by protesters waving the stars and stripes flag.
Beijing denounced the U.S. legislation and Hong Kong's government said it sent the wrong signal to the demonstrators and increased economic uncertainty.
The marchers' petition condemned police ""brutality"" and called on governments to ""stand with Hong Kong"" by passing legislation for visa sanctions and the freezing of assets of Chinese and Hong Kong officials.
The police say they have acted with restraint. 
Police said separately on Thursday they had arrested four people suspected of money laundering in relation to the protests and had frozen HK$70 million ($9 million) in bank deposits.
Chan Wai Kei, from the police's financial investigation and narcotics bureau, told reporters the four were part of a group asking for donations for arrested and injured protesters but used some of the money for personal investments.
'BE WATER ACT'
At the U.S. consulate, protesters called for the passage in the United States of a ""Be Water Act"", championed by Missouri Senator Josh Hawley and named after a protest slogan borrowed from martial arts legend Bruce Lee. 
The bill would freeze assets of Chinese nationals and state-owned enterprises believed to have contributed to suppressing freedom of speech in Hong Kong.
Thursday also marked the 35th anniversary of a treaty between China and Britain on Hong Kong's future, that set the stage for its 1997 handover.
British Foreign secretary Dominic Raab urged China in a statement to open dialogue with the protesters and respect the commitments in the treaty.
In 2017, China's foreign ministry said the 1984 joint declaration, signed by then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, was a historical document that no longer had any practical significance.
Beijing denies interfering in Hong Kong and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees a high degree of autonomy.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has this week been on a visit to the neighboring gambling hub of Macau, a former Portuguese colony which has been praised by Beijing for ""successfully"" implementing a similar type of government.
Xi will on Friday attend ceremonies for the 20th anniversary of Macau's handover to China. He is expected to announce economic perks as a reward for its stability and loyalty.
Hong Kong's special status, which helped it grow into a global financial center and avoid U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, is also important to Beijing, which uses the city as its main gateway to global capital.
But worries in Hong Kong about its freedoms, and the months of protests partly fueled by such worries, have raised questions about how the city should be run.
""The framework of 'one country, two systems' obviously is flawed,"" said protester Ivan Fung, a 30-year-old social worker.

""We have to let the international community know so that they can also help us.""

LONDON (Reuters) - More than 15 million tweets were posted during the campaign leading up to Britain's parliamentary election last week, election, up 66% on the previous election in 2017, Twitter said on Thursday.
The Dec. 12 election, billed as the most important in a generation, was notably acrimonious as activists, politicians, voters and journalists clashed over everything from Brexit to the health service and whether political leaders could be trusted. 
Almost 10,000 tweets were sent in just one minute shortly after the publication of the key exit poll, just after voting ended at 10 p.m.
Twitter was at the center of an early controversy about trust when Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ultimately victorious Conservatives rebranded their account during a TV debate as ""factcheckUK"".
Twitter warned the party not to mislead the public, and three days later barred political advertising from the platform. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said political conversation on the site should not be ""compromised by money"".
On the lighter side, pictures of dogs at polling stations trended from 7 a.m. on election day.

Canine-themed posts have become an election day tradition in recent years, and more than 122,000 #DogsAtPollingStations tweets were posted.

GENEVA (Reuters) - During talks on disarmament at the U.N.'s Geneva headquarters last month, alarm bells went off in the chamber to indicate that delegates had infringed new cost-cutting rules that restrict the length of meetings.
Screens and microphones were also shut off, forcing ambassadors to shout their speeches across the hall as events became ""chaotic, confusing and noisy"", and some feared the lights would be next, according to one of several people present who described the scene to Reuters.
""I was really concerned about the lights,"" said the Pakistani chair, Ambassador Khalil Hashmi, who eventually managed to get a limited agreement after assembling participants in a huddle. 
The disruptions - which have happened on at least two occasions - were the result of emergency measures to cut costs at U.N. centers such as Geneva and New York. 
The cuts, now in their third month, are a response to a situation described by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as ""extremely alarming"".
The United Nations has a $768 million hole in its $2.85 billion 2019 general budget because 51 countries have not paid all their fees, including two big paymasters: the United States and Brazil. Both say they intend to pay most of their dues, but even if they do, arrears remain from past years and spill into future budgets.
""Cash deficits occur earlier in the year, linger longer and run deeper,"" said Guterres.
Diplomats and analysts say the cash crisis points to some states' weak commitment to multilateral diplomacy, as evidenced by the suspension of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization's top appeals court and U.N. climate talks in Madrid last week reaching only a limited deal.
France and Germany have launched an ""Alliance for Multilateralism"" to support the U.N. and other institutions.
Richard Gowan, a U.N. expert at the International Crisis Group think-tank, said cash shortages were a symptom of a broader ""crisis of political confidence"" in the institution. ""Most U.N. members just aren't that bothered about the financial problems the organization faces,"" he said.
Ambassador Hashmi urged member states to pay their dues, saying important U.N. business should not be ""held hostage"" to financial constraints.
Some critics say the United Nations could spend less on perks and bloated, often tax-free, salaries for senior officials.
""There is huge waste in the U.N.,"" said Marc Limon, a former diplomat and Executive Director of Universal Rights Group. ""Instead of focusing on the U.N. mandate ... the U.N. spends a lot of money on high salaries in many cases."" 
U.N. officials have said they are unwilling at this stage to cut permanent staff salaries and are focusing on cutting costs in other areas. 
LIGHTS DIMMED
Built nearly 100 years ago to house the U.N.'s forerunner the League of Nations, Geneva's colossal Palais des Nations - the home of multilateralism - hosts thousands of meetings each year on everything from refugee rights to peace in Syria and is showing its age.
Telephone booths abound, its art deco facade is yellowing and a monument donated by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation needs treatment for corrosion. Switzerland is lending $800 million for works.
Corridor notices say the cash crisis has forced the closure of lifts and escalators. Hallway lights have been dimmed and some diplomats have brought in heaters as radiators have been dialed down despite the Swiss winter.
Nonetheless, a library exhibition celebrates 100 years of multilateralism since parades and fireworks first rang out in Geneva to celebrate the new ""city of peace"".
""The United Nations has been under pressure for many years to reduce its resources yet to deliver more. At one point it becomes very difficult,"" said Corinne Momal-Vanian, U.N. Geneva's director of conference management, who confirmed that meeting costs had been cut, for example, by using fewer interpreters and sound technicians.
Some speculate that cost-saving measures, thought to be making just small dents in the $14 million annual running costs for the Palais, are aimed more at annoying diplomats so they urge their capitals to pay up.
U.N. officials deny this and say savings are necessary.
Some critics question whether U.N. meetings such as deadlocked talks on nuclear weapons are worth pursuing at all, noting that any agreements get watered down by arms producers.

Mary Wareham, coordinator of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, described the process as zombie-like. ""We are looking outside the U.N. to where the action is.""

MANILA (Reuters) - A Philippine court found the bosses of an influential political clan guilty on Thursday of masterminding a 2009 massacre of 57 people, a ruling cheered as a partial victory for justice and a challenge to the country's notorious culture of impunity. 
Eight members of the powerful Ampatuan family were among 28 people sentenced to life imprisonment over their roles in a ambush on an election motorcade in Maguindanao province, and the gunning-down of all who witnessed it.
Among the victims of the ""Maguindanao Massacre"" were 32 journalists in what was one of the world's single biggest attacks on media.
The ambush was also the biggest instance of election violence in the Philippines, where assassinations are common in provincial politics, especially in Mindanao, a southern region prone to lawlessness and the rule of warlords aided by abundant arms.
The case was widely considered the trial of the decade in the Philippines due to the infamy of the Ampatuans, a dynasty with political connections that went all the way up to then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. 
It was also seen as a test of whether democratic institutions could withstand pressure from rich and powerful interests.
Fifteen other defendants were jailed on Thursday for accessory to murder and 56 were acquitted. Seven cases were dismissed, among them that of family patriarch, Andal Ampatuan, who died in prison of a heart attack in 2015.
Salvador Panelo, spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said the ruling should be respected and the massacre represented a ""merciless disregard for the sacredness of human life"" and should never be repeated. 
More than 80 of 197 suspects are still at large, including 12 Ampatuans, raising concerns that witnesses and victims' families might never be safe.
""This case has a long way to go,"" said Esmael Mangudadatu, a congressman whose wife was shot more than a dozen times during the ambush. 
""But at least we have a partial victory.""
'APPALLING IMPUNITY'
Mangudadatu was the challenger to the Ampatuans in a gubernatorial election but was not in the convoy attacked in broad daylight by his rival's private army. 
The victims were executed beside a rural road in volleys of gunfire, before being buried with their vehicles in a huge pit dug by an excavator.
The trial involved 357 witnesses and 238 volumes of documents and dragged on for a decade, with much time lost to deliberations over bail requests. 
Several witnesses were assassinated, according to activists.
Rights group Amnesty International hailed the verdict as a positive step but said suspects at large should be prosecuted and an end brought to an ""appalling culture of impunity and injustice"".
Human Rights Watch said the ruling should spur more reforms to hold power to account, and outlaw private militias.

""This verdict should prompt the country's political leaders to finally act to end state support for 'private armies' and militias that promotes the political warlordism that gave rise to the Ampatuans,"" said the group's deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police detained hundreds of people in New Delhi and southern city of Bengaluru on Thursday and shut down the internet in some places as protests entered a second week over a new citizenship law that critics say undermines India's secular constitution.
Citing law and order concerns following violent protests against the law during the past week, authorities imposed bans against public gatherings in parts of the capital and two big states - Uttar Pradesh in the north and Karnataka in the south.
Defying the bans, protesters held rallies at Delhi's historic Red Fort and a town hall in Bengaluru, Karnataka's state capital, but police swept in to round up people in the vanguard of those demonstrations as they tried to get underway.
In Bengaluru, Ramchandra Guha, a respected historian and intellectual, was taken away by police along with several other professors, according to an aide. 
""I am protesting non-violently, but look they are stopping us,"" said Guha before being surrounded by police.
Police said they had detained around 200 people in the city, where according to protest organizers thousands of people attended four protests held in the city on Thursday.
At the Red Fort protest, academic turned politician Yogendra Yadav as among some 100 that police said they had detained.
""We are here to peacefully demonstrate against this law,"" Mohammed Maz, a bearded middle-aged protester told Reuters as he was led away by police.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has dug his heels in over the law that lays out a path for people from minority religions in neighboring Muslim countries - Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan - who had settled in India before 2015 to obtain Indian citizenship. 
Opponents of the law say the exclusion of Muslims betrays a deep-seated bias against the community, which makes up 14% of India's population, and that the law is the latest move in a series by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to marginalize them.
Train stations around Red Fort were shut to prevent protesters joining the rally, and authorities also ordered mobile carriers to suspend internet services in some parts of the capital.
""As per the directive received from the government, data services are stopped at a few locations,""  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) Idea's customer care tweeted in response to a user's question about its network in Delhi.
In Hyderabad, another major city in the south, 50 protesting students were detained by police, according to a media report said. 
On Sunday, police stormed New Delhi's Jamia Millia University, firing tear gas and wielding batons to break up a protest by hundreds of students, injuring scores. 
During a violent protest in another part of the capital this week, protesters, some masked, fought pitched battles with police.
Anger against Modi's government has burst into the open after a series of moves that were seen as advancing a Hindu-first agenda in a country that has long celebrated its diversity and secular constitution. 

In August, the government took away Muslim majority Kashmir's autonomy and later the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on a site disputed by Muslims, and had been a flashpoint for years.

Officials in New South Wales (NSW) state declared the second state-wide emergency in as many months on Thursday as more than 100 fires burned across the state, more than half of them uncontrolled.
Three major blazes were burning around Sydney, blanketing the harbor city in ash and smoke, as temperatures soared above 45 degrees Celsius (113°F) in some areas. 
The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) posted footage on its official Twitter account of one of those fires, at Green Wattle Creek, around 80 kms (50 miles) southeast of Sydney, as it jumped a railway line.
The short clip showed the waterbomber aircraft flying through the thick cloud to dump water on flames burning in bushland just meters from homes. 
The RFS has warned people in high-danger areas to evacuate early as ""there are simply not enough fire trucks for every house"".
""If you call for help, you may not get it,"" the RFS said in an alert issued on Thursday. ""Do not expect a fire truck. Do not expect a knock on the door. Do not expect a phone call.""

But this week Singapore police had to clarify that using a phone while crossing the road was not illegal after rumors circulated online that doing so could result in a S$1,000 ($733) fine under revised rules.
""There is a message circulating online which claims erroneously that pedestrians who use their mobile phones while crossing the roads may be fined up to $1,000, from 1 December 2019. This is false,"" Singapore police said in a statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""However, we advise pedestrians to avoid using such devices when crossing the road, as such usage would distract them from the road conditions and the movement of vehicles around them.""
All major domestic media outlets including broadcaster Channel NewsAsia and the Straits Times newspaper carried the police clarification.
But some people said such a law would be a good idea.
""Please make this an offence, simply because people who do this have no regards for other people's safety, and many a time at the traffic lights vehicles have to wait for them to finish crossing even when the lights are not in their favor,"" reader Alan Kiong commented on the Straits Times' Facebook page.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Hosting a summit of Muslim leaders, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad bemoaned the state of Islam and defended the meeting that has been shunned by Saudi Arabia and criticized for undermining the bigger Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
Divisions in the Muslim world were self-evident as only about 20 countries sent leaders, or delegations to the Kuala Lumpur summit, though all 57 members of the OIC had been invited.
The Saudi king's refusal to attend, and the late withdrawal of Pakistan from the event had left the hosts scrambling to soothe sensitive relations.
In welcoming remarks, Mahathir said the Kuala Lumpur Summit was meant to understand why Islam, the Muslims and their countries were ""in a state of crisis, helpless and unworthy of this great religion"".
It was unclear to what extent the leaders would discuss major geo-political crises afflicting the Muslim world, ranging from the age-old disputes in the Middle East and Kashmir, to the conflicts in Syria and Yemen, through to the plight of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and the alleged persecution of Uighur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region.
Mahathir said the summit, which will end on Saturday, should address the world's perceptions of Islam, the rise of Islamophobia, the decline of the Islamic civilization and reforms in governance needed by Muslim nations.
""We are not discriminating or isolating anyone,"" he said in his welcome speech, watched on by leaders including Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamid Al-Thani.
""We are attempting to start small and if these ideas, proposals and solutions are acceptable and proved workable, then we hope to take it up to the larger platform for consideration.""
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan struck a similar tone.
""We will have the opportunity to talk freely about our issues, from Islamophobia to terrorism, divisions, internal fights ravaging our region, and sectarian and ethnic conflicts,” Erdogan told the summit.
The OIC had said it was against the interests of the Islamic community to convene meetings outside the Saudi-based organization, which has for decades acted as the collective voice of the Muslim world.
Both Mahathir and Erdogan have been frustrated by the OIC's past record of hand-wringing and failure to take firm action in support of Muslim causes. 
Without mentioning the OIC by name, Erdogan said the biggest problem that platforms bringing the Islamic world together faced was a lack of implementation.
""If we still haven't made any progress regarding the Palestinian cause, if we still can't stop the exploitation of our resources, if we still can't say ""stop"" to the fragmentation of the Muslim world over sectarianism, that's why.”
Some analysts also suspected that Saudi Arabia's reluctance to attend stemmed from fear of being diplomatically isolated by regional rivals Iran, Qatar and Turkey, all of whom are attending the summit.
Worried about taking sides, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan opted to stay away from the Kuala Lumpur summit.

""Pakistan wants to become part of the solution and not part of the problem,"" Information Minister Firdous Ashiq Awan told reporters in Islamabad.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican officials concerned about the health of Mexican asylum seekers including around 200 young children sleeping in the open near the U.S. border in Ciudad Juarez tried to move people to shelters on Wednesday, as temperatures dropped below freezing. 
In recent months, Ciudad Juarez has seen a rapid increase in Mexicans seeking to apply for asylum in the United States, leading to a backlog in the city as U.S. border officials limit the number of asylum cases they receive at the port of entry each day.
A waiting list contains about 1,200 people, of which about 550 are staying in camps near the bridge to the United States, the Chihuahua state government said. Nearly half of those in the camps are children under the age of 12. 
""For their own good, they can't be in these public spaces,"" said Enrique Valenzuela, who heads the civil protection services in Chihuahua state and was trying to persuade the migrants to shift to shelters.
""It is for the good of their sons and daughters who are exposed to crime and above all the inclement weather.""
Weather forecasts predict freezing temperatures in the Ciudad Juarez-El Paso area through the weekend. 
Policies under U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at reducing the number of new arrivals in the United States have led to tens of thousands of mainly Central American asylum seekers living for months in Mexico as they await U.S. court dates or interviews with border officials. 
Immigration advocates say the policies expose vulnerable populations to crime, extortion and the elements.
On Wednesday, a grandfather from the state of Zacatecas sat at a small grill where people were cooking breakfast, scrambling chilli and eggs while his one-year old granddaughter sat in a chair bundled up in multiple sweaters. 
The coffee he drank was made with water that was still frozen when they tried to pour it into a pot for boiling.
Giving only his first name for fear of reprisals, Rodrigo said he traveled with his son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter to escape violence in their home state. 
The family all slept in a tent together, insulating it with cardboard and sheets of plastic. As temperatures dropped to 24 Fahrenheit (-4 Celsius) in the early morning, the baby woke up crying, Rodrigo said.
His family had been waiting for more than two months to be called on the asylum list, Rodrigo said, and had no plans to leave for shelters despite the weather forecast.
“We have only ten families ahead of us on the list, so we’ll cross in the next eight days or so...if you’re not here for the roll call in the morning your family gets removed from the list after two or three absences,” Rodrigo said.
One woman who declined to give her name said she was considering moving to another city to escape both the cold and what she feared were cartel members who had followed her from Guerrero state.
Other families said they would leave the camp, worried children would fall sick. Some families have decided to cross the border illegally rather than wait, they said. 

Officials in Chihuahua state were seeking a meeting with their U.S. counterparts to discuss the situation in the camps, a Mexican official said, requesting anonymity. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment.

271,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>",Change to Chinese university's charter dropping 'freedom of thought' stirs debate,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Changes to the charter of one of China's top universities that dropped the phrase ""freedom of thought"" and added a pledge to follow the Communist Party's leadership have sparked heated debate and a rare act of student defiance.
The changes to the charter of Fudan University in Shanghai, considered one of China's more liberal institutions, came to light on Tuesday when the education ministry said it had approved alterations for three universities.
Within hours, the Fudan amendments were trending on the Weibo social media platform with one hashtag viewed more than a million times.
""If I may dare to ask those who initiated the amendment of the Fudan University charter, how do you expect our generation of Fudan people to face our ancestors,"" said one Weibo user.
But that post and many similar ones questioning the changes - in particular the removal of the phrase ""freedom of thought"" - were deleted by Wednesday afternoon, although the issue was being discussed in private WeChat groups.
Since Communist Party leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China has tightened controls on the internet and civil society in a campaign that has seen increasing censorship and shrinking space for dissent, including on campuses.
Xi has also sought to boost the party's role and deepen its influence across society.
A video circulating on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon showed a group of Fudan University students singing their college anthem, which includes the phrase ""freedom of thought"", during their lunch break.
Students there confirmed to Reuters that the event had taken place.
Calls to Fudan University's press department on Wednesday to seek comment went unanswered. The Ministry of Education did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
Late on Wednesday, the 114-year-old university posted a statement on social media saying the charter alterations had been made ""in strict accordance with legal procedures"".
It also noted, however, that the school would continue to have the same anthem. The song, composed in 1925, includes the phrase ""academic independence and freedom of thought"".
The party has kept an eagle eye on campuses to nip would-be dissent in the bud since university students led pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in 1989.
Universities in China have long operated without full academic independence. Curricula are bound by Communist Party diktats and political norms that render certain topics or positions off limits.
Still, some commentators on Weibo noted how the amendments pointed to an expansion of Communist Party control, with the revised charter saying that Fudan's ""party committee is the core of the university"" and would be responsible for setting its direction and making major decisions.
The new charter said the university would ""weaponise the minds of teachers and students using Xi Jinping’s socialism ideology with characteristics of China in the new era”.
Fudan is ranked 109 globally in the Times Higher Education's 2020 World University Rankings. 
The two other universities that made changes to their charters were Shaanxi Normal University and Nanjing University, according to documents published by the Ministry of Education, which showed that it had approved the changes on Dec. 2

Their revised charters similarly included references to strengthening the leadership of the Communist Party at the universities.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 09:46PM ET</span>",Warrant not always needed for 'inadvertent' NSA surveillance of Americans: U.S. court,"By Mark Hosenball
(Reuters) - The U.S. government may collect information about U.S. citizens without obtaining a warrant if the information is gathered inadvertently while legally carrying out surveillance of non-nationals abroad, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Wednesday.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in an appeal by Agron Hasbajrami, a U.S. resident arrested in 2011 and who later pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization.
Hasbajrami challenged the charges, questioning whether the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) had legally obtained information about him without a warrant.
The ""incidental collection"" of Americans' communications by NSA electronic dragnet that explicitly targets people abroad and without U.S. ties was permissible under the U.S. Constitution, the court ruled. It also said, however, that examining the content of databases of stored NSA information could violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
The court said the ""vast majority"" of evidence prosecutors had used against Hasbajrami was ""lawfully collected,"" but prosecutors did not provide information to the trial court about whether investigators had ""queried"" NSA databases.
The NSA surveillance program is sometimes called PRISM, which gathers data from tech and telecom companies under court supervision and under the authority of section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) but without individual warrants. 
""We are gratified by the Court’s remand to resolve a critical factual and constitutional question in this case, as well as its recognition of the important constitutional issues that FISA section 702 raises for everyone. We look forward to the next stage of the litigation,"" Hasbajrami's lawyer Joshua Dratel said in a statement.
A spokesman for federal prosecutors in Brooklyn declined to comment.
The case of Hasbajrami, arrested at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport as he attempted to board a flight to Turkey, was returned to the trial court for a determination about whether evidence against him was lawfully collected and admissible under the Fourth Amendment. Prosecutors said Hasbajrami communicated by email with a non-American overseas, who he believed was associated with a terrorist organization.
Documents detailing NSA telephone and internet surveillance were leaked by former agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. Although he is viewed by some as a hero who upheld the U.S. Constitution, authorities want him to stand trial over his disclosures of classified information.

""While we disagree with the court’s ruling that the NSA can collect Americans' international communications without a warrant ... the court rightly finds that the Fourth Amendment applies when the government searches for that sensitive information in intelligence databases,"" said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Patrick Toomey, who filed a brief in the case.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court ruled on Wednesday that a component of the Obamacare law is unconstitutional, but dodged a major ruling by stopping short of declaring that the rest of the landmark 2010 healthcare statute must also be struck down.
The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on a 2-1 vote that the law's individual mandate that directed Americans to obtain health insurance - a provision already gutted by Republican-backed legislation passed in Congress - was unlawful.
The court, however, avoided answering the key question of whether the rest of the law can remain in place or must be struck down, instead sending the case back to a district court judge for further analysis. That means the fate of the signature domestic achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama remains in limbo.
Writing for the majority, Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod said that Texas-based U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor must ""employ a finer-toothed comb"" to determine if the entire law must be struck down.
In 2018, O'Connor ruled the entire law was unconstitutional.
Elrod wrote that it may be that the law does eventually have to be struck down in full, but ""it is no small thing for unelected, life-tenured judges to declare duly enacted legislation passed by the elected representatives of the American people unconstitutional.""
The dissenting judge, Carolyn Dineen King, said she would have found that the challengers had no legal standing to bring the lawsuit. She also said the rest of the law could be upheld even if the individual mandate was unconstitutional.
The law has drawn Republican ire since its passage. Congressional Republicans tried and failed numerous times to repeal it, and the Trump administration has taken several actions to undermine it.
""The 5th Circuit correctly held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and we look forward to the opportunity to further demonstrate that Congress made the individual mandate the centerpiece of Obamacare and the rest of the law cannot stand without it,"" said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who leads the legal challenge brought by 18 conservative-led states.
President Donald Trump, a Republican, said the decision would not change the current U.S. healthcare system.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would fight Republican efforts to rollback Obamacare. 
“Tonight’s ruling is a chilling threat to the 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions and every other family who depends on the lifesaving protections of the Affordable Care Act,"" she said in a statement. 
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who heads a coalition of 20 Democratic-led states defending the law, said the ruling means Trump ""got the gift he wanted -- uncertainty in the healthcare system and a pathway to repeal.""
California will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general said.
Obamacare has helped roughly 20 million Americans obtain medical insurance either through government programs or through policies from private insurers made available in Obamacare marketplaces. Republican opponents have called the law an unwarranted intervention by government in health insurance markets.
In 2012, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld most Obamacare provisions including the individual mandate, which required people to obtain insurance or pay a financial penalty. The court defined this penalty as a tax and thus found the law permissible under the Constitution's provision empowering Congress to levy taxes. 
In 2017, Trump signed into law a tax bill passed by a Republican-led Congress that eliminated the financial penalty under the individual mandate. 
The 2017 law means the individual mandate can no longer be interpreted as a tax provision and is therefore unlawful, the appeals court concluded in Wednesday's ruling.

Trump's administration supported the legal challenge and declined to defend the law in court.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia must abandon criticism of China and see the development of its largest trading partner as an opportunity if bilateral relations are to improve, Beijing's ambassador to Canberra said on Thursday.
Relations between Australia and its most important trading partner have deteriorated in recent years amid accusations that China is meddling in Australia's domestic affairs. Canberra also fears China is seeking undue influence in the Pacific region.
Souring relations have strained bilateral trade, prompting some business executives to urge Australia's conservative government to prioritize economic policy above national security and human rights.
In rare public comments, Cheng Jingye, China's ambassador to Australia, described 2019 as a ""mixed year"" for the relationship.
""I think it is important ... to look at each other's development as an opportunity, rather than a threat,"" Cheng told reporters in Sydney.
Australia has for months sought to ease bilateral tensions by refraining from public criticism of China.
But in recent weeks, several senior government officials have said Canberra would not be silenced about concerns such as China's militarization of the South China Sea, its treatment of ethnic minorities and its detention of Australian citizens.
In October, Australia drew a rebuke from China when it said it would continue to speak about the treatment of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province in China.
China has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in remote Xinjiang it describes as ""vocational training centers"" intended to stamp out extremism and teach new skills.
The United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained.
Cheng denied the allegations.
""Uighurs in detention is utterly fake news,"" said Cheng, who then showed journalists a video that portrayed Uighurs as radicals.
Cheng also denied Australia's allegations that China was mistreating a Chinese-born Australian writer detained by Beijing for almost a year.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australian consular officials who recently visited Yang had reported ""unacceptable"" conditions, including isolation and daily interrogations, sometimes while he was shackled.
Cheng insisted China is treating Yang Hengjun, a former Chinese diplomat turned online journalist and blogger, humanely.
Yang was formally arrested in August on suspicion of espionage, seven months after he was detained in the southern city of Guangzhou.
Espionage is punishable by death in China."

When the quake opened a faultline deep beneath the Indian Ocean, it triggered a wave as high as 17.4 meters (57 feet), wiping some communities off the map in seconds.
Northern Aceh province bore the brunt of the disaster, where a total of 128,858 people were killed, according to statistics compiled by the government and aid agencies.
Day by day, the death toll rose, as bodies littered the streets, waiting to be collected, and others continued to wash ashore, decaying among piles of debris.
Hospitals and morgues struggled to cope with injured and bewildered victims and bloated corpses.
Over 570,000 people were displaced and 179,000 buildings and homes destroyed in Indonesia as the wave swallowed large parts of the coastline. Massive reconstruction aid in Banda Aceh has since rebuilt a new city on top of the ruins.
Sri Lanka was the next worst-affected country with a death toll of about 40,000, while in Thailand almost 5,400 people were killed including many foreign tourists.
In India, nearly 42,000 people, or close to 10,000 families, were rendered homeless by the waves that struck islands off the eastern coast. More than 3,500 people were killed and nearly 9,000 died on the mainland, mostly in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.
The tsunami garnered an enormous international response, with an estimated $13.6 billion in official aid and private donations pledged for the recovery.
WARNING SYSTEM
Those killed in 2004 received no formal warning of the approaching waves and had almost no chance to get out of the way.
Since then, millions of dollars have gone into a vast network of seismic and tsunami information centers, setting up sea and coastal instruments and erecting warning towers.
More than $400 million has been spent across 28 countries on the early-warning system, comprising 101 sea-level gauges, 148 seismometers and nine buoys.
But doubts linger about how ready countries on the Indian Ocean really are for another giant wave.
Some experts say complacency about the maintenance of the system is leaving millions vulnerable and governments still warn of the ever-present risks."

The treaty signed on Dec. 19, 1984 pledged that Hong Kong’s high-degree of autonomy would be unchanged for 50 years after the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997.
But fears China may start to clamp down have led to months of often violent street protests in the territory.
""Hong Kong is experiencing its greatest period of turmoil since the handover,"" British Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.
""The agreement between the UK and China made clear that Hong Kong’s high-degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years,"" he added.
""The undertakings made by China, including the right to freedom of expression, an independent judiciary and the rule of law are essential to Hong Kong’s prosperity and way of life.""

In a ceremony that marks a new parliament, Queen Elizabeth will read out the laws which the government wants the House of Commons to approve and will pinpoint Johnson's priorities after winning a commanding majority at last week's national election.
The prime minister, who won over many traditional supporters of the main opposition Labour Party in northern and central England, has proclaimed he will lead a ""people's government"" and will move to fulfil his pledge to ""get Brexit done"".
The Queen's Speech will include new legislation needed to implement the future relationship Johnson has promised to agree with the EU by the end of 2020. He plans to pass the laws needed to finalize the divorce agreement by Jan. 31.
He will also cement his commitment to spend more on Britain's much-loved but struggling National Health Service by prioritizing legislation to guarantee funding increases, rising to an extra 33.9 billion pounds per year by 2023-24.
""The NHS is the single greatest institution in this country,"" he told a reception of health workers late on Wednesday. ""We are now putting the biggest investment in the NHS in living memory. We have to keep that investment going.""
On Tuesday, Johnson told his top team of ministers that they ""ain't seen nothing yet folks"", warning them that there was much to do to pay back the trust offered his government in the election on Dec. 12 when he won a majority of 80.
After more than three years of debate over Brexit, Johnson wants to move quickly to try to unite a country riven by disagreements over how, when or whether Britain should leave the EU. Towns, villages and even families have been fractured.
His aides say he is also determined to try to keep the support of those voters in northern and central England, many of whom voted for the governing Conservatives for the first time, by trying to make their lives better.
With a healthy majority, he should be able to fulfil his priority to ""get Brexit done"" and is expected to announce that the divorce agreement, or Withdrawal Agreement Bill, is brought back to parliament before Christmas and then passed quickly.
He will also offer some insight into how he wants to tackle the domestic concerns highlighted in the election campaign.

Beyond increased funding for the NHS, he is also expected to outline measures to strengthen the justice system, improve transport, better protect those people who rent their homes and kickstart talks to restore the government in Northern Ireland.

PEZINOK, Slovakia (Reuters) - A Slovak businessman and three others will appear in court for the first time on Thursday charged over the murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancee, a case that triggered mass protests against graft in the central European state.
Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova, both 27, were gunned down in their house outside the capital Bratislava in February 2018.
Prosecutors say entrepreneur Marian Kocner, a subject of Kuciak’s reporting on fraud cases involving politically connected businessmen, had contracted his killing.
Kocner and two alleged accomplices have pleaded not guilty while the fourth suspect has confessed to the shooting itself, according to public television RTVS, quoting police sources. They face up to life in prison if convicted.
A fifth man has confessed to facilitating the killing and has made a plea deal with prosecutors to act as a witness.
At a preliminary hearing in the town of Pezinok north of Bratislava, judges will either set the date for the trial or ask prosecutors to submit more evidence first.
The murders stoked public anger over perceived corruption in Slovakia, a country of 5.4 million people, leading to the biggest protests since communism ended three decades earlier.
The case is seen as a test of Slovak police and judicial independence given that the investigation exposed business and personal links between Kocner and security officials.
Prosecutors said in August they had extracted tens of thousands of messages from Kocner’s phone containing communication with ""representatives of state bodies and the justice system"".
The revelations led to a number of resignations of senior officials in the past weeks, including a deputy parliament speaker, a deputy minister, two prosecutors and a judge. All denied any connection to the murders.
Slovakia's former chief prosecutor was charged this week with abuse of power for hiding recordings from a secret service operation which also involved Kocner.
Mass protests forced Prime Minister Robert Fico to resign last year. He was replaced by a party ally and his leftist, socially conservative Smer party still leads the government as it has for 11 out of the past 13 years.
Smer's popular support has waned but it still tops opinion polls, although a wide collection of opposition parties could nudge it out of power in the Feb. 29 election."

According to a Reuters photographer at the scene, the highway was largely closed to traffic as forensic workers extracted bodies from the wreck, wrapped them in black plastic bags and placed them into white vans belonging to the Jalisco coroner.

    The resolution, sponsored by dozens of countries including the United States, was adopted by the 193-member General Assembly without a vote. Such resolutions are non-binding but can carry political weight.
    North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Kim Song told the General Assembly that the resolution has ""nothing to do with the genuine promotion and protection of human rights, as it is an impure product of political plots by hostile forces that seek to tarnish the dignity and image of the DPRK and overthrow our social system.""
    North Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
    A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim Jong Un himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.
    Then in 2016, the United States angered North Korea by blacklisting Kim for human rights abuses.
    Earlier this month at least eight U.N. Security Council members pushed for a meeting on human rights abuses in North Korea. Pyongyang responded that it would consider such a move a ""serious provocation"" to which it would ""respond strongly.""
Diplomats said a meeting would have prompted China to call a vote to stop it, even though it would not have enough support.
    But the United States, which is president of the Security Council for December, decided to convene a meeting that instead focused on concerns that North Korea could resume nuclear or long-range missile testing - suspended since 2017 - because denuclearization talks between Pyongyang and Washington have stalled.
On Monday, China and Russia proposed the 15-member Council lift a ban on North Korea exporting statues, seafood and textiles, and ease restrictions on infrastructure projects and North Koreans working overseas, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters.
    A U.S. State Department official said on Monday that now was not the time to consider lifting U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
    The United States, Britain and France have insisted that no U.N. sanctions should be lifted until North Korea takes concrete steps to give up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pyongyang has been subject to U.N. sanctions because of those programs since 2006."

LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will on Thursday demand the right to hold a new independence referendum, challenging Prime Minister Boris Johnson to keep the United Kingdom together as he grapples with its coming split from the European Union.
A month before Britain embarks on its momentous journey out of the EU, Sturgeon will say she has won a mandate to call for a fresh independence vote after winning 47 of the 59 seats in Scotland in last week's election, 11 more than in 2017.
Sturgeon, who heads Edinburgh’s pro-independence devolved government, will publish a document called ""Scotland’s Right to Choose"", demanding Britain's parliament transfer the power to Scotland's devolved parliament to authorize a new referendum, setting the stage for a constitutional stand-off.
It is ultimately up to the British parliament to decide whether Scotland can hold a new referendum, and Johnson’s government has repeatedly said it will reject any demand for another vote.
""There is a clear mandate for this nation to have the power to decide its own future,"" Sturgeon will say, according to extracts released by her office. ""The result of last week’s general election makes that mandate unarguable.""
Scots rejected independence by 55 to 45 percent in a 2014 referendum but a three-year political crisis in London and differences over Brexit have strained the bonds that tie the United Kingdom together.
Every region of Scotland voted to stay in the EU in 2016, while the United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave, leading Sturgeon to claim a new referendum is justified as Scotland is now being dragged out of the bloc against its will.
If Scotland voted for independence it would mean the United Kingdom would lose about a third of its landmass, almost a tenth of its population, a core ingredient of its identity, and rip apart the world's fifth biggest economy.
Opinion polls suggest Scottish support for leaving the United Kingdom is far stronger than it was before the start of the 2014 campaign, although most polls suggest there is not currently a majority in favor.
In her speech, Sturgeon will reiterate she will only seek to secede from the United Kingdom through a properly agreed referendum.
""We understand that a referendum must be accepted as legitimate, here in Scotland and the UK, as well as in the EU and the wider international community,"" she will say.
Unionists say independence would needlessly break up the United Kingdom and usher in years of financial, economic and political uncertainty."

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday broke ranks with some fellow Republicans who have suggested the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court should be shuttered, calling it a ""critical tool"" in assisting law enforcement in keeping Americans safe and should be allowed to continue operating.
""We are committed to preserving FISA,"" Barr told reporters at a news conference in Detroit, referring to the federal law that created the court and establishes the process by which law enforcement and intelligence agencies seek requests for surveillance warrants.
""We think all Americans should be committed to preserving FISA. It is essential to protect the security of the United States,"" Barr said.
The role of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has become a hot subject of controversy.
The Justice Department's Inspector General Michael Horowitz last week issued a scathing report that faulted the FBI for 17 errors and omissions in applications submitted to the court when it sought to wiretap President Donald Trump's former campaign adviser Carter Page as part of its investigation into contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia.
The errors had the cumulative effect of making the applications for surveillance appear stronger by not disclosing countervailing evidence, Horowitz found. 
In one egregious example, a former FBI lawyer doctored an email by claiming that Page was not a source for another U.S. intelligence agency, when in fact he was a source for an extended period.
Since the report was made public, some prominent Republicans including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes have openly suggested the FISA court might need to be shut if major reforms are not implemented.
In addition, the court's presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer on Tuesday issued an unusual public order calling on the government to inform the court by Jan. 10 on how the FBI plans to ensure that the facts in its applications are presented accurately.
FBI Director Chris Wray has pledged to reform the bureau's policies and procedures for how it applies for surveillance warrants.
""I have put in place and ordered these 40-plus reforms, which are serious steps which go above and beyond even what the inspector general recommended,"" Wray told reporters at an event with Barr on Wednesday.
Barr made his comments on the FISA court during an unrelated news conference in Detroit where he, Wray, and the heads of the Justice Department's other law enforcement components unveiled Operation Relentless Pursuit - a new effort to provide additional federal resources to seven U.S. cities facing problems with violent crimes.
The initiative will allocate up to $71 million in federal grant funding and re-assign federal agents to assist with investigations in Detroit; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Baltimore; Cleveland; Kansas City, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee and Milwaukee.

GENEVA (Reuters) - States have pledged more than $3 billion to support refugees and about 50,000 resettlement places, the United Nations refugee agency said on Wednesday at the end of a ministerial conference.
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said that the Global Forum on Refugees had broadened responsibility-sharing for 25.9 million refugees who have fled war and persecution, mainly exiled in poor neighboring countries.
Grandi told a final news conference that the $3 billion was in addition to the World Bank and other pledges. The private sector pledged $250 million, but all the figures were preliminary, Grandi said.
Germany, which has taken in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, pledged some 1.7 billion euros, Grandi said. The Inter-American Development Bank pledged $1 billion to communities hosting refugees in Latin America, while the World Bank announced it was expanding funding for projects supporting refugees by 10% to $2.2 billion, Grandi added. 
States pledged 50,000 new resettlement and other legal pathways for refugees to remain in host countries, he said.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump said in September that it planned to allow only 18,000 refugees to resettle in the United States in the 2020 fiscal year, the lowest number in the history of the modern refugee program. 
The right to claim asylum, enshrined in international law, remains ""under threat"", Grandi said, without naming names.
""The reality is there has been no real systematic burden- and responsibility-sharing,"" he said.
""We cannot go into a world in which responsibility-sharing means some states keep all the refugees and some states pay all the money. We cannot do that, that is why we have resettlement, why we have different types of partnerships.

""That is why asylum has to remain a reality in all parts of the world including in the rich countries and even more in rich countries that have so many responsibilities,"" Grandi said.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Albania's parliament on Wednesday passed an anti-defamation package criticized by journalists and the Council of Europe as an attempt to muzzle the media while the government countered it was merely regulating ""a jungle of misinformation and hate.""
Parliament adjusted two laws to empower the Albanian Media Authority (AMA) and the Authority of Electronic and Postal Communications to hear complaints about news websites, demand retractions, impose fines of up to 1 million leke ($9,013.88), and suspend their activity.
The journalists, who protested by wearing black scarves outside parliament, said that the measures were tantamount to censure.
More than a dozen media organizations condemned the law and said they would start an information campaign that would also aim to kill those bills or nullify them with litigation.
""We call on journalists to keep working by reporting truthfully and correctly and fear not the existence of these regressive laws,"" the media organizations said in a statement.
The package was initially meant to cover some 700 to 800 online news sites that have sprung up over the last decade, but may also apply to TV stations, according to last-minute changes.
""This law says 'if we do not like your news story, we can remove it and fine you'"", said editor Enton Abilekaj.
Prime Minister Edi Rama told parliament the move intended to stop fake news or slander from causing loss of life or pressing businesses for bribes by shaming the quality of their products.
The law did not violate at all the right to free speech and opinion, but restored dignity to the slandered, Rama added.
""This is a jungle that takes money right and left ... A jungle that produces hate, misinformation and despair,"" he told the chamber.
Dunja Mijatovic, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, said the laws were in urgent need of improvement.
The powers given to AMA, the possibility of excessive fines and the blocking of media websites without a court order ""may deal a strong blow to freedom of expression and media"".
""Several provisions are indeed not compatible with international and European human rights standards which protect freedom of expression and freedom of the media,"" she said.

Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has vowed to keep reforming its justice system after winning an election in October, putting it on a collision course with the European Union which has repeatedly argued the reforms are in breach of EU law and Poland's constitution.
PiS says its reforms are necessary to make the court system more efficient.
Several thousand people gathered in front of Poland's parliament in Warsaw, where protesters chanted ""Free courts!"" and ""We will win!"" while waving Polish flags.
""An enslaved court leads to an enslaved nation... I've seen how communist mechanisms work and I don't want a repeat. It's also my country, not just the ruling government's,"" said Ewa Karbowska, 59, who attended the Warsaw protest.
Protesters also gathered in the cities of Wroclaw, Torun, Poznan, Szczecin, Katowice and Bialystok, among others, carrying EU flags, with some wearing tape over their mouths that said ""Today judges, tomorrow us,"" according to private broadcaster TVN.
Under draft legislation expected to be discussed in parliament on Thursday, PiS aims to prevent judges from ruling that peers, nominated by a panel appointed by the PiS-dominated parliament, are not independent.
Parliament's Bureau Of Research on Tuesday wrote an opinion in which it said the draft law as it stood could be in breach of EU law, specifically calling into question the independence and impartiality of the court and judges.
There were protests earlier this year after a judge from the city of Olsztyn was suspended for questioning the ruling party's judicial reforms."

BARQUISIMETO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Last August, Francys Rivero, an unemployed single mother of four, feared for her baby's life. Two months after his birth, even though she was breastfeeding him regularly, Kenai de Jesus wasn't gaining weight.
""I feel like my heart is breaking,"" Rivero, 32, told Reuters in an interview here in the capital of the western Venezuelan state of Lara. ""I don't know what's wrong with my son.""
She tried repeatedly to see nutritionists, but failed. One didn't show up, another required a month-long wait. Desperate, Rivero attended a charity event offering checkups and information for families of children with nutritional problems.
At the event, organized by Caritas, the Catholic aid organization, doctors performed a check-up. With donations from the charity, and financial assistance from siblings now living abroad, Rivero began supplementing her breast milk with baby formula.
Within weeks, Kenai rebounded. By December, he reached an acceptable weight for his age. But Rivero, like many enduring a recession now in its sixth year, fears she could once again find herself short of the money needed to keep him healthy. 
""How am I going to afford such expensive food?"" she asks. 
Venezuela's economic crisis is taking a crippling toll on the country's children, who face a growing risk of malnutrition as basic food is increasingly out of reach for many families. The public health system, notoriously short of medicine and other standard supplies, is unable to provide much succor, and aid groups struggle to bridge the gap.
President Nicolas Maduro, increasingly a global pariah for undermining democracy and overseeing the country's economic collapse, blames the crisis and food shortages on U.S. sanctions meant to force him from power.
The leader, also accused of overseeing widespread human-rights abuses and turning a blind eye to suffering across the once-prosperous country, often says foreign media and global aid organizations exaggerate Venezuela's problems.
A lack of proper nutrition is stunting growth, diminishing cognitive development and causing physical and emotional trauma among hundreds of thousands of young Venezuelans. As a result, doctors and other health experts argue, Venezuela faces a generation of young people who will never meet their full physical or mental potential.
Between 2013 and 2018, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, 13% of the country's children suffered from malnutrition. Caritas, in a recent study conducted in five Venezuelan states and the capital, Caracas, found that 16% of children under the age of five suffer from acute malnutrition and that nearly twice as many suffer from low growth rates for their age.
Although the United Nations and other agencies import some food and nutritional aid, it isn't enough for Venezuela's needs and the assistance doesn't always get where it is most required. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has raised just a third of the $222.7 million it sought for Venezuela for the second half of 2019, according to official U.N. data.
""A population suffering from malnutrition implies we are going to have adults with less physical and intellectual potential,"" said Raquel Mendoza, a nutritionist at Mapani, an aid group in Barquisimeto that helps poor families diagnose and treat malnourished children. ""We're going to see a regression in the development of the country because human resources are diminished.""
Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for government communications including those of the Health Ministry, didn't respond to requests for comment.
The ministry's 2016 annual report, the last one it published, celebrated advances in nutrition since the 1980s and said child malnutrition ""has stopped being a public health problem.""
For those without enough to eat, the problem is very real.
Rosa Rojas, a 32-year-old widow and mother of six, relies on rice and other carbohydrates to keep her kids fed. Rare is the day they get three full meals. ""We just eat twice,"" she said.
Gregoria Hernandez, a 23-year-old homemaker, recently hospitalized two young sons, Pastor and Josue Suarez, because they were malnourished. Shortly after their release, Sonia, her 7-month-old daughter, needed similar medical help.
""I feel like the worst of mothers,"" Hernandez told Reuters. ""I don't have a way to help them, to give them what they need.""
Sometimes, families are torn between competing needs.
Deina Alvarez, a 6-year-old student and aspiring gymnast, is underweight and receiving nutritional supplements from a local charity. Although her parents both work, they don't earn enough to fill a grocery cart and buy the medicines they both need as epileptics.
""Either we pay for medicine or we pay for food,"" said Diana Rodriguez, Deina's mother."

The killing of 27-year-old investigative reporter Jan Kuciak and is fiancee triggered mass protests and the resignation of a prime minister, buffeting the central European country's political and justice system.
The police inquiry has led to several other resignations of senior officials because of their past contact with prominent businessman Marian Kocner, who was a subject of Kuciak's reporting and has been charged with ordering his murder.
The trial opens on Thursday with Kocner and three others charged over the killing. Kocner has denied having anything to do with Kuciak's killing. A few months before, Kuciak told police that Kocner had threatened to start collecting information on him and his family. Police pressed no charges.
Kocner and two other have pleaded not guilty while one of the defendants has confessed, according to Slovak public television RTVS.
Separately, police brought charges on Wednesday against former general prosecutor Dobroslav Trnka for alleged abuse of power in dealings with Kochner, news websites Aktuality.sk and Dennikn.sk both reported.
A police statement, in which the suspect was identified only as D.T., said he was believed to have received and kept a recording from a decade-old secret service operation that looked into illicit links between politicians and businessmen, with the aim of gaining financially from the recorded material.
The statement said that the suspect received the recording from another man identified as M.K. - which Slovak media said referred to Kocner. Trnka, who has not been detained, declined to comment for Dennikn.sk when contacted.
Prosecutors said in August they had extracted tens of thousands of messages from Kocner's phone containing communication with ""representatives of state bodies and the justice system""."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The parents of Otto Warmbier, an American student who died after 17 months in a North Korean prison, hailed on Wednesday new congressional legislation passed in their son's name that calls for further sanctions on Pyongyang.
Flanked by four Democratic and Republican senators, Fred and Cindy Warmbier commended a provision of the broader National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, for applying pressure on North Korea to change its behavior.
Fred Warmbier told reporters the bill was ""very important to our efforts because it gives us more tools to force the North Koreans to engage on some level.""
The event on Capitol Hill came at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang as denuclearization talks begun with a summit last year between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have stalled.
North Korea has conducted a series of weapons tests and resumed personal insults against Trump, with Pyongyang warning it could take an unspecified ""new path"" if Washington fails to soften its stance before the end of the year.
Otto Warmbier, 22, died on June 19, 2017, shortly after he was flown home to Ohio in a coma after being held by North Korea for 17 months.
""I am still traumatized by what North Korea did to our family and certainly what they did to our son,"" Fred Warmbier said.
The NDAA, a broad defense spending bill passed on Tuesday and awaiting Trump's signature, urges a sweeping approach by the Trump administration to curb North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions and Enforcement Act calls for mandatory sanctions on North Korean imports and exports of textiles and coal and other minerals, as well as some petroleum products and crude oil, along with additional sanctions on banks that deal with North Korea.
""My message is to North Korea, like it always is: People matter. Otto matters. We're never going to let you forget our son,"" said Cindy Warmbier. She urged Trump, however, not to ""make a bad deal"" with North Korea."

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - As protests rage across Indian universities against a new citizenship law, students have taken to social media to wage battle online and teach people how to organize demonstrations.
Instagram is popular with some because it can be used to share pictures and video, while its settings allow protection against the online harassment that users can suffer on other platforms. 
""I don't like Twitter because each time I open it I see so much hate,"" said Abdul Rehman, 22, an engineering student at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University.
""There is no way to control who is viewing or sharing my pictures or videos on WhatsApp and most of my audience is not on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)."" 
Tens of thousands of Indians have protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), with students at the forefront. 
Approved by India's president last week, the law paves the way for minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to get Indian citizenship, but critics say it is biased against Muslims.
One protest on Sunday culminated in police storming the Jamia Millia Islamia University, leaving some 200 injured.
Current and former students have taken to Instagram, a photo and video sharing platform known for lifestyle content, to express their disapproval.
""We millennials are always active on Instagram,"" said Islam Mirza, who completed a masters in business administration at Jamia earlier this year. ""Whether it is to call off the protest, whether it is to organize the protests, whether it is to instruct students what to do or what not to do to help keep the protests peaceful, we use Instagram as a messenger.""
Many also use the platform to educate others about what they see as potential concerns with the new legislation.
While Facebook and its messenger WhatsApp are also being used to drive conversations about the CAA and protests, over half a dozen students from Jamia said Instagram was their preferred choice of social media.
AVOIDING HATE
Privacy settings on Instagram offer an escape from trolling or online harassment on platforms such as Twitter, said Torsha Sarkar, a policy officer at the Center for Internet and Society in Bengaluru.
The active presence of film, music and fashion celebrities on Instagram also makes it an appealing platform for young users to post pictures and videos for all to see, unlike Facebook or WhatsApp where conversations are largely private or among a user's close social circle.
It's not all one-way traffic though. Many are using social media to support the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Chinese firm ByteDance's TikTok, which allows users to create and share short videos with special effects, is also being used to voice opposition to the citizenship law.
A video posted by user @monuqureshi142 shows two women, one dressed in a white jumper and blue jeans, the other in a burqa, shouting slogans to a cheering crowd of hundreds outside Jamia University's main gate.
The soundtrack is dubbed over by a male voice rapping in Hindi.

""They malign us when we speak of our rights, the government and police feign ignorance from it all ... Unite, listen Muslims now all of you unite.""

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Chanting ""Independence"" and ""Free political prisoners"", several thousand Catalan protesters gathered near Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium on Wednesday hours before the local side was to face rivals Real Madrid in Spain's most high-profile match.
Despite a heavy police presence, some of them blocked a major avenue near the stadium, disrupting traffic. 
The La Liga game, known as ""El Clasico,"" had initially been scheduled to occur two months ago. However, it was postponed on security concerns due to unrest in the wealthy northeastern region after Spain's Supreme Court in October sentenced nine Catalan separatist leaders to up to 13 years in prison.
Wednesday's protest was called by secretive Catalan protest group Democratic Tsunami, which says it favors peaceful civic disobedience and whose main goals are to get Spain to negotiate on Catalonia's right to self-determination and to achieve freedom for the jailed separatists.
Many protesters carried banners that read ""Spain, sit and talk"" and the organization said on Twitter it would distribute 100,000 of those banners to the people attending the game. It also told them to bring inflatable balls and to write on them a ""message for the world"".
Democratic Tsunami, which organized mass protests at Barcelona's airport in October and blocked a major highway, said it does not wish to blockade or suspend the match.
Authorities have assembled a 3,000-strong force of public and private security officers to guarantee the match will not be disrupted, but declined to say how that compared to other ""El Clasico"" games. 
The Spanish central government has sent around 500 additional anti-riot police to Barcelona, who would only intervene if the Catalan police asks for their help, said a national police spokesman. 
Protesting in front of a hotel near the stadium where both teams were resting, pro-independence voter Marta Canaves, 53, said that the venue was a ""great place to make visible to the rest of the world"" the situation in Catalonia.

""We want to be heard and to vote,"" added her friend Emma Castells, 55, referring to separatist demands to hold a referendum on independence.

Vox, which surged to become Spain's third-largest party after winning 52 parliamentary seats in November's general election, campaigned on a fiercely nationalist platform that includes Gibraltar's return to Spanish control.
Gibraltar's government accused the party of publishing a series of statements that disparaged residents and which were ""designed to create an atmosphere of hatred among Spaniards toward Gibraltarians,"" Chief Minister Fabian Picardo told Gibraltar's parliament.
Filed in Spain, the complaints stemmed from statements and social media posts in which the Vox leaders referred to the territory as a ""leech,"" a ""parasite"" and a ""den of money launderers,"" local newspaper Gibraltar Chronicle reported.
""These are the sorts of practices that were employed in the 1930s in Germany by the National Socialists of Hitler in whipping up aggression against the Jewish people,"" Picardo told parliament on Wednesday. ""These are the sorts of practices we have seen in the Balkans at the time of ethnic cleansing.""
Vox did not immediately return a request for comment.
The government said it had also petitioned Spanish prosecutors to investigate an online group known as Gibraltar: Espanol, which it described as an ""echo chamber for anti-Gibraltar propaganda of Vox.""
The government added that it would raise its concerns with the social media platforms that host the group. 
""The Government will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the promulgators of anti-Gibraltarian hate are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" it added. 
With a population of around 30,000 people and a land area of nearly 7 square kilometres, the rocky peninsula at the mouth of the Mediterranean has been a point of contention between Spain and Britain for centuries.

Spain ceded the port to Britain in 1713 after a war, but continues to claim sovereignty over it.

Boko Haram has been fighting for a decade to carve out an Islamist caliphate in northeast Nigeria and has carried out regular raids over loosely guarded borders into neighboring Chad, Niger and Cameroon.
The latest attack struck a camp of fishermen near the village of Kaiga on Lake Chad, which has been plagued by the militants since 2009.
""The assailants arrived in the night and attacked the fishermen,"" official Dimoya Souapebe told Reuters. Thirteen people are missing in addition to the 14 killed, he said.
In March, Boko Haram militants killed at least 23 Chadian soldiers in an overnight raid, one of the deadliest such attacks inside Chad by the insurgents.
Chadian soldiers are part of a U.S.-trained West African task force deployed to counter Boko Haram. The violence over the past decade has killed more than 30,000 people and forced about 2 million to leave their homes."

ROME (Reuters) - A special tribunal has recommended that former Italian interior minister and far-right League party leader Matteo Salvini face trial for holding scores of migrants on board a coastguard ship docked in a port in Sicily in July.
In a court document seen by Reuters, Sicilian magistrates ask parliament for authorization to continue their investigation into Salvini for alleged kidnapping, saying he abused his powers and ""deprived 131 migrants of personal liberty"".
In July Salvini, then interior minister, ordered the migrants, including children, remain on board the Italian coastguard ship Gregoretti until other European countries agreed to take most of them in.
""Investigated because I defended the security, the borders and the dignity of my country, unbelievable,"" the anti-migrant leader said in a statement. He called the investigation ""shameful"".
During his 14 months at the interior ministry, Salvini staked his credibility on a pledge to halt migrant flows, blocking Italian ports to rescue ships and threatening the charities operating them with fines.
The investigation echoes another case earlier this year.
In February, when the League was in government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, parliament rejected a magistrates' request to pursue a kidnapping probe into Salvini for refusing permission to disembark for some 150 migrants on a coastguard ship stranded off Sicily.
On that occasion the 5-Star, which had always criticized the practice of halting judicial proceedings against lawmakers, rescued Salvini and blocked the investigation after weeks of tension within the government.
But things have now changed. The League walked out of government in August and 5-Star have formed a new coalition with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which strongly opposes Salvini's hard line against migrants.
The PD and other minor government parties are expected to vote to grant the authorization. It is unclear how 5-Star would vote this time.
The case will be examined by a 23-member upper house Senate committee. The timetable for its hearings has not yet been set."

VALLETTA (Reuters) - The former chief of staff to Malta's prime minister denied on Wednesday leaking information about an investigation into the killing of an anti-corruption reporter to the man accused of masterminding her murder.
The ex-aide, Keith Schembri, also denied writing a letter to the suspected mastermind, Yorgen Fenech, which instructed him what to tell police following Fenech's arrest over Daphne Caruana Galizia's death in a car bombing in October 2017.
Fenech, a multi-millionaire entrepreneur, was arrested last month as he tried to leave Malta on his yacht. He has been accused of complicity in the killing, which shone a spotlight on corruption in the European Union's smallest country.
Fenech denies the charge. He has also implicated Schembri in the murder and asked for lead investigator Keith Arnaud to be taken off the case, saying Arnaud and Schembri are close.
Appearing as a witness at a court hearing into Fenech's complaint against Arnaud, Schembri said he had attended briefings which the police and security service gave Prime Minister Joseph Muscat about the murder.
He said he and Fenech were friends, but denied leaking information about the briefings to the businessman and said he had not told him his phone calls were being monitored by the security service.
""We only discussed what was reported in the media,"" Schembri, who denies Fenech's accusations that he has links to corruption and the self-confessed middleman in the murder, told the judge.
He said he had spoken to Fenech by phone for 20 minutes shortly before the businessman tried to leave Malta, but denied he had tried to help him escape.
Schembri had been held under arrest by police for questioning but was released late last month. He quit as Muscat's chief of staff after Fenech's accusations against him.
Schembri said he had twice met self-confessed middleman Melvin Theuma in the government headquarters but that the meetings were not related to the Caruana Galizia murder.
The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Jan. 14. Separately, three men are awaiting trial for setting off the bomb."

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's economic crisis is forcing families to pull tens of thousands of children out of the private schools that educate most pupils in the country, and into a long-neglected state education system that is already struggling to cope.
Unlike in many countries where private schools are often mainly for the wealthy, Lebanon relies on them to educate two thirds of pupils, with working class families scrimping to afford hundreds of dollars a month in fees.
Those who cannot afford it end up in an under-funded state system that educates 300,000 Lebanese pupils and has put on a second shift in recent years for 200,000 Syrian refugees.
With the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war having struck this year, 36,000 extra pupils have moved from private school into the state system, Education Minister Akram Chehayeb told Reuters. He expects still more children to follow, with no additional funds or staff to teach them.
""The pressure will increase on public schools,"" he said. ""Due to the 2019 budget, we can't hire new teachers, while 1,400 retire every year.""
Eid Ramadan, a hairstylist, struggled to find more than $6,000 a year in total for private school for his two sons. This year he was forced to pull his younger son out.
""My kids are thankfully smart and understanding,"" he said. ""They know we were doing the impossible to keep them (in private school). But we’ve reached a point where we couldn’t. We’ve hit a brick wall.""
The country's long-brewing economic troubles have spiraled into a financial crisis since October, when protests erupted against the ruling elite. Businesses have closed, workers have been laid off and wages cut. Banks are restricting access to cash and the Lebanese pound has slumped.
""The majority of the people can no longer pay thousands of dollars for tuition every year,"" said Ramadan.
Salwa Hemadeh moved her 14-year-old daughter into a state school this year, having previously moved her three sons out of private education as the economy worsened and her husband's job as a plasterer brought in less income.
""She didn’t adapt well to the new school because it was so big and there were so many students. But we laid out the truth: either you get your education at this public school or you get no education,"" she said."

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Rio de Janeiro state prosecutors on Wednesday raided properties of the former staff of Flavio Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, and relatives of the president's ex-wife, according to prosecutors and two sources familiar with the matter.
The current investigation is an offshoot from an earlier probe looking into suspicious payments to staff from when Senator Flavio Bolsonaro was a Rio state lawmaker. The original investigation was frozen by Brazil's Supreme Court earlier this year, but later unshelved.
Flavio Bolsonaro has insisted he is innocent of any crimes. However, the investigation has been a stain on him and his father's young administration, which came to power vowing to kick out years of political graft in Brazil. 
Investigators carried out 24 raids as part of the probe into Fabrício Queiroz, Flavio Bolsonaro's former employee at the state legislature who is being investigated on suspicion of helping skim phantom employees' salaries, the Rio state prosecutor's office said in a statement.
It added that due to the secrecy of the case, it could not reveal any more details.
They also carried out search warrants at properties linked to the ex-wife of President Jair Bolsonaro, Ana Cristina Valle, the sources said. 
In a statement, Queiroz said he was surprised by the raids, but was unconcerned by them, ""since he has always cooperated with the investigations."" 

A spokesman for Flavio Bolsonaro had no immediate comment. Reuters was unable to reach Ana Cristina Valle.

At a regular government news briefing Lopez Obrador was asked if Mexico would probe Calderon following the arrest of ex-security minister Genaro Garcia Luna last week, or whether he would leave the matter in the hands of the United States.
""There won't be an investigation because it would create the perception we're doing it for political purposes,"" said Lopez Obrador, a leftist who claimed he was robbed of the presidency in 2006 after a narrow loss to the conservative Calderon.
The president said the office of Mexico's attorney general would cooperate with U.S. authorities in the investigations around Garcia Luna, who this week waived his right to a detention hearing in a Dallas federal court.
""And if they decide to open a case, it's a decision of that independent authority,"" Lopez Obrador said, apparently referring to Calderon, who was president until 2012.
Lopez Obrador said he believed it was better to look to the future rather than rake through the past. But he repeated that if the Mexican public demanded via referendum to go after ex-presidents, his administration would heed the call.
Garcia Luna, who was Calderon's minister for public security from 2006 to 2012, has been accused of accepting millions of dollars in bribes from the Sinaloa Cartel once headed by convicted kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman."

YANGON AND DHAKA (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Wednesday thanked supporters who staged large rallies on her behalf as she defended the country against genocide charges at The Hague, speaking to the nation for the first time since she returned on Sunday.
Gambia accused Myanmar of violating the 1948 Genocide Convention over a military campaign that drove more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar to Bangladesh. It has asked the International Court of Justice to order “provisional measures” to prevent more harm.
""The support of our people, given generously and unquestioningly ... was a great source of strength to us when we presented our case at the ICJ,"" Nobel laureate Suu Kyi said in a televised address screened by the state broadcaster.
Suu Kyi led a team to the Netherlands for three days of hearings last week, during which she denied genocide and argued the U.N. court should not have jurisdiction.
""Every country passes through difficult times and Myanmar is no exception. Such trials provide us with an opportunity to assess our strengths and weaknesses, to reinforce one and rectify the other,"" she said.
""The challenge we faced at the court actually emerged due not only to the crisis that happened in recent years, but also missed opportunities to handle fairly and constructively social issues, politics, and the economy, over many decades.""
Suu Kyi was long feted in the West as a champion of human rights and democracy and was a high-profile political prisoner during 15 years of house arrest for her opposition to Myanmar’s then ruling military junta.
She came to power after a landslide election victory in 2015 that ended half a century of army rule.
But her stance on the Rohingya issue has seen her stripped of many awards, calls for the Nobel committee to revoke her peace prize and strong criticism from former celebrity supporters and other organizations.
At home however, Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmar’s founding father Aung San, is still revered by many.
The proceedings in The Hague galvanized supporters, who staged rallies across the country chanting “Stand with Suu Kyi” and waving flags.
CAMP VISIT
A delegation of Myanmar officials visited the sprawling Bangladeshi refugee camps on Wednesday, where they spoke to several dozen Rohingya in an effort to kickstart a process to repatriate them.
Myanmar says it has been ready to accept back the refugees since January last year and has built camps near the border to receive them.
Rohingya leaders say they want Myanmar to recognize them as an ethnic group with the right to Myanmar citizenship before they return.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who remain inside Myanmar are mostly denied citizenship and live in conditions Amnesty International has likened to apartheid, confined to camps and villages and unable to travel freely.
Myanmar does not consider the Rohingya a native ethnic group. Many in the Buddhist-majority country call the Rohingya “Bengalis”, suggesting they belong in Bangladesh.
Rohingya leader Abdur Rahim, who joined the talks on Wednesday, said no progress had been made.

“We are very upset. It’s going to be another failed negotiation. They are saying the same old thing. There is nothing new,” he told Reuters by phone.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 09:49AM ET</span>",Slovak court suspends bill for Europe's longest pre-election poll blackout,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Slovakia's Constitutional Court on Wednesday suspended a law putting in place one of the world's longest bans on publishing opinion polls before elections, preventing the bill from taking effect before a parliamentary vote in February.
Opposition and critics have viewed the ruling party-backed bill, approved last month, as an attempt to sideline political newcomers before the European Union country's Feb. 29 election.
The change would have extended the blackout on publishing polls on voting intentions to 50 days, from the already lengthy 14 days, which would have been the third-longest ban of its kind in the world, according to the Slovak Academy of Sciences.
President Zuzana Caputova had filed the motion against the law in which she argued it violated the right to information and that it limited political competition.
Opposition critics said the measure was aimed at disadvantaging challengers from new parties that could benefit from late shifts in support. It did not ban procuring polls but barred publication of any results.
The court ruling returns the black-out period to 14 days, pending further court deliberations that will take place at an unspecified future date.
The law had won backing from the ruling leftist Smer party, junior coalition partner Slovak National Party (SNS) and the opposition far-right People's Party-Our Slovakia.
Its authors said the bill aimed to protect voters from disinformation so they could base their decisions on the parties' program and actions.
Caputova, an activist lawyer and political newcomer herself, defeated Smer's candidate in a presidential run-off in March after a late surge in support.
Smer leads polls, but has seen support slip since last year's murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancée triggered mass protests over corruption and ousted prime minister Robert Fico, who had dominated the euro zone country's politics for a decade.
Some polls have shown a wide coalition of opposition parties could edge Smer from power in the election."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - What Communist Party rulers in China fear the most is Taiwan's democracy, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday, describing Beijing as a threat seeking every day to undermine Taiwan and criticizing her main opponent for being too close to China.
Tsai, who faces re-election on Jan. 11, has repeatedly warned of the danger posed to self-ruled Taiwan by China, which claims the island as its own territory to be brought under Beijing's control by force if needed, a message Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated in January.
Taipei-Beijing relations have soured since Tsai won office in 2016, with China believing she is moving toward a formal declaration of independence for the island. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent nation, called the Republic of China, Taiwan's official name.
In a live televised pre-election policy address by the three presidential candidates - a debate comes later this month - Tsai accused the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, of cosying up to China, pointing to presidential hopeful Han Kuo-yu's meeting with senior Chinese officials earlier this year.
""What China fears the most is the unity of Taiwan's people. What China fears the most is Taiwan's democracy,"" Tsai said. ""We must be aware that China is infiltrating and dividing Taiwan's society in an all-round way.""
Referring to the anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, Tsai said that Taiwan cannot accept ""one country, two systems"", the method Beijing uses to rule the city which is meant to grant a high degree of autonomy and which China hopes eventually to apply to Taiwan.
""The situation in Hong Kong makes it very clear to all of us that democracy and authoritarianism are in conflict. The two systems cannot coexist in one country,"" she said.
Han, trailing in the polls, said Tsai was being unfair trying to brand him as selling out Taiwan for China, and pointed out she and some of her own senior colleagues had themselves been previously to China to meet top Chinese officials.
""Who dares to say that your team does not love Taiwan?"" Han, currently the mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung, said, adding his trip was to try to promote Taiwan agricultural exports to China and attract Chinese tourists.
""Why can you go and it's not selling out Taiwan's sovereignty, but when I go it is?"" he added.
Tsai's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party advocates Taiwan's formal independence, while the Kuomintang, which ruled China before fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 at the end of a civil war with the Communists, advocates close ties with China."

That timeline is a year earlier than the government's original estimate and Widodo said he had also ordered the construction of basic infrastructure to begin next year.
The president announced in August the government intended to move the administrative capital to East Kalimantan province, on Borneo, by 2024 to relieve the heavy burden on the current capital Jakarta due to overcrowding and pollution.
He visited the site of the new city for two days from Tuesday, observing from a helicopter the spot where a new state palace was due to be built, according to government statements.
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Wednesday, Widodo said the government would form a new agency to oversee the relocation project next month and it would then officially submit a bill backing the move to parliament.
""The whole process, including the grand design, I hope can be completed in six months. Then, we can do some land clearing and basic infrastructure construction,"" he wrote on the posting, next to a photograph of himself standing on some barren, scrubby land atop a hill.
While some Indonesians have been excited by the plans to move the capital, some green groups have criticized the project for its potential environmental impact and others have questioned how Indonesia will raise the funds to build it.
Some non-governmental organizations have also said that a number of national and local politicians with land interests in the area could stand to benefit from the megaproject.
The 256,000 hectare site of the capital is on highland overseeing a bay, Widodo said, noting government offices would begin to be built next year and should be ready by 2023.
On Tuesday, Widodo expressed hope that the new capital could be the ""next Silicon Valley"" due to a cluster of research and innovation facilities envisaged for the area.
He also inaugurated the first toll road in the Kalimantan area.
Jakarta, the current capital of the world's fourth most populous country, on the island of Java, is now home to 10 million people and is sinking due to over-extraction of ground water, as well as being prone to floods and traffic gridlock."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States failed on Wednesday to agree on Seoul's contribution toward hosting some 28,500 U.S. troops, but the U.S. side hinted after the two days of talks ended that it will no longer stick to its $5 billion demand.
No deal by Dec. 31, when the current agreement expires, may result in a repeat of last year when the two countries missed a year-end deadline but reached a retroactive deal in the new year. The two sides next meet in January in the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused South Korea of being a rich nation that is profiting off the U.S. military forces, which are stationed in the country as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War and continued threats from North Korea.
South Korean lawmakers have said Washington is seeking up to $5 billion a year to support the troops - more than five times the amount Seoul agreed to pay this year.
But the United States' chief negotiator James DeHart told reporters after Wednesday's meeting that ""($5 billion) is not a number we are currently focused on in the negotiations ... when we reach an agreement, we will be in a position to explain that number and how we got there.""
""We have been listening, we have been adjusting and we have been compromising, and we know that agreement ... when we reach the agreement, the figure will be different from our initial proposal and probably different from what we've heard from the Korean side so far,"" he added.
Some U.S. and Korean experts say no deal could throw the future of the U.S. presence in South Korea into doubt.
Asked whether there is a deadline for further discussions, DeHart said he didn't have a single date in mind but added that both sides ""will be working very energetically in the New Year and January to try to get it done.""
South Korea's Foreign Ministry said its negotiating team led by Jeong Eun-bo emphasized the need for ""fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable agreements,"" that will strengthen the alliance.
The dispute is a rare public sign of discord in the alliance that has for 70 years formed a buffer against North Korean aggression. The two Koreas remain technically at war, after the Korean War ended in a truce but not a peace treaty.
There have been public protests in South Korea against the U.S. calls for more money, and a survey by the Chicago Council of Global Affairs found that only 4% of South Korean respondents said Seoul should meet Trump's demands. On the other hand, 74% said they supported the troops' long-term presence.
If no deal is reached, the most immediate effect may be on thousands of South Korean civilians who work for the U.S. military and could be placed on unpaid leave.
As part of his 'America First"" policy, Trump has demanded that many U.S. allies, including NATO members and Japan, pay more toward defense."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The daughter of jailed Uighur rights activist Ilham Tohti accepted a European Parliament prize on his behalf on Wednesday, urging lawmakers in an address not to be ""complicit in the Chinese persecution of the Uighur people"".
China has come under increasing international scrutiny for cracking down on the Muslim Uighur minority in its northwesterly Xinjiang region.
Tohti, an economist, was jailed for life in China in 2014 on separatism charges that were widely denounced in Western capitals.
His daughter, Jewher Ilham, urged politicians, academics and students on Wednesday to protest against the treatment of the Uighurs as she accepted her father's Sakharov Prize for defense of human rights at the parliament in Strasbourg.
Independent German researcher Adrian Zenz, an expert on China's ethnic policies, estimated in March that 1.5 million Uighurs and other Muslims had been or were being detained in so-called re-education centers in Xinjiang.
After Tohti's prize was announced in October, China said he was ""a criminal who was sentenced in accordance with the law by a Chinese court"", and urged that ""all sides respect China's internal affairs and judicial sovereignty and not inflate the arrogance of terrorists"".
China has said Xinjiang is under threat from Islamist militants and separatists. It denies mistreatment or mass internment, saying it is simply seeking to end extremism and violence through education.
The 50,000 euro ($55,000) Sakharov Prize has been awarded annually since 1988 to individuals and organizations defending human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Two weeks ago, the U.S. House of Representatives gave initial approval to a bill that would require the U.S. administration to toughen its response to China's crackdown.
In Strasbourg, European Parliament president David Sassoli said: ""By awarding this prize, we strongly urge the Chinese government to release Tohti and we call for the respect of minority rights in China."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Queen Elizabeth will make a speech in parliament on Thursday, announcing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's legislative agenda after his election win last week.
WHAT IS A QUEEN'S SPEECH?
It is used by the government to lay out plans for the coming year and typically lists the main priorities and legislation the government aims to pass.
Queen Elizabeth reads the speech, written by the government. It is the highlight of a ceremony, known as the state opening of parliament, which marks the beginning of a new parliamentary session.
DIDN'T WE JUST HAVE ONE OF THESE?
Yes. The last Queen's Speech was on Oct. 14, when the monarch set out Johnson's priority to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 as well as domestic-focused legislation.
But, parliament forced Johnson's minority government to delay Britain's exit from the EU, so the prime minister called an election and on Dec. 12 won an 80-seat majority.
This means a new session of parliament and Queen's Speech. Thursday's speech will be a slimmed down occasion and will not have some of the ceremonial elements included in October.
WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN IT?
The speech is expected to include many of the bills announced in October and a few new objectives, possible thanks to Johnson's stronger position in parliament.
The priority will again be legislation to implement Johnson's Brexit deal. He needs this Withdrawal Agreement Bill passed by the end of January. His new majority means there is little obstacle to doing so.
Beyond that, it will include previously-announced bills to implement a new immigration system and to set out post-Brexit plans for fisheries, agriculture and trade.
WHAT'S NEW?
The legislative agenda will incorporate details of policies fleshed out or newly announced during the election campaign, including measures to cement funding pledges for the National Health Service and more detail on a points-based immigration system. A bill on post-Brexit workers' rights is also expected.
DOES THIS SPEECH REALLY MATTER?
Yes, and no.
The speech will signal Johnson's policy agenda beyond Brexit and how he plans to use his parliamentary majority to reshape the country at a critical juncture.
But, the speech itself is light on detail and many of the policy papers announced alongside it will be familiar from October, and the election campaign.
The speech does not oblige the government to pass all of the bills mentioned into law, nor does it prevent them from introducing other legislation at a later date."

LONDON (Reuters) - Trailblazing feminist judge Brenda Hale used her valedictory speech as president of the UK Supreme Court on Wednesday to call for the judiciary to remain free from U.S.-style political influence and to poke fun at enduring sexism in the legal world.
State-school educated Hale, 74, rose to the top of a profession dominated by men who went to elite private schools. She was the first female member of the Law Lords, the precursor to the Supreme Court, and subsequently the first female justice of the Supreme Court and its first woman president.
She grabbed the international spotlight in September when she delivered a devastating ruling against Prime Minister Boris Johnson, annulling his decision to suspend parliament at a crucial moment in the Brexit process.
Some irate Brexit supporters accused the Supreme Court of meddling in politics, although Hale had been at pains to make clear that the court was making no judgment on the merits of Brexit and merely addressing legal issues.
In a short speech at a ceremony to mark her retirement from the court, Hale stressed the apolitical nature of the court.
""We do not know one another's political opinions, although occasionally we may have a good guess, and long may that remain so,"" she said. 
""Judges have not been appointed for party political reasons in this country since at least the Second World War. We do not want to turn into the Supreme Court of the United States, whether in powers or in process of appointment,"" she added.
After his defeat in the Supreme Court, Johnson failed to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31, as he had repeatedly promised to do. However, he won a commanding majority in parliament in a general election last week, and is now poised to lead Britain out of the European Union by Jan. 31.
His election manifesto pledged in vague terms that after Brexit, his government would look at the relationship between the government, parliament and the courts, prompting speculation that he would try to curb Supreme Court powers.
If he does, he is likely to encounter stiff resistance from Hale's successor, Robert Reed, who in his speech at the ceremony praised her handling of the case on the suspension of parliament as her greatest achievement as Supreme Court president.
SPIDER BROOCH
Reed said that the large spider brooch she wore to deliver that ruling, which attracted widespread comment, had become ""a symbol of swashbuckling womanhood"".
An habitual wearer of insect-themed brooches, Hale opted on Wednesday for what appeared to be a large winged beetle. Several women lawyers attending the event wore spider brooches in homage to Hale, who they described as a role model.
Known for her feminist views, Hale used the occasion to make light-hearted but pointed remarks about the attitudes of some of the men in her professional life.
""Some stereotyping lived on,"" she said. ""Why else was I put in charge of art and interiors when we moved into this building while others were in charge of the more serious business of funding, staffing and security?""
She also upbraided some of the lawyers who have appeared before the court over the years for addressing her and her fellow justices as ""My Lords"".

""Sadly there are still counsel in this court who fail to realize they are addressing a mixed bench,"" she said.

Local broadcaster Thai PBS reported that a 14-year-old student, whose name was not given, confessed to police that he had smuggled his father's gun into school to get back at a classmate who was constantly bullying him.
He pulled out the gun and shot the classmate outside a classroom at the school, Thai PBS said.

Turkey has said the zone will let refugees camped out in its territory return safely to their own country, and help secure its border with Syria. But Western allies have criticized the Turkish military incursion in October which saw Ankara seize a large part of Syria's north from Kurdish YPG militia.
""Not even the countries we regard as the most powerful and respected have come out yet in response to our call on the safe zone and said 'we're in',"" Erdogan was quoted as telling reporters in Geneva, where he attended the Global Forum on Refugees on Tuesday.
More than 600,000 refugees would voluntarily join around 371,000 already in the ""peace zone"", he said on Tuesday.
""If we succeed in this, it will go down in history as an example. They will say, 'Turkey established this city or cities for refugees'. This is really important for us. Our project is great,"" he said.
Erdogan said Turkey had spent $40 billion hosting some 3.7 million Syrian refugees. He has repeatedly accused the European Union of failing to deliver about half the nearly 6 billion euros ($6.61 billion) it had promised to support the broader refugee work.

Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies launched its third offensive in northern Syria in October, targeting the U.S.-allied YPG militia, which had spearheaded the fight against Islamic State but which Ankara regards as a terrorist group.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 06:52AM ET</span>",Ex-PM Blair tells Britain's Labour: change or you will disappear,"By Kylie MacLellan and Joanna Taylor
LONDON (Reuters) - Former British prime minister Tony Blair, Labour's most successful leader, on Wednesday urged the party to rebuild from electoral humiliation by rejecting the ""protest movement with cult trimmings"" created by outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn. 
Thursday's defeat was Labour's worst since 1935, and a battle for control is now under way between moderates and Corbyn's hard-left allies.
Blair won three elections for Labour by hauling it toward a business-friendly centrist platform, and was premier from 1997 to 2007. But he lost favor in part by sending British forces to back U.S. president George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Corbyn's supporters say Blair both betrayed the working classes and undermined faith in politicians, and ""Blairism"" remains badly tarnished, both inside and outside Labour.
After Prime Minister Boris Johnson's party swept up long-standing Labour constituencies in working-class areas of northern and central England, including Blair's old seat, the ex-premier said few would now bet against another decade of Conservative rule.
""The takeover of the Labour Party by the far left turned it into a glorified protest movement with cult trimmings, utterly incapable of being a credible government,"" Blair said. ""The result has brought shame on us.""
Labour won just 203 seats, down 59, and saw its vote fall by 7.8 percentage points to 32.2%, while the Conservatives won 365 seats, up 47, on 43.6% of the vote. 
Corbyn is standing down in the new year and prominent Labour lawmakers including Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer are considering running to replace him as leader.
'MISGUIDED IDEOLOGY, TERMINAL INEPTITUDE' 
Blair said Labour must now ""renew itself as the serious, progressive, non-Conservative competitor for power in British politics, or retreat from such an ambition, in which case over time it will be replaced"".
He said Corbyn had personified ""an idea, a brand, of quasi-revolutionary socialism, mixing far-left economic policy with deep hostility to Western foreign policy"", and that voters had found his ""combination of misguided ideology and terminal ineptitude"" insulting.
""To win power we need self-discipline, not self-indulgence,"" he said.
Corbyn had promised a radical socialist program of higher public spending, sweeping nationalization and taxes on the wealthy.
Blair said this ""wish list"" would have caused chaos if implemented.
""Any fool can promise everything for free but the people weren't fooled,"" he said. ""They know life isn't like that.""
Blair also said that Corbyn's complicated and equivocal stance on leaving the EU - while Johnson endlessly promised to ""Get Brexit done"" - had displeased both opponents and advocates of Brexit. Always ambiguous on EU membership, Corbyn promised voters a second EU referendum, in which he would remain neutral.
""We pursued a path of almost comic indecision, alienated both sides of the debate,"" Blair said. 

""The absence of leadership on what was obviously the biggest question facing the country then reinforced all the other doubts about Jeremy Corbyn.""

315,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>",Indian court refuses to stop implementation of citizenship law,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court turned down a plea on Wednesday to stop the implementation of a new citizenship law based on religion that has set off violent protests in the country, but said it would hold hearings next month on the sweeping measure. 
The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) makes it easier for non-Muslims from the neighboring countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who settled in India prior to 2015 to gain Indian citizenship. 
Thousands of people have protested, saying the law is anti-Muslim and the latest in a series of measures by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government to marginalize the community.
""We want a stay order in the CAA case,"" said Kapil Sibal, a lawyer for petitioners who challenged the law in court, adding it was in conflict with parts of the Indian constitution guaranteeing equality to all.
Supreme Court Chief Justice S.A. Bobde refused requests to hold off the implementation of the law, which came into effect last week. The court will however hear petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the law on Jan. 22.
Modi's government says the law was intended to address the persecution of minorities such as Hindus, Sikhs and Christians in the Muslim-majority countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
Those groups, many of whom have been languishing in India for years without rights, will now get an automatic path to Indian nationality if they came from these three countries before 2015.
But protesters say the exclusion of Muslims shows a deep-seated bias against the community, which makes up 14 percent of India's population, the third largest Muslim population in the world. 
The new measure follows the revocation of the special status of the Muslim-majority Kashmir region, and a court ruling clearing the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a mosque razed by Hindu zealots.
On Wednesday, police fired shots in the air in a Muslim-dominated part of Delhi to push back thousands of demonstrators throwing stones and glass bottles demanding the law be withdrawn. 

More protests are planned for Wednesday in Delhi.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's top court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal against the death penalty by one of four men convicted of the gang-rape of a woman on a bus in New Delhi and her murder, saying it found no reason to review the sentence.
The four were convicted in 2013 of the rape, torture and murder of the 23-year-old physiotherapy student in New Delhi in 2012, an attack that triggered shockwaves across the world.
The woman died of her injuries in hospital in Singapore.
The case prompted India to enact tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases, but implementation has been poor and the attacks have shown no signs of let-up.
A woman is raped every 20 minutes in India on average, according to government data.
""It is still is very difficult for women to have cases registered with the police,"" said Bulbul Das, a women rights expert and lawyer based in New Delhi. ""The inquiry procedures are very poor. Very little is being done for women's safety in the first place.""
The victim in the 2012 case came from a lower-middle class family and worked in a call center while she studied.
Her mother told reporters outside the court that she welcomed the ruling and hoped all four men would be executed soon. 
""This is one step closer to justice,"" she said.
In another high-profile case that fueled public anger, a court on Monday found Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a lawmaker formerly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, guilty of raping a teenager in 2017. Sengar had pleaded not guilty, and his family said they plan to appeal.
India has been rocked by two other recent cases: the killing of a young woman in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh allegedly by two men she had accused of having raped her, and the murder of a 27-year-old vet in India’s IT hub of Hyderabad, who police said was abducted, raped and asphyxiated and her body set ablaze.
Last year, the court dismissed sentence review pleas filed by the three other defendants in the 2012 case. A fifth allegedly committed suicide in jail in 2013, and a sixth, a juvenile, was convicted and released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term in 2016.

A.P. Singh, the lawyer for the defendant whose appeal was dismissed on Wednesday, said he would appeal again. He has the option to file a mercy plea with the president.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 06:31AM ET</span>",Indonesia police question suspected Islamic militants arrested in Papua,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian anti-terrorism officers are interrogating eight suspected Islamic militants arrested in the province of Papua on suspicion that they were planning an attack, a police spokesman said on Wednesday.
The arrest was a ""pre-emptive strike"" by the anti-terrorism squad earlier this month in several locations in Papua, National Police spokesman Asep Adi Saputra said in Jakarta.
The suspects have been transferred to Jakarta for questioning, he said. They were suspected of having links to the Islamic State-inspired Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), which has carried out a series of attacks in Indonesia.Police said the arrests were made after officers had conduced surveillance of meetings between the suspects, as well as training and preparation for suspected attacks.
""Their target and their plan is currently being investigated,"" Saputra said.
Separately, Papua police chief Paulus Waterpauw said on Tuesday the suspects were part of JAD networks on the Indonesian island of Sumatra that had moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital of Papua.
He said the arrest prompted police in Papau to heighten security in the area, especially before the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
Indonesia is predominantly Muslim but some areas, particularly in the east, including Papua, have Christian majorities.
Papua has suffered a simmering conflict led by a mostly poorly armed and fractured separatist movement for decades, though not the type of sectarian or religious conflict in some other parts of Indonesia.
Two Indonesian soldiers were shot dead in Papua, ambushed by separatist rebels while transporting goods to a village in a remote area, a military spokesman said on Wednesday."

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Gunmen shot and killed two police officers escorting a polio vaccination team on Wednesday forcing a suspension of the immunization campaign in a district of northwest Pakistan, where the crippling disease is endemic.
Previous attacks have been inspired by religious hardliners spreading false rumors, and the latest ambush of a vaccination team comes at a time when the polio cases in Pakistan have jumped from 12 to over 100 in the last one year, making it only one of three countries in the world where the disease is endemic.
The gunmen opened fire at the officials when they were escorting the vaccination team in Lower Dir district, said police official Sultan Ghani. ""The polio campaign has been suspended after the incident in the area,"" he said.
Of the 104 total polio cases in Pakistan, 75 has been reported from the northwest Pakistan, a region plagued by Islamist militancy.
No one claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, though religious hardliners over the past year have raised a scare on social media that some children were being poisoned and dying from contaminated vaccines.
In the past, militants have called vaccination teams foreign agents, and peddled conspiracy theories that their campaigns were a Western ploy to sterilize Muslims.
Pakistan's government has tried to counter those falsehoods with public education campaigns, recruiting Muslim religious leaders to reassure people that the vaccine only protects their children.
The involvement of a Pakistani doctor in helping U.S. intelligence agents to locate the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden had fueled suspicion of the anti-polio campaign, though attacks on vaccination teams pre-dated the 2011 killing of the al Qaeda leader in the northwestern town of Abbottabad.
Afghanistan and Nigeria are the other countries where the polio virus, which can cause paralysis or death, remains endemic."

DOHA (Reuters) - Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Wednesday Mesut Ozil must ""accept the consequences"" of criticizing China's treatment of its Uighur Muslims, but he defended the star midfielder's right to express an opinion.
Ozil, a German Muslim of Turkish origin signed by Wenger in 2013, posted messages on Twitter and Instagram last week calling minority Uighurs ""warriors who resist persecution"".
China's foreign ministry said Ozil had been deceived by fake news as the country's Twitter-like Weibo platform erupted with angry messages, some calling for the London club to sack their highest-paid player.
Wenger told reporters in Doha he did not know if there would be a long-term impact for Ozil. 
""I don't think the situation is definite, that can change very quickly, and although I don't know the situation well overall, Ozil made a comment and after, when you make a comment about your individual opinion, you accept the consequences of it,"" Wenger said.
""First of all Mesut Ozil has freedom of speech like everyone else and he uses his notoriety to express his opinions, what is not necessarily shared by everybody but he has the right to do that,"" the Frenchman added.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came out in support of Ozil on Tuesday, saying Beijing could not hide rights violations. 
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs. But the United Nations and rights groups estimate up to two million mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims have been detained as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.
Arsenal was quick to distance itself from their midfielder's comments, posting a statement on Weibo saying it was his personal opinion.
Wenger said he did not want to get involved in the debate about the right balance between players' opinions and the commercial relationships big clubs, such as Arsenal, have internationally.
""I don't want to go into that dilemma, I think what is important is that Ozil has an individual responsibility, he doesn't carry the word of Arsenal Football Club. So what he says is about himself, not about Arsenal,"" Wenger added.

The National Basketball Association says it has incurred substantial financial losses in China since a Houston Rockets official tweeted his support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests in October.

BUSAN, South Korea (Reuters) - Hong Kong football fans booed as the Chinese national anthem was played on Wednesday before their team's clash with China in South Korea as the political turmoil that has gripped the former British colony spilled over to the sports world.
The Korea Football Association said it had taken steps to ensure there were no banners bearing political messages at the Busan Asiad Stadium, where nearly 200 Hong Kong fans chanted and banged drums to drown out a tiny pocket of Chinese supporters.
China won the game 2-0.
Hong Kong has been rocked by six months of sometimes violent demonstrations, with protesters angered by what they see as Beijing's stifling of freedoms despite a ""one country, two systems"" promise of autonomy when the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China rejects the suggestion it is interfering in Hong Kong, and blames Western countries for inciting the trouble.
Disrespecting the national anthem is a crime in China. Hong Kong has presented a bill that sets jail terms of up to three years for the same offense, a move critics say raises fresh fears over freedom of expression.
Hong Kong, designated the home side for Wednesday's match in the four-team tournament that also includes hosts South Korea and Japan, were dressed all in red and turned to face their bauhinia flag when the national anthem began.
The Chinese players, dressed in yellow, faced their flag and belted out the anthem as it was being played, while boos rang out from the Hong Kong fans.
After the game ended, the Hong Kong fans sang ""Glory to Hong Kong,"" a song that has become a rallying cry for democracy.
Television coverage of the match in Hong Kong did not show the anthem being played, instead cutting in as the players were shaking hands.
When Chinese player Ji Xiang scored the first goal in the ninth minute, the Hong Kong fans booed and shouted in English: ""Let's go Hong Kong, let's go!""
Chinese fans tried make themselves heard in the cavernous 50,000-seater stadium as Hong Kong supporters chanted: ""We are Hong Kong"" throughout the match.
University student Ben Wan, 21, said he flew in to watch the tournament and said the match had taken on a different edge due to the unrest back home in Hong Kong. 
Wan, who was wearing a black mask, said: ""I think the games against China are much more important than the previous because ... in Hong Kong there is political cleavage, it is becoming more and more serious.""
Chinese fan Zhang Hui said he flew in just for this game.
""This particular competition, we think it’s between two Chinese teams, one country two systems, go China!"" said the 37-year-old. 
Hong Kong fans also jeered the country's national anthem during a soccer World Cup qualifier against Iran in September.
""I’m a bit disappointed about the score because we lost but the team performance was I think was good,"" a man who gave his surname as So said. ""...I’ve quite enjoyed the match because we got many friends here.""

322,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 05:14AM ET</span>",Annus horribilis II? UK's Queen Elizabeth will reflect on another tough year,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - When Britain's Queen Elizabeth addresses her nation on Christmas Day it will mark the end of one of the most difficult years of her long reign.
Over the past 12 months, her husband got a police warning for his involvement in a car crash, her grandsons Princes William and Harry publicly fell out and her second son Prince Andrew got ever more entangled in the furor over his links to disgraced U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein.
""This is as bad as it gets for her,"" royal biographer Penny Junor told Reuters. 
Back in 1992, the queen described an ""annus horribilis"", wrecked by the collapse of three of her children's marriages - including Prince Charles' to Princess Diana - and the fire that severely damaged her Windsor Castle home.
""She obviously won't use that phrase again,"" said Junor, ""but I would suspect in some ways this (year) has been even worse.""
In January, Elizabeth's 98-year-old husband Prince Philip was involved in a car accident near the family's Sandringham estate in eastern England. He had to give up his driving license after police gave him a warning for driving without wearing a seat belt.
Grandson Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan faced increasingly hostile stories in the press, culminating in them taking legal action against a number of tabloids. Harry also said he and elder brother Prince William had fallen out, without giving details.
The queen herself was embroiled in political wrangling over Britain's exit from the European Union, with her suspension of parliament in September at the behest of Prime Minister Boris Johnson ruled unlawful by the country's top court.
But by far the greatest negativity was generated by the furor over Andrew's links to Epstein, and accusations the prince had had sex with a 17-year-old girl. 
An interview Andrew gave to the BBC in November denying that accusation and any other wrongdoing was cast by the British media as a disaster, leading to him stepping down from public duties. Still, the year may not have been a total catastrophe.
SURVIVAL
""Most people will look upon 2019 as not a particularly good year for the institution but the queen came out pretty well,"" said Dickie Arbiter, Elizabeth's press secretary from 1988 to 2000.
""The monarchy has evolved over 1,000 years. It has had all sorts of circumstances running against it, but it has survived. It survived 1992, it survived the abdication of (King Edward VIII in) 1936, it survived 2019.""
Some have gone as far as saying the family could eventually emerge even stronger - and that this year's traumas could lay the foundations of a new slimmed-down monarchy, a long-term aim of future king Prince Charles.  
The heir was key in the decision to have Andrew ""de-royaled"" and effectively fired from his job, said royal historian Robert Lacey.
""It's a tragedy in a way, but it is a plus to see Charles playing a positive role in events,"" added Lacey, the historical consultant to the hugely-popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) TV series ""The Crown"". ""After 20 years, Charles is finally getting his way."" 
To mark her 50th year as queen in 2002, more than a dozen members of the royal family appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace. A decade later it was just her, her husband, Prince Charles and wife Camilla, together with William, his wife Kate and Harry.
PURELY CEREMONIAL?
While Andrew dominated newspapers and broadcasts, even overshadowing the recent election, Lacey said September's Supreme Court ruling was more significant, possibly heralding the end of the monarchy's few remaining prerogative powers and posing questions about its future constitutional role.
""It could reduce the monarch to an essentially ceremonial and charitable role,"" he said.
""The new involvement of the Supreme Court doesn't question the existence of the monarchy - yet. But if certain decisions and prerogatives are going to be controlled or taken away, then what has the prime minister got to go to speak to the queen about each week?""
So there will be much to discuss around the Christmas table when the royals - or ""the firm"" as they call themselves - gather at Sandringham estate next week.
One of those whose support they can count on is the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, spiritual leader of the world's 80 million Anglicans.
""I think to ask that they be superhuman saints is not what we should do because nobody is like that,"" he said in an interview with The Big Issue, a magazine that helps the homeless.

""Everybody makes mistakes, everybody is human. I am not commenting on any member of the royal family except to say that I am astonished at what a gift they are to this country.""

The tree is made and decorated with burnt logs, a scorched bicycle, a ruined fire alarm and other destroyed household goods, surrounded by gifts wrapped in glittery red, silver and gold paper. 
The fires have killed six people in New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, destroyed more than 700 homes destroyed and ravaged nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of land.
Fire authorities said on Wednesday 99 fires were still burning.
Artist James Dive said the tree was a symbol of the shadow the disaster has cast over the festive season as well as the resilience of Australian communities.
""Going out there was probably the most impactful part of this whole process,"" he told Reuters. ""...I came back with sort of two impressions. One, was the scale of it. It really does hit you. The silence of it. No birds. Everything's just left.
""But then, I suppose the other part too was seeing the resilience. I mean, seeing the Australian bush already bouncing back, like seed pods, everything opening up.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A proposal by Indonesia's new fisheries minister to remove a cap on exporting baby lobsters has come under fire, with critics saying it could deplete stocks around the archipelago and boost the fishing industry in competitor countries.
Fisheries minister Edhy Prabowo, who was appointed by President Joko Widodo in October, has said reopening exports of lobster larvae, known as seeds, would help support livelihoods.
Prabowo argued that an existing export ban encouraged smuggling and Indonesians could sell seeds to Vietnam, where lobster farming is more developed, media reported.
Former fisheries minister Susi Pudjiastuti, who is popular for blowing up 556 foreign boats caught illegally fishing, implemented the ban on catching and exporting lobster smaller than 8 cm in length, or 200 grams (0.44 lb) in weight, in 2016, to conserve the population.
Pudjiastuti defended her policy on Tuesday in messages on Twitter, including a video of herself on the beach of the lobster producing town of Trenggalek, in East Java province, talking about the importance of not overexploiting the crustacean.
""If we don't care and we don't stop the catching of our lobster seeds, we will only enrich Vietnam and Indonesia will never see any more lobsters in our ocean,"" she said, sitting cross-legged on the beach.
The issue has prompted intervention by President Joko Widodo after going viral on social media with hashtags on Twitter such as #lindungilobsterkita (protect our lobsters) trending. 
Widodo said a review of the ban should not only consider the environmental aspects, but also economic ones.
""Don't only say no (to exports). A balance is needed, but also, it shouldn't be that everything is caught all over the place for exports. That would be wrong too,"" he said. 
Indonesia is a major seafood exporter, but lobster shipments have slumped in recent years to about 1,960 tonnes from 3,330 tonnes in 2016, according to German database company Statista. 
The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia found that undersized lobsters continued to be sold in Indonesia despite the 2016 ban, due to poor law enforcement, and suggested in a report in August more research was needed to help grow the industry and restock the population.

Marking another possible policy change from his predecessor,Prabowo has floated the suggestion that some seized vessels could be handed over to fishermen or authorities rather than destroyed, according to state agency Antara.

The fireworks usually draw thousands of locals and tourists to the picturesque Victoria Harbour and the countdown is broadcast worldwide.
Sparked by a controversial and now-withdrawn extradition bill, the ongoing protests in the former British colony have crippled the tourism and retail sectors, with several high-profile cultural and sporting events canceled in recent months.
The fireworks will be replaced with a ""Symphony of Lights”, a multimedia light show, involving projections on the city's tallest skyscrapers at the stroke of midnight, tourism officials said. The facade of the waterside Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre will be turned into a giant countdown clock.
Small-scale pyrotechnics will be released from nearby rooftops.
The tourism board ""places high importance on public safety of all events it organizes,"" it said in an emailed statement.
""In view of the current situation in Hong Kong, we have decided to adopt a new format.""
The board said tourist arrivals in Hong Kong plunged 56% year-on-year in November, the steepest fall in 15 years, when the city was hit by an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic.
Other events to be canceled include the Hong Kong Football Club Rugby Section's annual rugby 10s tournament, scheduled to be held in April, and Clockenflap, one of Asia’s biggest music festivals, which was scrapped last month.

Prosecutors had demanded the life sentence for Ichiro Kojima, 23, who said he had committed the crime on a 'Shinkansen' train between Tokyo and Osaka out of frustration. During Kojima's trial Japanese media reported he had said spending life in prison ""was a dream"" he welcomed.
The knife attack set off widespread discussion in Japan on how to improve security on the country's network of bullet trains, known for both their speed and safety, as the country braces for a flood of visitors ahead of the Tokyo Summer Olympics next year.
Japan still has capital punishment but prosecutors had stopped short of asking for the death penalty for Kojima, who was 21 when the attack took place. Two women received knife wounds in the incident, while Kojima fatally stabbed Kotaro Umeda, 38, who tried to stop him.
Japan's Shinkansen trains have long been known for their passenger safety. But in 2015, a man set himself on fire on one of the trains, killing himself and another passenger - an incident that prompted the installation of surveillance cameras on train carriages.
Kojima's attack prompted debate in Japan about how to improve security while still keeping trains running smoothly on very tight schedules and without inconveniencing passengers at crowded stations.

Papua has suffered a simmering conflict led by a mostly poorly armed and fractured separatist movement for decades.
Muhammad Aidi, intelligence assistant for Indonesia's special forces unit, said the rebels attacked when soldiers and local residents were transporting goods for year-end celebrations from a helicopter pad to Kulapa village in Intan Jaya regency.""Around 150 meters (500 ft) from the outskirts of the village, suddenly 10 members of an armed separatist group with various weapons attacked,"" Aidi said in a statement, adding the bodies of the two soldiers remained at the location. The rough terrain, bad weather and poor communications in the area were hampering the evacuation of the victims, he said.
Currently, soldiers were guarding the village to ensure the security of residents, he said.
A former Dutch colony, resource-rich Papua was incorporated into Indonesia after a controversial U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. The region has since endured decades of mostly low-level separatist conflict.
After a spike in protests and civil unrest in August, Indonesia sent about 6,000 additional military and police personnel to the region."

The scandal which broke in September was seen as an embarrassment for Ardern and damaging for her centre-left Labour Party-led coalition government ahead of what is expected to be a closely fought general election next year.
Ardern apologized for the party's handling of the complaints earlier this year, and ordered an independent investigation.
The report by investigator Maria Dew QC said there was ""insufficient evidence"" to back up the most serious allegations of sexual assault by the main complainant.
The woman had alleged the party staffer assaulted her in a private residence, and she reported this to the Labour Party.
The report said the complainant's evidence was incorrect in several critical respects in relation to the events of that evening.
Other allegations of sexual harassment made by three women against the respondent were also not established, the report said. The accused man had resigned after reports about the allegations emerged in the media earlier this year.
The inquiry, however, did substantiate complaints about the former staffer's aggressive and overbearing conduct in some meetings, however this was not sufficient to meet the threshold of unlawful bullying.
""Harm has been done to everyone involved,"" Ardern told a media conference after the report was released. ""Now it's time for us to draw a line in the sand."""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Leaders and senior representatives from some 20 Muslim nations flocked to the Malaysian capital on Wednesday to discuss issues agitating Muslims globally at a summit Saudi Arabia decided to snub, and Pakistan ducked out of attending.
No agenda for the Kuala Lumpur Summit has been released, but it could address age-old disputes in Kashmir and the Middle East, the conflicts in Syria and Yemen, the plight of Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority, and mounting outrage over China's camps for Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang - a subject that will doubtless upset Beijing - as well as how to counter the spread of Islamophobia in the world.
Two of the world's most outspoken leaders, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan will be giving their views during the four-day summit, which begins with a welcome dinner on Wednesday and wraps up on Saturday.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, who along with Mahathir and Erdogan had been a prime mover behind the summit, made a belated decision to skip the meeting.
Some Pakistani officials, unnamed because they are not authorized to speak to the media, said Khan pulled out under pressure from close ally Saudi Arabia, though media reports say his officials deny that was the reason why the world's second largest Muslim country won't be represented.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamid Al-Thani, whose countries have tense relations with Saudi Arabia, are also attending.
Explaining its decision to stay away, Saudi Arabia said the summit was the wrong forum for matters of importance to the world's 1.75 billion Muslims, though some analysts suspected the Kingdom feared being diplomatically isolated by regional rivals Iran, Qatar and Turkey.
Saudi state news agency SPA reported that on a call with Mahathir on Tuesday, Saudi King Salman reaffirmed that such issues should be discussed through the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
A Saudi source said Saudi Arabia was invited but would only attend it the meeting was held under the auspices of the OIC.
""They are very concerned about it,"" the source said of the summit, declining to be named as he was not authorized to talk to media.
The Saudi government's center for international communication did not respond to a request for comment.
The absence of Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, whose king also hold the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Mecca and Medina demonstrates some of the divisions in the Muslim world.
""The issue is that you've got blocs,"" said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and Middle East Institute in Singapore. ""You've got a Saudi-UAE bloc, Turkey-Qatari bloc, and Pakistan in the middle trying to hedge their bets.""
Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population, would be represented by Vice-President Ma'ruf Amin, a cleric overseeing the country's fight against radicalization and terrorism.
Even as delegations were arriving in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian officials were unable to provide a final list of who would be attending. Mahathir's office said that invitations had been sent to all 56 OIC member states, but officials said only about 20 were sending delegations, and fewer would be led by heads of state.
Defending the summit, Mahathir's office issued a statement saying there was no intention to create a ""new bloc as alluded to by some of its critics"".
""In addition, the Summit is not a platform to discuss about religion or religious affairs but specifically to address the state of affairs of the Muslim Ummah,"" it said, using the Arabic term for community.
Speaking to Reuters last week, Mahathir expressed frustration with the OIC's inability to forge a united front and act decisively. During that interview, the Malaysian leader also raised the possibility that the alleged mistreatment of Muslim Uighurs in China's Xinjiang would be discussed.
Beijing describes the camps where Uighur Muslims are being held as ""vocational training centers"", while critics say they are mass internment camps.

333,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 12:16AM ET</span>",More than 20% of U.S. of high school seniors vaped THC in 2019: study,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - More than 20% of U.S. high school seniors reported vaping marijuana in 2019, the second largest single-year increase in any substance of abuse ever recorded in the annual study of national drug use trends, researchers reported on Wednesday.
Results of the study https:// funded by the National Institutes of Health are alarming as federal officials continue to investigate fatal lung injuries associated with vaping.
Earlier this week, U.S. officials reported another four vaping-related deaths from a nationwide outbreak of a respiratory illness, taking the toll to 52 deaths and more than 2,400 who have been hospitalized. Most of the injuries have occurred in people who vaped THC, the high-producing ingredient in marijuana.
Compiled by researchers at the University of Michigan and published in the medical journal JAMA, the ""Monitoring the Future"" study found that 21% of 12th graders, 19% of 10th graders and 7% of 8th graders reported vaping THC in the last year.
The increases in all three grades translate into at least 1 million additional THC vapers in 2019 versus 2018, researchers said.
Among 12th graders, that amounted to a 7.7 percentage-point increase, the second-largest for any substance in the study's 45-year history. The largest occurred last year, when it reported a 10.9 percentage-point gain in nicotine vaping, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration characterized as a national epidemic.
""Whatever teens can vape has increased dramatically in the last few years,"" Richard Miech, who led the study, said in emailed comments.
Part of that is because vaping devices are sleek, and easy to hide. Smoking marijuana is much harder to conceal, Miech said.
""Vaping allows teens to get around the policies and procedures put in place to prevent teen drug use,"" he said.
The number of 12th graders who said they had vaped marijuana in the past month doubled from the 2018 survey to 14%. Rates also are rising among younger teens.
The survey found 12.6% of 10th graders reported vaping THC in the past month, up 5.6%, while 3.9% of 8th graders, who are typically about 13-years-old, reported vaping THC in the past month, a 1.3% increase.
'THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE'
Stanton Glantz, a tobacco control expert at the University of California San Francisco who was not involved in the study, said kids who try vaping nicotine are more prone to vaping THC or smoking cigarettes.
""It's like the Bermuda Triangle of substance abuse. There's good research out there showing any kid who does any of those is more likely to do the other ones,"" Glantz said in a phone interview.
The 2019 study also showed another gain in nicotine vaping, which rose 5.6 percentage points from a year ago to 35% of 12th graders.
Asked why they vape, 60% of teens said they wanted to see what it was like, 37% said to relax, and 29% said to feel good or get high. Another 8.1% said they vaped because they are hooked, a figure that rose 4.5% from a year ago.
This year's survey measured daily marijuana vaping for the first time, defined as 20 or more times a month, and found it occurs in 3.5% of 12th graders, 3% of 10th graders and 0.8% of eighth graders.
Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, found those numbers especially troubling.
""When you use marijuana regularly, your risk of becoming addicted is close to 50 percent, particularly if you're a young person,"" she said in a phone interview.
The daily THC vaping question was added before the practice was tied to the nationwide lung injury outbreak. It remains to be seen whether that will encourage some teens to quit.
""We predict that's what will happen,"" Volkow said. ""We don't know."""
334,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 11:43PM ET</span>",Veteran climbers skeptical proposed rules for Mount Everest will stop deaths,"By Andrew Both
Reuters) - Veteran climbers of Mount Everest are skeptical that proposed new regulations by the Nepalese government to tighten the permit process for adventurers will address the root causes of this year's heavy death toll on the world's tallest peak.
American mountaineers Ed Viesturs and Alan Arnette said planned new laws - if they are introduced at all - are unlikely to tackle the growing trend of inexperienced climbers rushing in packs to scale the 29,035-foot (8,850-metre) Himalayan peak.
""I've seen this movie so many times it's totally predictable,"" Arnette told Reuters in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ""Every year since 2013, something goes wrong and they (the Nepal government) announce all these new rules and never implement them.""
Eleven climbers died on Mount Everest this year - nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side. Many perished when a rush to climb the mountain during a short window of suitable weather in late May led to a ""traffic jam"" near the summit.
""Most teams opt to go for the summit when the first weather window is predicted,"" Viesturs told Reuters in one of a series of interviews by phone and email.
""Everyone is afraid of missing what might be the one and only perfect day. There are typically several good summit days, but there's pressure to go when everyone else goes.""
Nepal has traditionally issued climbing permits to anyone prepared to pay the $11,000 fee, handing out a record 381 passes this year. With essential Sherpas and guides added, more than 800 people were trying to reach the summit during the short weather window.
TRAFFIC JAM IN THE DEATH ZONE
The overcrowding - which caught worldwide attention when a photograph of a queue of climbers stepping over bodies to reach the summit went viral - caused fatal delays in the thin air in what is known as the ""death zone"" above 8,000 meters. That raised concerns that inexperienced mountaineers were being encouraged to attempt the climb by unscrupulous guide companies.
Among the changes proposed by the Nepalese government is a requirement for climbers to submit a medical report by a certified doctor disclosing their history and state of health. Another suggested requirement was the climbers submit proof they had scaled another 6,500-metre peak in Nepal.
Arnette said the first change was unlikely to be enough, given the potential to forge medical documents, while the second made little sense as many climbers have scaled higher peaks elsewhere.
The recommendations have been submitted to the cabinet for approval, Mira Acharya, who oversees climbing activities for the Nepal government's Department of Tourism, told Reuters last week. The government has not given a time frame for the introduction of new laws.
Viesturs, who has an extensive history on Everest, said the proposed changes did not do enough to tackle the ""group think"" pack mentality that led to the traffic jam in late May, a problem he said also needed to be addressed by climb leaders at base camp.
""I know several climbers who waited until later and had the mountain almost to themselves,"" Viesturs said of this year's climbing season. ""We really need to answer why so many people are on the summit ridge on the same day? How can you control it?"""

The official death toll from the eruption on White Island, also known by its Māori name of Whakaari, stands at 16. Six bodies were retrieved from the island on Friday.
Those still missing, presumed dead, are Winona Langford, a 17-year-old Australian, and Hayden Marshall-Inman, a 40-year-old New Zealand tour guide. Their bodies are believed to be in the waters around the island.
""We have not given up ... but have reached a phase where we are literally at the hands of the sea,"" New Zealand's Deputy Police Commissioner Mike Clement told reporters at a press conference in Whakatane, the town close to White Island.
""We have to wait for mother nature to produce those bodies ... it may or it may not,"" he added.
Clement said search operations will now be continued by regional officers while the nationally run teams would return.
He said experts believe the two missing bodies were washed out to sea. The tides in the area are such that if a body in the bay reached the open sea, they would be taken in the direction of East Cape, the tip of the North Island, he said.
There were 47 people on the White Island when it erupted last Monday. Of them, 27 are still being treated at hospitals in New Zealand and Australia for severe burn injuries.
There has been criticism that people were allowed on the island, a popular destination for day-trippers, given the risks of an active volcano. That has led to speculation the tragedy could lead to major changes for New Zealand’s thrillseeker tourism industry.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said official inquiries by coroners and work safety regulators into the eruption could take up to a year, and will carry potential criminal penalties of up to five years in jail."
336,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>",Tokyo court orders journalist pay damages to reporter Shiori Ito over alleged rape suit,"By Kiyoshi Takenaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese court on Wednesday ordered prominent reporter Noriyuki Yamaguchi to pay 3.3 million yen ($30,375.55) in damages to journalist Shiori Ito in a civil lawsuit related to her allegations he had raped her.
Ito, 30, had sought 11 million yen in damages for her suffering after prosecutors declined to indict Yamaguchi following her complaint to police that he had raped her while she was unconscious.
Yamaguchi, who has repeatedly denied the allegations, had filed a counter-suit seeking 130 million yen in damages from Ito. The court on Wednesday ruled against his suit. 
Ito made waves in 2017 when she took the rare step of going public with allegations that Yamaguchi, a senior television reporter known for his reporting on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, had raped her in 2015 after she met him for drinks to discuss an offer to help her find a job.
Ito fought back tears as she spoke through a megaphone to reporters and supporters after the verdict outside the court, saying she felt ""full of gratitude.""
""I'm so happy,"" she said, her voice breaking at times with emotion.
Ito wrote in her book about the incident, “Black Box,” that she was forced to re-enact the alleged rape with a life-sized doll while male police watched. She did not identify the policemen. 
Reuters could not confirm this incident or the rest of the account she provided in the book.
A spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police said the department could not immediately comment.
Ito has said she was also trolled on social media by critics.
The events formed the subject of a BBC documentary, ""Japan's Secret Shame"".
Ito wrote in her book that police had obtained an arrest warrant against Yamaguchi but it was not implemented. 
She also wrote that the arrest was called off at the last minute by a senior police official, whom she did not identify.
Ito suggested in the book that she might have been given a “date rape” drug but that she had no way to know. Yamaguchi wrote in a magazine article in 2017 that he had ""neither seen nor heard of the date rape drugs"" Ito mentioned and that she had been ""overconfident about the amount of alcohol and drank too much"".
Ito was an intern at Reuters during the time she said the rape occurred. She left Reuters in June 2015. 
Prosecutors later decided not to bring charges. They do not give reasons for such decisions.
A civil judicial panel later rejected Ito's appeal to force a prosecution, saying it had found no grounds to overturn the prosecutors’ decision. 
At the time, opposition lawmakers questioned whether Yamaguchi had received special treatment because of his close ties to Abe. 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga has denied there were any irregularities regarding the case. 
The head of the National Public Safety Commission, which oversees the police, also denied in parliament that there were any problems with the investigation, media reported at the time.
Legislators revised Japan’s century-old rape law in 2017 to include harsher penalties, including raising the minimum punishment for rapists to five years in prison from three.
The reforms, however, left intact controversial requirements that prosecutors must prove violence or intimidation was involved or that the victim was “incapable of resistance,” prompting calls from academics, activists and psychiatrists for further changes to the law.

Demonstrations erupted in April 2018, when Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega tried to cut welfare benefits, and gradually spread into a broader protest movement against his rule.
Rights groups say the conflict has led to the killings of more than 300 people at the hands of police or armed government-affiliated groups.
Nicaraguans have made up the ""vast majority"" of refugee applications in Costa Rica over the past year and a half, Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado said at the Global Refugee Forum held by the UN Refugee Agency in Geneva.
He added that Nicaraguan refugees were expected to keep arriving.
""We came to request cooperation to guarantee that the refugee population can access their rights,"" Alvarado said.
Since April 2018, when protests in Nicaragua broke out, Costa Rica has received 77,000 refugee applications, according to Alvarado's office. Since September of this year alone, Costa Rica has received 10,000 requests.
The Organization of American States said last month that Nicaragua was experiencing a ""critical human rights situation"" and recommended a special session of its general assembly be convened to review affairs in the country.
Last week, the United States government imposed sanctions on Ortega's son, accusing him of money laundering and corruption."

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China and Russia are pushing the U.N. Security Council to lift some sanctions on North Korea to ease the country's humanitarian concerns and to ""break the deadlock"" in stalled denuclearization talks between Washington and Pyongyang, China's U.N. ambassador said on Tuesday.
On Monday China and Russia proposed the 15-member council lift a ban on North Korea exporting statues, seafood and textiles, and ease restrictions on infrastructure projects and North Koreans working overseas, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters.
""With regard to the sanctions, that's also something DPRK has concerns (with) and their concerns are legitimate,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
""If you want them to do something you need to accommodate their concerns. That's the logic between China and Russia's initiative.""
Asked when the draft resolution could be put to a vote, Zhang said: ""Once we feel we have strong support then we will take further action.""
Council diplomats met on Tuesday to discuss the draft text.
A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, Russia or China to pass.
The United States, Britain and France have insisted that no U.N. sanctions should be lifted until North Korea takes concrete steps to give up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pyongyang has been subject to U.N. sanctions because of those programs since 2006.
A U.S. State Department official said on Monday that now was not the time to consider lifting U.N. sanctions on North Korea as the country was ""threatening to conduct an escalated provocation, refusing to meet to discuss denuclearization, and continuing to maintain and advance its prohibited weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.""
The sanctions on industries that Russia and China have proposed lifting earned North Korea hundreds of millions of dollars and were put in place in 2016 and 2017 to try and cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
""What we are going to do is not to further split the Security Council, but to pursue a united approach in obtaining peace and security there,"" Zhang said.
""The core goal is to send a constructive, positive message to the parties concerned that we do not want a deteriorated situation, we do not want a confrontation, we do encourage them to go forward instead,"" he said.
China hopes the Security Council can speak with one voice on the issue and reach consensus on the draft resolution, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a media briefing earlier on Tuesday.
Concerns were growing internationally that North Korea could resume nuclear or long-range missile testing - suspended since 2017 - because denuclearization talks between Pyongyang and Washington have stalled.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since June 2018, but no progress toward denuclearization has been made and Kim has given Trump until the end of 2019 to show flexibility.
North Korea's U.N. envoy declared this month, however, that denuclearization was off the table."

""The water took away everything,"" said Saranya, who lost four siblings and her family home in the tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people across the coasts of several Asian countries.
In India, the Nagapattinam district where her village is located was the worst-affected area with more than 6,000 deaths, mostly from fishing families residing just meters from the seashore.
Reuters has followed Saranya, who goes by only one name, and her family's journey since the natural disaster altered their lives forever.
Her fisherman father has had difficulty coping and while money, food and shelter provided by aid organizations and the government helped for a few years, Saranya has had to find ways to help feed a brother and a sister born after the tsunami. Her mother died in 2017.
There are also medical bills for her brother Mohan who has physical disabilities.

GUANZHONG, China (Reuters) - Morning market shoppers look a little too long in Liu Peilin's direction as she passes by in a red jacket and gray wig covered in red and pink clips, her cheeks rouged in bright pink and eyeshadow in a matching shade.
The 63-year-old has become well-known not only in the little southern Chinese village where she lives, but also nationally.
In 2012, news reports of a fire in a residential complex in the eastern city of Qingdao captured footage of a man returning to the premises dressed in female clothing with his hair in braids adorned with colorful ornaments.
The video went viral and Chinese netizens dubbed the man ""Big Joy Brother"", mocking him for his cross-dressing.
That was Liu, who had wanted to be a woman since she was a child but had suppressed the yearning for decades.
    ""At that time, it was not allowed,"" she said, referring to the Cultural Revolution, when people wore drab Soviet-inspired uniforms.
""I had to take the social factors into consideration and buried the idea deep down in my heart.""
It was only in her 40s, after China's opening up, that Liu felt she could freely start wearing women's clothes.
Although her brief brush with viral fame gave her an unwanted nickname and invited online mockery, it also brought her into contact with a supportive community.
At the beginning of the year, she was facing eviction when her landlord in Qingdao decided to raise the rent.
People she met helped her move in March to Guanzhong village, just outside the southern city of Fuzhou.
She has also gained fans, who call her ""Sister Liu"". Many send clothes, swelling an expansive wardrobe. Others give her books and even art.
Still, she faces discrimination.

Liu, who is unemployed, says she wants to undergo gender reassignment surgery, but lacks the funding. She documents her daily life by writing in her diary.
""I hope in the future I can have a normal life after changing my gender,"" said Liu.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - For the past six years the United Nations and other aid groups have been crossing into Syria from Turkey, Iraq and Jordan at four places authorized by the U.N. Security Council to deliver humanitarian assistance to millions of people.
The 15-member council is aiming to extend approval for those operations this week, which U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres describes as essential.
Russia, however, wants to cut the number of border crossings in half.
A resolution drafted by Belgium, Kuwait and Germany proposes increasing the authorized border crossings to five - by adding a third from Turkey - but Russia has put forward a rival text that would only approve current operations at two Turkish crossings.
When asked on Tuesday if Russia could veto the draft resolution by Belgium, Kuwait and Germany, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia described that text as ""unacceptable and inviable.""
""If it so happens that our draft does not pass, this will mean that the mechanism that we have proposed to extend will not be extended,"" he told reporters.
A resolution needs nine votes to pass and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain. Last year Russia and China abstained in the council vote to extend approval for the cross-border humanitarian aid deliveries.
Russia has vetoed 13 council resolutions on Syria since a crackdown by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war. Islamic State militants then used the chaos to seize territory in Syria and Iraq.
In a joint statement on Tuesday, Belgium, Kuwait and Germany and their seven elected counterparts on the Security Council expressed support for their draft resolution.
""The consequences of a non-renewal of the mechanism would be disastrous,"" the 10 Security Council members, who are each serving two year terms, said. ""This is a mechanism that enables life-saving assistance to reach 4 million people in Syria.""
In a Dec. 16 report to the Council, Guterres urged members to extend authorization of the cross-border aid deliveries.

Biegun will meet Chinese officials ""to discuss the need to maintain international unity on North Korea,"" the State Department said in a statement.
Biegun will travel to China after holding talks with officials in South Korea and Japan this week.
Tension has been rising in recent weeks as North Korea has conducted a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with U.S. President Donald Trump, stoking fears the two countries could return to the collision course they had been on before launching diplomacy last year.
China and Russia proposed on Monday that the U.N. Security Council lift a ban on North Korea's exporting statues, seafood and textiles, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters.
Russia said the draft, whose measures also included the lifting of a ban on North Koreans working abroad, was aimed at encouraging talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
A U.S. State Department official said now was not the time for the Security Council to consider lifting sanctions as North Korea was ""threatening to conduct an escalated provocation, refusing to meet to discuss denuclearization, and continuing to maintain and advance its prohibited weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.""
North Korea has vowed to take an unspecified ""new path"" if Washington fails to soften its stance before the end of the year.
Biegun ended a three-day visit to South Korea on Tuesday where he tried to salvage negotiations but did not appear to get a response from Pyongyang to his call to discuss ""all issues of interest."" 
On Monday, Biegun reached out directly to the North, saying: ""It is time for us to do our jobs. Let's get this done. We are here, and you know how to reach us.""

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Monday that North Korea would likely carry out unspecified tests if they ""don’t feel satisfied.""

Security Council planned for Tuesday about the situation in the disputed Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir because the U.N. peacekeeping mission there was not ready to provide a brief, diplomats said.
The Himalayan region has long been a flashpoint in ties between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan, with both claiming Kashmir in full but ruling it in part. U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed since 1949 to observe a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir.
China's U.N. mission had on Monday requested the closed door briefing, after Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi wrote to the council to express concern about a possible further escalation of tensions.
Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told the council on Tuesday that he would again request the meeting when the peacekeeping mission was ready to give a detailed briefing.
""We all know the Security Council has received a letter from the foreign minister of Pakistan requesting Security Council discussions and discussions are going on,"" Zhang later told reporters.
The council last met behind closed-doors in August on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, a gathering that was also called by Pakistan ally China, after India removed the decades-old autonomy the area enjoyed under the Indian constitution.
For decades, India has battled insurgency in the portion it controls. It blames Pakistan for fuelling the strife, but Pakistan denies this, saying it gives only moral support to non-violent separatists.
""The situation presents a present danger to peace and security in our region,"" Pakistan's U.N. Ambassador Munir Akram said on Tuesday. ""We welcome the fact that the council remains seized of the matter.""
The Security Council adopted several resolutions in 1948 and in the 1950s on the dispute between India and Pakistan over the region, including one which says a plebiscite should be held to determine the future of mostly Muslim Kashmir.
Another resolution also calls upon both sides to ""refrain from making any statements and from doing or causing to be done or permitting any acts which might aggravate the situation."""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan is ramping up efforts ahead of a Jan. 11 election to combat fake news and disinformation that the government says China is bombarding the island with to undermine its democracy.
But Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China, is crying foul, accusing the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) of running its own disinformation campaign, saying the threat is closer to home.
Taiwan's rambunctious democracy has long been deeply polarized and partisan. 
Accusations of dirty-doings, denials and counter-denials are part and parcel of political life on the island, played out on its many cable news channels and online, mostly on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), messaging app Line and the Taiwan-focused bulletin board PTT.
Fake news and disinformation campaigns are a problem governments around the world are trying to tackle. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly lambasted U.S. media for what he says is its ""fake news"" about him and his administration.
Taiwan, which holds presidential and legislative elections on Jan. 11, says it is particularly vulnerable to influence-peddling by its giant, autocratic neighbor China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be brought under Beijing's rule by force if need be.
""Taiwan is a democratic, open society. They are using our freedom and openness, bringing in news that is not beneficial to the government,"" Chiu Chui-cheng, deputy head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, told Reuters, referring to China.
""They are seeking to confuse the perception of people. It's a perception war,"" he said. ""Mainland China uses organizations in Taiwan to help disseminate fake news.""
But the Kuomintang and its presidential candidate, Han Kuo-yu, lagging in the polls behind President Tsai Ing-wen, say voters should focus on what the ruling party is doing to muddy the waters, and should stop trying to ""smear them red"" - a reference to the colors of China's Communist Party.
    ""Have a look on the internet, isn't about more than 90 percent of online news attacks against Han Kuo-yu?"" Han's campaign spokeswoman, Anne Wang, told Reuters.
She said almost nobody on the PTT bulletin board supported the Kuomintang, which undermined ruling party complaints of Beijing's interference on behalf of the opposition party.
""If mainland China wants to support the Kuomintang, how can that be the result?"" she asked.
""Is their (China's) fake news cyber army too weak? Have they failed? Or is the cyber army in service of the DPP more powerful and ferocious?""
The suicide of Taiwan's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka last year, following fake reports he had not done enough to help Taiwanese stranded by a typhoon, has been seized upon by the Kuomintang, after Taipei prosecutors this month filed charges against one of the people accused of spreading the reports, a prominent DPP member. [https://tinyurl.com/yxyjcfx6]
Kuomintang legislator Lai Shyh-bao said it was ironic that Tsai blamed DPP losses in mayoral elections last year on fake news.
""Now we know that she is the commander of all the fake news,"" Lai said.
The DPP says it had nothing to do with the consul general's death.
""Fake news is encroaching on Taiwan's democracy, splitting apart Taiwan's people. Everyone needs to be on guard,"" DPP spokeswoman Lee Yen-jong said.
'DESTROYING TRUST'
Fact-checking groups say people are being bombarded with fake news and have set up websites and chat rooms, and held seminars, to help people identify it.
Government task forces have been mandated to ""bust rumors"" while a security agency has launched a ""special mission"" to crack down on suspected fake news from China to influence votes, according to an official with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified.
""Fake news destroys trust between people,"" said Johnson Liang, founder of the group Cofacts. 
""When the trust between people has been lost, you won't trust that politicians will do things beneficial to you, neither will you believe that representatives will speak up for you."" 
China denies seeking to interfere in Taiwan's election.
Its policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office said it was ""fake news"" to suggest that it was trying to meddle.
""Every time there is a Taiwan regional election, various fake news is 'created' to make rumors about and smear the mainland,"" the office said in a statement to Reuters. 
The DPP reacted angrily to pictures on social media supposedly showing its deputy secretary-general, Lin Fei-fan, dining with self-professed Chinese spy Wang Liqiang.
Wang has described in Australian media how he worked with China's Communist Party to meddle in Taiwan. China says he is a convicted fraudster. The Kuomintang also says they have serious doubts about his claims.
The DPP says the person identified in the picture as Li is an assistant to a Hong Kong legislator and blamed ""China-friendly forces"" for the ""fake message"".
Internet companies have moved to tackle fake news as the elections approach. Facebook has vowed to step up efforts to counter disinformation and ""state-backed influence operations"".  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN) has teamed up with several advocacy groups to help users verify information. 
Facebook last week removed more than 200 accounts, pages and groups to help ""protect the integrity of Taiwan's elections"".
Taiwan FactCheck Center, which is collaborating with Line, said it had seen a sharp increase in political messages on the platform since September.
""We're overwhelmed,"" said Summer Chen, the group's chief editor.
""There are a lot of rumors before the elections. They are spreading faster and mobilizing hatred,"" she told Reuters, referring to rumors she believed were coming from China.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 06:43PM ET</span>","In Australia's outback town of Oodnadatta, it is just another very hot day","By Jonathan Barrett
SYDNEY (Reuters) - An outback town near Australia's red-hot center barely paused on Wednesday for a heat wave that is gripping the country, fueling fires and prompting widespread health warnings as heat records get set to tumble.
Oodnadatta, a South Australian town of about 200 people located on an old Aboriginal trading route, is forecast to record peak temperatures of 47 degrees Celsius (116.6° Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), making it one of the hottest places on Earth.
""It's just another very hot day,"" said resident Hayley Nunn, who is the manager of the town's distinct pink roadhouse where tourists stop on their way to and from Australia's Simpson Desert.
""People say to me they love summer. If you love summer, come out and experience this because you will not love it,"" Nunn said in a phone interview.
The unrelenting heat in Oodnadatta, forecast to repeat every day for at least the next week, is expected to fall just shy of the 50.7-degree C (123.26 F) temperature recorded there in 1960, a long-standing national record.
But other heat records are tumbling in the first month of the Southern (NYSE:SO) Hemisphere summer.
Australia's warmest day on record occurred in January 2013, when the average maximum temperature across the country was 40 C (105.4 F), according to BOM data.
That mark is expected to be exceeded on Wednesday and then again on Thursday and Friday.
The hot weather is stretching across the continent and fuelling fires that have been ravaging Australia's east since late spring.
Fire authorities in the state of New South Wales (NSW) said on Wednesday there were 99 fires, half of which were not contained.
Fires have killed six people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland.

BATTLE ON TWO FRONTS
Australia is being hit with two separate climate-driving events off its west and southern coasts - a positive Indian Ocean Dipole and negative Southern Annulare Mode - that are reducing rainfall and increasing temperatures.
""They have combined together to create this situation of a particularly nasty heat wave event,"" said BOM meteorologist Sarah Scully.
The extreme conditions have been exacerbated by a warming climate, which is triggering large-scale protests in a nation that is committed to exploiting its vast coal reserves.
The combination of thick smoke settling over populated areas and intense heat has triggered numerous health warnings across the country, especially for the young and the old, and those with respiratory conditions.
In Oodnadatta, where the temperature is only expected to drop to around 30 C (86 F) overnight, locals are warning travelers to take plenty of water on their car trips in case they break down on the long stretches of isolated roads.
""Between most towns, it's 200 kilometers (124.3 miles),"" said Nunn.
Nunn said Oodnadatta falls into a rhythm in the summer where people do jobs early in the morning and late in the afternoon, while sheltering from the heat in the middle of the day.
""I grew up here, I'm used to the heat. You cope but it's not fun."""
348,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 06:36PM ET</span>",U.S. Congress pressures Trump to renew Russia arms control pact,"By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers of both parties are pressuring the White House to extend the last remaining restraints on U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons deployments by demanding intelligence assessments on the costs of allowing the New START treaty to lapse.
The demands, contained in three bills that may be harmonized this week, reflect doubts about whether the Trump administration has done sufficient analytical work on how China and Russia may respond to the 2010 treaty's expiration in February 2021.
New START restricted the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads, the lowest level in decades, and limited the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers that deliver them.
It can be renewed for up to five years if both sides agree. Moscow has offered to immediately extend the treaty. Washington still is considering the issue.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his aides have argued that New START does not cover all Russian nuclear weapons and said they want to bring China, which they increasingly view as the primary, long-term threat, into a wider arms control framework.
Some lawmakers and arms control experts view the proposal as a ""poison pill"" to kill New START, ending restraints on U.S. strategic nuclear weapons deployments, because China rejects the idea.
In May, Trump announced that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed a possible new accord limiting nuclear arms that eventually could include China.
Three days later China, estimated to have only about 300 nuclear weapons, dismissed the idea of participating in trilateral nuclear arms reduction talks.
China's arsenal is dwarfed by those of the United States and Russia. Both are estimated to have over 6,000 deployed, stockpiled or retired (and awaiting dismantlement) nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists.
Lawmakers, congressional aides and former officials say they are unaware of the administration conducting any formal intelligence estimates of the implications of New START's expiration either before or after Trump unveiled the idea.
Nor are they aware of extensive inter-agency deliberations on devising a negotiating stance with China, or even whether any negotiations with China have occurred.
""What we don't want to see is ... China used as an excuse to blow up the existing, or potential extension of an agreement with Russia that contributes to international security and ... that's very important to our survival,"" Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley said at a Dec. 3 hearing.
Senator Todd Young, a Republican, on Wednesday will propose, as an amendment to unrelated Russian sanctions legislation, a measure that would require U.S. intelligence estimates on how Russian and Chinese nuclear forces may evolve if New START expires.
The House of Representatives foreign affairs committee also plans on Wednesday to consider similar legislation sponsored by Democratic Chairman Eliot Engel and the senior Republican, Representative Michael McCaul, a congressional aide said.
Another aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Senate bill, originally introduced by Young and Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, was being harmonized with similar language in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
The latest version of the NDAA, which passed the Senate on Tuesday, also demands intelligence estimates on Russia's nuclear arsenal in a post-New START world but does not do so for China.
If the three bills converge, the Trump administration may find itself forced to share with Congress intelligence assessments on the implications of abandoning New START and some details on its discussions with Russia and China.
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the bills, whether such intelligence assessments have been done or whether the inclusion of China was a ""poison pill.""
Thomas Countryman, a former acting undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, said there were limited ways to persuade China to enter into negotiations.
""You could offer to let the Chinese build up to the U.S. and Russia level (of 6,000 warheads) ... you could offer to take Russia and the U.S. down to 300. Or you could suggest to the Chinese that they stay at 300 and we'll stay at 6,000.

    ""Only the second one has a chance of being accepted by the Chinese, but it's not acceptable, unfortunately, to the Pentagon or the Kremlin,"" Countryman said.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 06:16PM ET</span>",Giuliani associate paid $1 million by indicted Ukrainian oligarch's lawyer: prosecutor,"By Brendan Pierson and Karen Freifeld
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said in court on Tuesday that Lev Parnas, an associate of U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, received a $1 million payment from a lawyer for Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash.
Prosecutors said that the Ukraine-born U.S. citizen Parnas, who has been charged with campaign finance violations, concealed the payment from them and said his bail should be revoked because he posed an ""extraordinary risk"" of fleeing the United States.
However, U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in New York ruled at a hearing on Tuesday that Parnas may remain under house arrest in Florida. Parnas had not made any ""clear or direct misstatement"" about his finances, Oetken said.
""I feel so relieved,"" Parnas, who was arrested in October, said after the hearing.
Parnas was charged alongside another Florida businessman, Belarus-born Igor Fruman, with illegally funneling money to a pro-Trump election committee and other politicians. Fruman and Parnas have pleaded not guilty.
Their case is unfolding as prosecutors investigate payments made to Giuliani, who has not been charged with a crime and has denied any wrongdoing. 
Giuliani has said Parnas and Fruman assisted him in investigating Trump's political rival Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
Giuliani has emerged as a key figure in the impeachment probe of Trump. Democrats have accused the Republican president of abusing his power to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Trump has called the impeachment probe a witch hunt.
Last week, prosecutors told Oetken that Parnas had concealed information about his finances, including a $1 million payment he had received from an account in Russia in September. 
The account into which the payment was deposited was in the name of Parnas' wife, Svetlana Parnas, according to court filings. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebekah Donaleski said in court the source of the payment was Firtash's lawyer and that it was meant for Parnas. She said it was not plausible the lawyer would extend ""an unsecured, undocumented loan to a housewife with no assets."" 
A lawyer for Parnas, Joseph Bondy, identified Firtash's attorney as Swiss national Ralph Oswald Isenegger and said that Isenegger had asked for the money back. Bondy denied that Parnas hid the payment from prosecutors.
Reuters was unable to reach Isenegger for comment.
Firtash, one of Ukraine's wealthiest businessman, is fighting extradition by U.S. authorities on bribery charges from Vienna, where he has lived for five years. 
Firtash’s spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesman for diGenova & Toensing, a law firm that represents Firtash, said the firm had ""no knowledge"" of the $1 million payment to Svetlana Parnas' account.
Prosecutors also said on Tuesday that Parnas had concealed $200,000 in income he earned working for diGenova & Toensing. The firm previously said that Parnas worked as an interpreter in connection with Firtash.
Prosecutors cited Firtash as an example of Parnas' wealthy foreign connections in arguing that he was a flight risk.

Bondy denied Parnas hid the law firm income and said Parnas ""has absolutely no continuing relationship with Mr. Firtash.""

In June, Greece downgraded bribery of public officials from a felony to a misdemeanor, softening sanctions for such crimes. The move prompted strong disapproval from the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
That criticism led to Greece's reintroduction of stronger criminal legislation on bribery offences in November.
The Council of Europe is the continent's main human rights watchdog, and GRECO said on Tuesday that it was still concerned June's downgrading would have ""longstanding retroactive consequences"" as corruption crimes by public officials committed before November would still be considered misdemeanors.
In a statement, GRECO said a new feature of the criminal legislation allowing prosecutors to abstain from prosecuting misdemeanors punishable with up to a three-year imprisonment might weaken the fight against corruption and money laundering.
It urged Greek authorities to ""strictly limit the scope of corruption offences that can be subject to abstention of prosecution, by ensuring that this can be applied only in exceptional, minor cases of corruption offences"".
GRECO urged Greece to comply with international standards against money laundering and combating financing of terrorism, ""in relation to a recent initiative to amend the money-laundering legislation""."

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - The Canadian government tried its best to consult indigenous groups about plans to expand its oil pipeline and undertook ""no conspiracy"" to ram it through the approval stage, a federal lawyer said in court on Tuesday.
A court ruled in August 2018 that Ottawa had failed to properly consult indigenous people, prompting the government to redo the process before reapproving the Trans Mountain expansion (TMC.UL) project in June. But in September, the Federal Court of Appeal agreed to hear fresh concerns from four indigenous groups that the government fell short again in consulting them.
A three-day hearing began in Vancouver on Monday to hear those concerns. The project is one of several stalled pipeline expansions proposed to ease the oil industry's congested export channels.
The Canadian government consulted 129 groups and was determined to be transparent, providing internal notes about the project's potential impact despite not being legally required to do so, said its lawyer, Dayna Anderson.
""There's no conspiracy, there's no suppression, there's no alteration of scientific views, there's no nefarious action going on,"" Anderson said. ""There was good-faith engagement.""
The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple capacity to move 890,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta to a port terminal near Vancouver. Construction continues despite the court challenge.
One indigenous community told a different story earlier on Tuesday.
Squamish Nation in British Columbia received government reports on the impact of marine spills only after federal consultations with its officials had concluded in June, Michelle Bradley, a lawyer for Squamish said. 
When it did receive the reports - peer reviews of indigenous groups' expert reports - Squamish said it discovered too late for discussion that the government's own scientists agreed with the communities that much is not understood about how spilled bitumen would react in bodies of water.
""Information was disclosed far too late,"" Bradley said. ""It took place in a flurry of activity at the very end or even after the consultative process.""
Anderson, the government's attorney, said the information in question were summaries, not peer reviews. 
Understanding the impacts of a bigger pipeline are important, especially because of threats from noise and marine traffic to endangered southern resident killer whales, Squamish lawyer Matthew Kirchner said.
""We don't know how much more the whales can take.""

The hearing is scheduled to last through Wednesday, when lawyers for the oil-producing provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan are among the scheduled speakers.

Prosecutors Sergio Colaiocco and Michele Prestipino have been investigating Regeni's killing in coordination with Egyptian officials, but after almost five years no-one has been charged with the killing.
Italy last year placed five members of Egypt's security forces under official investigation for their alleged involvement in the disappearance of Regeni, a 28-year-old postgraduate student at Cambridge University.
Egyptian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in Regeni's killing. There was no immediate comment from authorities in Egypt on the prosecutors' remarks.
Colaiocco told the first session of a parliamentary commission set up to review the case that Regeni had been the focus of significant scrutiny by security forces in Cairo.
""A web was spun by Egypt's national security service from the October preceding his death, a web in which the apparatus used the people closest to Giulio in Cairo,"" Colaiocco said. People who knew Regeni had passed information about him to the security services, he alleged.
Regeni disappeared on Jan. 25, 2016 - the fifth anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising that ended the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak.
Intelligence and security sources told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-regeni-exclusive-idUSKCN0XI1YU in 2016 that police had arrested Regeni outside a Cairo metro station and then transferred him to a compound run by Homeland Security. The police have denied this.
Colaiocco said unspecified Egyptian officials had tried on four occasions to mislead the investigation - including claiming Regeni might have died in a car accident and then suggesting he was killed by a five-strong criminal gang, who in turn were shot dead by Egyptian police. 
Regeni had been researching https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/egypt-regeni Egypt's independent unions for his doctoral thesis. 
Prestipino told parliamentarians a lack of bilateral judicial pacts between Egypt and Italy complicated coordination.

""The public prosecutor's office will continue with determination to do all it can to find evidence and work out what happened,"" he added.

Genaro Garcia Luna, 51, waived his right to a detention hearing in Dallas federal court, in an appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge David Horan, according to court records.
The defendant is expected to be transferred to Brooklyn, New York, where federal prosecutors charged him with drug trafficking conspiracy and making false statements.
Garcia Luna, who lived in Florida before his arrest, could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
Rose Romero, a lawyer for Garcia Luna, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Garcia Luna led Mexico's Federal Investigation Agency from 2001 to 2005 and was secretary of public security from 2006 to 2012.
Prosecutors have said the Sinaloa cartel bribed Garcia Luna throughout his time in government to ensure safe passage for its drugs, and obtain information about rival cartels and Mexican probes into its activities.

Guzman was sentenced to life in prison without parole and moved to a high-security facility in Colorado after being convicted of smuggling tons of drugs to the United States over a decades-long career.

President Nicolas Maduro's government, which has for years ignored congressional decisions, has launched criminal probes of opposition lawmakers in what critics call an intimidation campaign to silence adversaries.
The reform to voting procedures increases the number of legislators who would be eligible to participate in the Jan 5 election for congressional leadership. Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who in January cited articles of the constitution to assume an interim presidency, is seeking re-election.
    Lawmakers voted to approve ""the use of technologies for virtual participation"" of members of parliament who face state persecution. Previously, the legislature could not approve measures without the physical presence of 50 percent of the legislators or their substitutes. 
Opposition leaders say the ruling Socialist Party is seeking to prevent Guaido's re-election by pressuring legislators not to be present for the session. 
""We will not sell out, they will not break us,"" said lawmaker Carlos Valero. Others said during the session that they were offered briefcases of cash to skip the Jan 5 leadership vote.
    The information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Maduro dismisses Guaido as a puppet of the United States who is conspiring to overthrow him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation to slap sanctions on companies building a massive underwater pipeline to bring Russian natural gas to Germany, but it was uncertain whether the measures would slow completion of the project. 
The Senate easily passed the U.S. defense policy bill with language backed by Senators Ted Cruz, a Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, imposing sanctions on companies laying pipeline for the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project. It now goes to the White House, where President Donald Trump is expected to sign it.
Senator Jim Risch, a Republican and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the sanctions will prevent the project's completion and are an ""important tool to counter Russia's malign influence and to protect the integrity of Europe's energy sector.""
Nord Stream 2, led by state-owned Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), would allow Russia to bypass Poland and Ukraine to deliver gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany. U.S. lawmakers say Ukraine could lose billions of dollars in transit fees if it is built.
The Trump administration, like the Obama administration before it, has opposed the pipeline, saying it would increase Russia's political grip on Europe. Washington has touted exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to provide Europe alternatives to gas pipelined from Russia.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass has rejected U.S. sanctions as ""foreign interference,"" but there is concern in Europe's biggest economy that the measures could slow the project's completion.
A document from Germany's Economics Ministry, cited by the Bild newspaper, showed Berlin believes U.S. sanctions could hit construction of the pipeline off Denmark.
The bill targets companies based in Western Europe laying the pipeline. Dutch-Swiss company Allseas, which is laying pipeline off the Danish island of Bornholm, also could be hit.
The sanctions would require the U.S. secretary of state to issue a report within 60 days on vessels that are engaging in pipe-laying for the Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream pipelines.
If a company is listed in the reports, it would then be blacklisted by Washington unless the president determined the company was winding down the operations. The president could also waive the sanctions based on national security considerations. 

Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said last month Nord Stream 2 was expected to begin operations in mid-2020, but Gazprom said the timing will depend on weather.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Deforestation on protected indigenous lands in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was almost three times higher than the loss of trees in the region as a whole and the highest since 2008, according to a new study based on satellite imagery.
The data from Brazil's space research institute INPE studied by ISA, a socio-environmental NGO working with indigenous people, shows that between August 2018 and July 2019 deforestation on reservations reached 42,600 hectares.
That represents only 4% of overall loss of forest in the Amazon in the same period (totaling 9,762 square kilometers or 976,200 hectares), but it is a dramatic increase over previous years and the highest since this data was first collected in 2008.
According to the study, land grabbers and illegal loggers and miners are the main drivers of deforestation on indigenous reservations, where the rainforest has been protected by law.
""Indigenous lands are a strong barrier to deforestation. Where there are tribes there are trees,"" said Antonio Oviedo, the ISA researcher who authored the study. He warned, however, that year's deforestation has surged above the recent trend due to increased outside pressure on protected lands.
Invasions of tribal lands have increased since last year, leading to deadly clashes with indigenous people and deliberately set fires aimed at clearing forest for cattle pastures, according to environmentalists who blame President Jair Bolsonaro for advocating development of the Amazon.
Deforestation in indigenous areas had been falling steadily since 2008, to a low point of just over 5,000 hectares in 2014, but then began to rise again. In 2017, it reached 11,000 hectares, and jumped to almost 25,000 hectares in 2018, but this year it surged by 174% over the average for the decade.
ISA said the vast majority of the 424 reserves studied have lost less than 10% of their native forests, but 20% have lost almost half of their forest cover and 5% have virtually no trees left.
The worst recent deforestation was detected on the Ituna-Itatá reservation south of Altamira in Pará state, followed by the Apyterewa reservation in São Felix do Xingu, where the government had to send troops this year to remove invaders."

The civic group Million Moments for Democracy has sought to put pressure on the billionaire premier with a series of demonstrations this year, although Babis's political party ANO maintains a solid lead in polls.
The group has demanded his former business empire Agrofert be cut off from European Union subsidies and public contracts and have called on him to resign.
The hour-long march on Tuesday from Prague's central Wenceslas Square (NYSE:SQ) to the government office drew fewer people than a protest last week that numbered several tens of thousands. Police estimated 15,000 took part in the demonstration on Tuesday, according to CTK news agency.
""We are here because we don't want to tolerate the continued disintegration of the political culture in our country,"" Million Moments leader Mikulas Minar told crowds who chanted ""Resignation"" before marching.
""We don't want to tolerate that it becomes the norm to skirt laws, be in a conflict of interest and publicly lie."" 
Protests were called after the country's top prosecutor reopened this month a case against Babis, suspecting that he hid ownership of one of his firms a decade ago so it would qualify for a 2 million euro subsidy.
Separately, an audit by the European Commission, the European Union's executive, leaked to Czech media this month.
The report showed the Commission saw Babis in a conflict of interest because he still had control over Agrofert, a conglomerate he had built over the past two decades and put into trust funds in 2017 before he became prime minister.
Babis has denied wrongdoing and has said he met legal requirements on conflict of interest with the funds. 
Agrofert firms span farming, food processing, chemicals and media, and are among the central European country's main recipients of various EU money, from farm subsidies that are given per hectare or per animal to project-based finance for innovation and environmental investments.
Babis's ANO party has held about 30% support in political polls, double his closest competitor, despite the protests. In November a rally timed with the 30th anniversary to the end of communist rule drew a quarter of a million people.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority (PA) said on Tuesday its heralded national election must also be held in East Jerusalem, an area annexed by Israel, raising a demand on which a still-unscheduled vote could hinge.
Palestinians' last parliamentary ballot in 2006 resulted in a surprise win by Hamas, widening an internal political rift that led to the Islamist group's seizure of the Gaza Strip in 2007 and contributed to the long delay in setting further elections.
PA President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the rival Fatah party and is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said in September he would issue a decree for national elections, but gave no date.
Hamas supported the move, while PA officials put Israel on the spot by requesting it again allow polling stations in East Jerusalem to operate, as they had in the parliamentary ballot in 2006 and a presidential election a year earlier.
That message was echoed on Tuesday by Abbas, who said in a statement issued by the PA's WAFA news agency that ""legislative elections must be held in Jerusalem"".
Israel forbids any official activity in Jerusalem by the Western-backed PA, saying it breaches 1990s interim peace deals with the Palestinians. An Israeli official said on Tuesday Israel was aware of the Palestinians' request but ""has not yet taken a position on it"". 
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move that has not won international recognition. It regards all of Jerusalem as its capital.
Palestinians seek East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they want to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
The PA's 2.2 million registered voters are split among East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. Jerusalem is home to more than 300,000 Palestinians and 500,000 Israelis. The Palestinian Central Elections Commission says Jerusalem has 75,401 eligible Palestinian voters. 
Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat, speaking to Reuters at the Doha Forum in Qatar on Sunday, said an Israeli refusal to allow voting in East Jerusalem ""would be a major problem"" and could stop the vote from taking place entirely.
But a poll released Tuesday by the West Bank-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research showed some 56 percent of Palestinians believe the elections should proceed even if East Jerusalem is excluded.
Tareq Baconi, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, said the Palestinian leadership might have raised the East Jerusalem issue to avoid holding elections after more than a decade in power.

""East Jerusalem is exactly the alibi the Palestinian leadership needs ... (It will) be able to fault Israel for refusing to allow elections to go ahead,"" Baconi said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Bolivia's former President Evo Morales defended his right to be involved in politics on Tuesday and said he would campaign to help his socialist party win new elections after he resigned under pressure in November and sought refuge abroad.
The leftist leader, in his first press conference since arriving in Argentina last week, said he planned to remain active in his Movement to Socialism (MAS) party as it mulls several names for candidacy in the next elections.
""I am not a candidate. I will not be a candidate as things are, but I have the right to do politics,"" Morales said. ""I am convinced that we will win the upcoming elections again.""
Morales named Luis Arce Catacora, his former economy minister, and Andronico Rodriguez, a key coca farmer union boss, as potential MAS presidential candidates.
A date for the next elections has not been set.
Morales, who had been in power for nearly 14 years, resigned and left Bolivia in mid-November after an Organization of American States audit found serious irregularities in the way votes were counted in the Oct. 20 election.
Morales resigned under pressure from the armed forces and maintains that he was ousted in a right-wing ""coup."" He left for Mexico where he spent about a month before flying to Buenos Aires.
After interim Bolivian President Jeanine Anez took over, lawmakers passed a bill that bars candidates who have already served two presidential terms, eliminating Morales from the race.
Morales arrived in Argentina two days after the inauguration of President Alberto Fernandez who had said before taking office that Morales would be welcome in the country."

SIGONELLA, Italy (Reuters) - NATO will receive its second U.S.-made Global Hawk drone on Thursday and aims to have all five unmanned aircraft of its $1.5 billion surveillance system operational in 2022, alliance officials said on Tuesday.
After years of delays, the drone system, which NATO says will be the world's most advanced, will give the alliance 24-hour, near-real time surveillance of land and sea beyond its borders and provide greater visibility than satellites.
""It's been a very, very long road,"" said Brigadier General Volker Samanns, a senior manager at the NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) drone system, which was first discussed three decades ago and was scheduled to operate from 2017.
Having resolved contractual disputes over cost with manufacturer Northrup Grumman, the first drone was delivered last month to the Sigonella air base in Italy.
Following Thursday's delivery of a second drone, three more will come by next summer, Samanns said.
""We are basically creating a small air force,"" he told reporters at the air base in Sicily, where NATO showed off the drone, which can fly for up to 30 hours at high altitude in all weather, seeing through clouds and storms to produce detailed maps, photos and data for commanders.
Fifteen NATO allies have funded the acquisition of the aircraft, including Germany, Poland, the United States and Italy, as well as ground stations built by Airbus.
All 29 allies will have access to the intelligence they generate, which could include missile sites in Russia, militant activity in the Middle East or pirates off the coast of Africa.
The drones will be piloted remotely from Sigonella and will fly within NATO airspace, but could be flown more widely in a conflict. Drones are increasingly a feature in modern warfare because of their long flying times and intelligence-gathering.
The delivery of the NATO drones marks a breakthrough for European allies after Germany canceled plans to buy its own Global Hawks due to cost and certification issues, while a Franco-German project for a Eurodrone has been delayed.
They also help underpin Western efforts to remain more technologically advanced than Russia and China, officials said.
Brigadier General Phillip Stewart, a former Global Hawk commander in the United States, said he did not believe Moscow and Beijing had the sophistication of the NATO system.
""This is a quantum leap forward,"" Stewart told reporters.
The delivery comes as NATO is spending $1 billion to modernize its 14 AWACS reconnaissance planes, which along with the drones, are the few military assets owned by NATO."

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani court sentenced former military dictator Pervez Musharraf to death in absentia on Tuesday on treason charges stemming from his imposition of a state of emergency in 2007. 
Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup and later ruled as president until 2008, is out of the country and did not comment on a ruling widely seen as part of a standoff between the judiciary and military over the rule of law.
""Pervez Musharraf has been found guilty of Article 6 (of the constitution) for violation of the constitution of Pakistan,"" government law officer Salman Nadeem said.
The full ruling by a special anti-terrorism court was not immediately available but the three judges reached a majority verdict, with two of them deciding against Musharraf.
Musharraf, 76, is the first former army chief to be charged with treason in Pakistan and has said the powerful military helped him get out of the country.
In a strongly worded statement, the army said the ruling had caused ""pain and anguish"" in the ranks and added: ""The due legal process seems to have been ignored."" 
It said the case had been concluded in haste and that Musharraf ""fought wars for the defense of the country (and) can surely never be a traitor.""
Musharraf imposed a state of emergency at a time when he faced growing opposition to his rule. All civil liberties, human rights and democratic processes were suspended from November 2007 to February 2008.
The final years of his rule were marked by struggles with the judiciary over his wish to remain head of the army while president. He quit in 2008, after a political party that backed him fared poorly in a national election. 
VIDEO RECORDING FROM HOSPITAL BED 
In a video recording issued from a hospital bed in Dubai, Musharraf said last month he was not being given a fair hearing in the case, filed in 2013 by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, whose government was ousted by Musharraf in 1999.
""I served the nation and made decisions for the betterment of the country,"" Musharraf said. 
A lawyer representing Musharraf said he would challenge the court ruling.
Ahsan Iqbal, an aide to Sharif, hailed the ruling as a big day for democracy and hoped it would help end ""the tradition of violating the constitution.""
Senator Pervaiz Rashid, also an aide to Sharif, called it a landmark ruling that would help constrain the military.
""We have secured our future generations,"" he said.
The judiciary has been increasingly assertive in its battle with the military to establish the rule of law.

Three weeks ago, the Supreme Court struck down a three-year extension of army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa's tenure, saying were no legal or constitutional grounds to grant the general another term after his retirement on Nov. 29.

The northwest corner of the country, including the Idlib region, is the last significant swathe of Syrian territory still in insurgent hands after eight and a half years of war.
Russia, which has backed President Bashar al-Assad against rebels and Islamist militants, and Turkey, long a supporter of rebels, co-sponsored a conflict ""de-escalation"" deal for the area earlier this year that has since faltered.
Two members of local rescue services said at least four people were killed and scores hurt when aerial bombs fell on a major market in the rural town of Maasran. Another six civilians lost their lives when the town of Bdama was hit, they said.
Videos posted on social media and confirmed by residents showed emergency crews pulling charred bodies along the debris-strewn streets of Maasran as ambulances were arriving.
A further five people were killed in the nearby town of Telmanas in the southeastern part of Idlib province, according to Abdullah al-Halabi of the local rescue service.
Air strikes on several villages in the area had killed another two dead two people and injured scores, he added.
Syrian state media carried no reports of military operations by the Syrian army or its Russian ally in those areas.
The Idlib region is home to hundreds of thousands of people who fled other parts of Syria as government forces wrested back large areas of the country following Russian intervention on Assad's side in early 2015 that tipped the war in his favor.
There has been no major ground offensive since Turkish-backed rebel forces retook territory seized by Moscow and its Syrian allies in rural parts of east Idlib province last month, rebels and diplomats say.
Russian-backed forces have kept up air strikes on populated areas to wear down rebel forces that have so far repelled government attempts to seize back terrain.
Islamist militant groups have also foiled repeated attempts by Russian-backed forces to advance into rural, inland parts of coastal Latakia province where they have dug in for years.
While the Damascus government has vowed to recover all of Idlib, its immediate priority is to retake key pre-war highways that pass through the province to shore up Syria's sanctions-battered economy, Western diplomatic sources say."

Lebanon has been gripped by protests since Oct. 17, leading to the resignation of Saad al-Hariri as prime minister, amid anger at the government's failure to address the country's worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
Security forces lobbed tear gas overnight in central Beirut to disperse supporters of the Shi'ite Amal party of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and its ally the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement. 
Hundreds of men on motorcycles waving their party flags chanted ""Shi'ite, Shi'ite"". They set tyres on fire, hurled stones at security forces and torched cars, witnesses said. 
They said they were furious at a video that circulated online in which a man curses their party and religious leaders, including Berri and Imam Ali, using language that could be inflammatory in a country with deep sectarian divisions.
The men tried to break a security cordon around a square where tents have been set up as part of the wave of protests against the ruling elite which erupted two months ago.
In a statement after meeting on Tuesday, Berri and Hariri, two of the country's top leaders, urged the Lebanese ""not to get dragged toward strife"" and to maintain civil peace.
""The national need has become more than pressing to speed up forming the government,"" the statement added. 
Lebanon's main parties have feuded over how to agree a new government since Hariri - the leading Sunni politician - resigned under pressure from the protests. He has stayed on as caretaker prime minister. 
The job of premier is reserved for a Sunni, according to the country's sectarian power-sharing system. 
The Internal Security Forces said on Tuesday that 65 police were injured in the violence overnight and three people were detained. 
In the mainly Sunni city of Sidon and the mainly Shi'ite city of Nabatieh in the south, groups of men also attacked protest tents overnight, local TV stations said. 
Angry at chants against their politicians, Amal and Hezbollah supporters have at times attacked protesters who are seeking to remove a political class that has dominated Lebanon since the civil war.

The unrest took a violent turn at the weekend when security forces fired tear gas in Beirut at protesters and dozens of people were wounded in the clashes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday came out in support of Arsenal player Mesut Ozil for his criticism of China's treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims, saying Beijing can censor the team's football games but cannot hide rights violations.
The Arsenal midfielder, a German Muslim of Turkish origin, last week in social media posts called Uighurs ""warriors who resist persecution"" and criticized both China's crackdown and the silence of Muslims in response.
China's state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday removed Arsenal's Premier League game against Manchester City from its broadcast schedule.
""China's Communist Party propaganda outlets can censor Mesut Ozil and Arsenal's game all season long, but the truth will prevail,"" Pompeo tweeted. ""The CCP can't hide its gross #humanrights violations perpetrated against Uighurs and other religious faiths from the world.""
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions in Xinjiang as part of what Beijing calls an antiterrorism campaign.
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs.
On Monday, China's Foreign Ministry said Ozil ""had been completely deceived by fake news and false statements.""
Washington has been ratcheting up its criticism of Beijing over Uighurs simultaneously as it has continued its trade deal negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump in November signed into law congressional legislation backing protesters in Hong Kong despite angry objections from China.
Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation requiring a stronger response to Beijing's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority.
What started as demonstrations against a now-withdrawn bill allowing extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China has morphed into calls for greater democratic freedoms and nearly six months of sometimes violent protests in Hong Kong. Beijing has condemned the unrest and blamed foreign interference.
Arsenal on Saturday tried to distance itself from Ozil’s comments after he posted messages on Twitter and Instagram. ""The content he expressed is entirely Ozil’s personal opinion,"" the official account of Arsenal said in a post on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform.
The controversy is the latest between the sports industry and China. In October, an executive with the National Basketball Association expressed support for the pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, angering Beijing and suddenly putting on shaky ground the league's estimated $4 billion market in China."

LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers re-elected Labour's Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker on Tuesday, as he vowed to be impartial and fair in a moderating role which saw his predecessor John Bercow accused of breaking convention to help opponents of Brexit.
With a lack of majority government since 2017, rivals had more power to challenge the ruling Conservatives' plans and the Speaker took an increasingly key role in the process of debating Brexit and passing laws needed to implement, or delay, it.
Bercow, who stood down in October after 10 years, was accused by some of breaking long-accepted norms and favoring those who wanted to stop the government's exit plans.
But last week Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives won a large majority of 80 in the House of Commons, giving him the freedom to push his agenda through parliament much more easily and diminishing the Speaker's influence over it.
Hoyle, 62, who was first elected in November just before parliament was dissolved for the five-week general election campaign, was re-elected uncontested. He had been deputy speaker since 2010.
""A speaker has to be trusted,"" Hoyle said, before two lawmakers carried out the parliamentary tradition of dragging him to the Speaker's chair. ""I have a proven track record of being impartial, independent and fair.""
The Speaker is the arbiter of procedural disputes in the Commons, parliament's lower chamber, and determines which potential challenges to the government's plans are allowed.
A Member of Parliament for the seat of Chorley in his native Lancashire, northern England, since 1997, Hoyle ran his own texitle printing business before entering parliament. His father, Doug, was also a Labour member of parliament.
Fellow Labour lawmaker Lisa Nandy, tipped as a possible successor to leader Jeremy Corbyn, praised Hoyle, saying voters who view parliament ""as a bastion of privilege where ordinary people like them cannot wield power"" saw Hoyle as one of them.
""We have done this place a service by electing someone to be our face and our voice, who people many miles distant from here, see as one of their own,"" she said.
Hoyle has several pets named after famous British politicians, including a parrot called Boris, which he says he has taught to say the Speaker's common refrain of ""Order, order"".
Congratulating Hoyle, Johnson lead a chant of his ubiquitous election slogan ""Get Brexit done"", saying: ""I think even your parrot, Mr Speaker, would have been able to cite that one by now."""

LONDON (Reuters) - A Dubai bank shuttered accounts earlier this year of a secret offshore company belonging to a Maltese businessman since charged with the murder of an investigative journalist, two banking officials have said.
The businessman, Yorgen Fenech, was charged last month with complicity in the 2017 killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia, who had written about the company, 17 Black Limited, shortly before her death. He has denied the accusation.
The banking officials told Reuters that prior to the murder accusation, Noor Bank had handed Fenech two checks totaling 6.1 million dirhams ($1.7 million) when in April 2019 it closed the accounts established in the name 17 Black.
One official, the acting head of the United Arab Emirates' Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Ali Faisal Ba'Alawi, said the bank had decided to hand back the money, deeming the customer to be ""high risk."" This happened just months after a Reuters investigation had identified Fenech as the owner.
Senior police sources in Malta have told Reuters they are investigating whether 17 Black's activities may have been a potential motive for Caruana Galizia's killing. Fenech denies any wrongdoing.
Noor Bank did not respond to a request for comment.
Dated April 23, 2019, the checks have not yet been deposited. Reuters could not determine why Fenech did not deposit the checks at another bank after Noor returned the funds to him.
Fenech declined to say whether he owned 17 Black when Reuters published its story in November 2018. The two checks in his name are the first documented evidence that connects him to the company. His lawyers did not respond to requests for comment on the two checks.
Eight months before her death, Caruana Galizia wrote in her blog about 17 Black. She alleged it was connected to Maltese politicians, but no evidence has so far emerged to back up her assertion.
In a telephone interview, Ba'Alawi said the money was released to Fenech because no valid freezing order had been received from any authority, including Malta.
If requested, the cash could still be blocked, he said.
""I can confirm these checks have not been deposited anywhere so everything remains as is,"" he said, speaking after being shown by Reuters copies of the checks issued to Fenech.
Another senior UAE financial official, who declined to be named, also told Reuters the checks were authentic.
""HIGH RISK""
The copies of the checks were passed by an anonymous source to the Daphne Project, a group of media organizations, including Reuters, that has continued some of Caruana Galizia's work and is coordinated by Forbidden Stories, an NGO in Paris.
Registered as an offshore company in the UAE emirate Ajman, 17 Black opened accounts at Noor Bank in 2015, according to correspondence seen by Reuters. In 2017, after Caruana Galizia wrote about it, it was renamed Wings Development Ltd.
Ba'Alawi said the decision to close the accounts was made by the bank.
""The checks you have a copy of, are manager checks, meaning the accounts have been closed because the customer is deemed to be of a high risk and beyond the bank's risk appetite or threshold,"" he said.
In Malta, officials had previously been sharply critical of the UAE. One senior investigator closely briefed on the Caruana Galizia case told Reuters that the UAE's responses to questions about 17 Black had been incomplete and that information was supplied in the form of financial intelligence which, under the rules by which is its shared, could not be disclosed by police in court evidence.
Ba'Alawi said his Financial Intelligence Unit could and would give full permission to Malta to use the intelligence as evidence for a police investigation or court, if Malta made a request.
""In our case, if that consent is sought, we provide that consent,"" he said.
Ba'Alawi added that if any information was lacking ""they have full right to ask for further information.""
In Malta, a spokesman for Ba'Alawi's counterpart, the Financial Intelligence and Analysis Unit (FIAU) said that, under Malta’s system, it was for the police and courts to make additional requests for legal assistance from another country, either to produce evidence that could be used in court or to freeze funds.

The Maltese senior investigator in the case said that legal discussions were ongoing between the UAE and Malta to secure all necessary evidence and seize any funds, if appropriate.

The February 2018 murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova prompted mass demonstrations against corruption that forced the resignation of then prime minister Robert Fico, and the case has dominated Slovakia's civic life since.
Kuciak, 27, and Kusnirova were gunned down in their house outside the capital Bratislava. The killing echoed the murder four months earlier of another journalist investigating corruption in an EU country, Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed in Malta.
Prosecutors say entrepreneur Marian Kocner, the subject of Kuciak's reporting on corruption, had contracted his killing.
Kocner and two alleged accomplices have pleaded not guilty while the fourth suspect has confessed to the shooting, according to public television RTVS, quoting police sources. They face up to life in prison if convicted.
A fifth man has confessed to facilitating the killing and has made a plea deal with prosecutors to act as a witness.
At the Thursday preliminary hearing, judges will either set the date for the main hearing or ask prosecutors for additional evidence.
The case is seen as a test of Slovak police and judicial independence after the investigation exposed business and personal links between Kocner and security officials.
Grigorij Meseznikov from the Bratislava-based Institute for Public Affairs told Reuters: ""The trial will be closely watched at home and abroad by people hoping for closure of events started by murders that triggered protests that led to resignations, including the prime minister, interior minister and police chief.""
""The trial may wrap up the procedural part of the process but Slovaks will seek the symbolic closure of an era that allowed Kocner to grow so strong at the February election,"" he said.
Prosecutors said in August they had extracted tens of thousands messages from Kocner's phone, containing communication with ""representatives of state bodies and the justice system"".
The revelations led to a number of resignations of senior officials in the past weeks, including a deputy parliament speaker, a deputy minister, two prosecutors and a judge. All denied any connection to the murders.
""Kuciak's reporting has led to the police launching several criminal probes into Kocner...it has cost Kocner not only business but also the air of impunity,"" Marek Vagovic, Kuciak's editor from Aktuality.sk news website, told Reuters.
Prime Minister Fico was replaced by a party ally last year and his leftist, socially conservative Smer party still leads the government as it has for 11 out of the past 13 years.
It has seen a slide in support but still tops opinion polls, although a wide group of opposition parties could edge it out of power in the Feb. 29 election.
The United States last week imposed sanctions on six firms owned by Kocner under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuses and corruption."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Tuesday announced sweeping changes to the way the Roman Catholic Church deals with cases of sexual abuse of minors, abolishing the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" that previously covered them.
Advocates for the victims of a sex abuse scandal that has rocked the church for nearly two decades applauded the move as being long overdue but said it had to be applied broadly.
Two documents issued by the pope back practices that have been in place in some countries, particularly the United States, such as reporting suspicion of sex abuse to civil authorities where required by law. 
The documents, which put the practices into universal Church law, also forbid imposing an obligation of silence on those who report sex abuse or allege they have been a victim.
""This is an epochal decision,"" Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta and the Vatican's most experienced sex abuse investigator, told Vatican Radio.
The lifting of ""pontifical secrecy"" in sex abuse investigations was a key demand by Church leaders, including Scicluna and German Cardinal Reinhard Marx, at a summit on sexual abuse held at the Vatican in February.
They argued that secrecy in cases of sexual abuse of minors was outdated and some Church officials were hiding behind it instead of cooperating with authorities.
LOWER LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY
The new rules effectively strip internal Church proceedings, evidence and tribunal decisions of the secrecy protection they previously enjoyed.
This, victims groups have said, will allow for more transparency and sharing of information with authorities while keeping a lower level of confidentiality similar to civil legal structures.
Marie Collins, who was abused by a priest in her native Ireland as a girl and resigned in frustration from a papal commission on abuse because of what she saw as Vatican resistance, Tweeted that the changes were ""Excellent news ... at last a real and positive change.""
Anne Barrett-Doyle, co-director of the U.S. based abuse documentation group BishopAccountability.org, said the pope had taken ""an overdue and desperately needed step"" but that its impact will be determined by how broadly it is applied.
Scicluna said the new provisions open up ways to communicate with victims and cooperate with the state.
""Certain jurisdictions would have easily quoted the pontifical secret ... to say that they could not, and that they were not, authorized to share information with either state authorities or the victims,"" Scicluna said.
""Now that impediment, we might call it that way, has been lifted, and the pontifical secret is no more an excuse,"" he said.
One of the documents also raises to 18 or under from 14 or under the age that pictures of individuals can be considered child pornography ""for purposes of sexual gratification, by whatever means or using whatever technology"".
Last year, a Vatican court sentenced a Catholic priest to five years in jail for possessing child pornography while he was based in the United States as a diplomat.
On Tuesday, the pope accepted the resignation of Archbishop Luigi Ventura, the Holy See's ambassador to France, who has been accused of sexual molestation. 
The Catholic Church has been hit by scandal involving the sexual abuse of children by priests around the world in the past 20 years. Francis has vowed zero tolerance for offenders but victims of abuse want him to do more and make bishops who allegedly covered up the abuse accountable.

PARIS (Reuters) - French trade unions crippled transport, shut schools and brought hundreds of thousands of demonstrators into the streets on Tuesday in a redoubled effort to force President Emmanuel Macron to ditch a planned pension reform by Christmas.
Unions had called the mobilization hoping to regain momentum after one of the biggest waves of strikes and protests in decades had started to tail off in recent days. While it was too early to say whether they would match the 800,000 demonstrators brought into the streets two weeks ago, the strike appeared to have been observed on a similar scale.
In Paris, shops were shuttered along the protest route. Riot police lined both sides of the central Boulevard Beaumarchais and had erected a barricades across the traffic circle in Bastille Square (NYSE:SQ). A water cannon truck was parked nearby.
""We want social justice,"" said Veronique Ragot, 55, a striking sub-editor at a publishing house. ""We've seen our social benefits melt in the sun, and this is the last straw.""
Union transport workers chanted ""All together, all together, yes, yes!"" as they gathered in central Paris. Protesters in high visibility jackets carried burning flares through the streets.
A broadcaster showed clouds of what its reporter described as tear gas fired on protesters in the western city of Nantes.
Former investment banker Macron aims to streamline the Byzantine state pension system and prod people to work until 64, instead of the average retirement age now of 62.
The strike forced most long distance trains, commuter trains and Paris metro lines to shut. Even the Eiffel Tower was closed. Many state schools were shut or had reduced lessons. Grid operator RTE blamed the strike for power outages in Lyon.
In the morning, roads were thick with pedestrians, bicycles and electric scooters as people headed to work.
Official figures suggested the number of railway workers participating in the strike had gone up, although the number of teachers had gone down.
The unions and Macron are each hoping to push the other to back down before Christmas, with the prospect that strikes over the holiday would alienate an increasingly frustrated public.
PRIVILEGES
""Democratic and union opposition to our project is perfectly legitimate. But we have stated clearly what our project was, and my government is totally determined to reform the pensions system and to balance the pension system's budget,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told parliament.
Opponents of the pension reform were buoyed by the departure of government pension reform tsar Jean-Paul Delevoye, who quit on Monday over his failure to declare other jobs.
French workers receive among the world's most generous state pensions through a system divided into dozens of separate schemes. Macron's government argues that privileges for various categories of workers make it unfair, and wants a ""points"" system to treat contributions from all workers equally. Unions argue this amounts to an attack on hard-earned benefits.

""When all the unions say 'We do not want this reform', the government should have a rethink,"" said Philippe Martinez, head of France's CGT union, leading a column of demonstrators in Paris's Republic Square. ""They need to open their eyes and unblock their ears.""

375,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 08:59AM ET</span>",Clashes erupt in Indian capital over citizenship law; Modi rejects criticism,"By Devjyot Ghoshal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Clashes erupted in New Delhi on Tuesday between thousands of protesters and police, the latest violence in a week of opposition to a new law that makes it easier for non-Muslims from neighboring countries to gain citizenship.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says the new law will save religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians from persecution in neighboring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan by offering them a path to Indian citizenship.
But the law does not apply to Muslims, which critics say weakens India's secular foundations.
Police fired tear gas in the New Seelampur part of the capital to push back protesters swarming to barricades and throwing stones. At least two police were injured, a Reuters witness said.
""It started as a peaceful protest against the citizenship bill ... but got out of hand,"" resident Azib Aman said.
Cars were damaged and roads strewn with rocks while small fires on the road sent smoke into the air. Small groups of youth, some with their faces covered, threw stones and bottles.
There have been growing questions about the stance of the government, led by Modi's Hindu-nationalist party, toward India's 172 million Muslims, or 14 percent of the population.
The citizenship law follows the revocation of the special status of the Muslim-majority Kashmir region, and a court ruling clearing the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a mosque razed by Hindu zealots.
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said India's actions in Kashmir and on the citizenship law could drive Muslims from India and create a refugee crisis.
""We are worried there not only could be a refugee crisis, we are worried it could lead to a conflict between two nuclear-armed countries,"" Khan told a Global Forum on Refugees in Geneva.
Anger with the Indian government was stoked this week by allegations of police brutality at Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia university on Sunday, when officers entered the campus and fired tear gas to break up a protest. 
At least 100 people were wounded in the crackdown which has drawn criticism from rights groups.
Modi told a rally for a state election on Tuesday that his political rivals were trying to mislead students and others to stir up protests. 
""This is guerrilla politics, they should stop doing this.""
The most violent protests occurred initially in the northeastern state of Assam, where mobs torched buildings and train stations, angry the law would help thousands of immigrants from Bangladesh become citizens.
Later, the unrest spread to New Delhi and other major cities, driven by concern that Modi was advancing a Hindu-first agenda and that India's Muslims were at risk.

The metro train station near the Delhi protest was closed to prevent more people from arriving. Riot police were deployed and were trying to push the crowd off the main road into side streets and alleys.

The court said the plans could contravene European law and exacerbate existing tensions between Brussels and Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS).
""Contradictions between Polish law and EU law... will in all likelihood lead to an intervention by the EU institutions regarding an infringement of the EU treaties, and in the longer perspective (will lead to) the need to leave the European Union,"" Poland's Supreme Court said in a statement.
The EU has accused PiS of politicising the judiciary since the party swept to power in 2015. Pis says its reforms are necessary to make the court system more efficient.
Under draft legislation now before parliament, PiS aims to prevent judges from ruling that that peers, nominated by a panel appointed by the party, are not independent.
The EU said on Monday it would investigate whether the draft law undermines judicial independence.
The Supreme Court statement also said the proposed bill was ""evidently"" designed to allow President Andrzej Duda, an ally of PiS, to pick a new head of the court before a presidential election expected in May.
The current head of the Supreme Court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, is due to stand down in April. She was appointed before PiS came to power and has been openly critical of the party's reforms.
Gersdorf has called a meeting of all judges for March 17 so they can participate in the process of choosing the next head of the Supreme Court, court spokesman Michal Laskowski told a news conference on Tuesday.
Moves by Hungary and Poland to bring their courts and media under tighter state control have led the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, to begin rule-of-law investigations that could in theory lead to a suspension of their EU voting rights.
Brussels is considering tying adherence to the rule of law and democratic standards with access to EU budget funds.
Poland joined the EU in 2004 and public support for membership remains strong, despite the tussles between Brussels and PiS. Poland is a major beneficiary of EU funds for its farmers and infrastructure projects.
There is no mechanism for the EU to expel a member state. So far only Britain has chosen to leave the bloc, following a referendum in 2016. It is expected to exit the EU next month."

The 61-year-old Bishop of Chelmsford in eastern England will replace John Sentamu, who is retiring, and become the Church of England's second most senior clergyman behind the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Cottrell has been outspoken in his support for women clergy and has said everyone is welcome in the Church regardless of their sexuality.
He said he looked forward to being ""a voice for the North"" and helping to address the discrepancies of wealth and opportunity that often favor the South of Britain.
Ordained in 1985 after a brief stint in the film industry, Cottrell began his ministry in southeast London before moving to the dioceses of Chichester in southern England and Wakefield in the North.
He replaced the openly gay priest Jeffrey John as bishop of Reading in 2004 after John was pressured to step down by then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams (NYSE:WMB).
Cottrell then went on to become bishop of Chelmsford in eastern England, a role he has held since 2010. 
In April, he co-signed a letter opposing a proposed service at Westminster Abbey to celebrate 50 constant years of patrols by the UK's nuclear deterrents, saying there was no circumstance in which they should ever be used. 
Sentamu, Britain's first black archbishop, welcomed Cottrell's appointment, saying he has ""the Gospel in his belly and a tiger in his tank"".

378,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 08:25AM ET</span>",Spain's Sanchez promises dialogue on Catalonia if wins confirmation vote,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez agreed on Tuesday to meet with Catalonia's pro-independence regional head provided that the national parliament confirms him as premier - a vote in which separatists are likely to play a crucial role.
According his office, Sanchez told Catalan president Quim Torra in a telephone conversation that he would try to promote dialogue and reduce tension should he form a government after months of political stalemate and two inconclusive elections this year.
The overture marks the first time Sanchez and Torra have talked after the Socialist premier refused on various occasions in October to answer Torra's calls, saying that he had failed to condemn the at times violent separatist protests in Barcelona.
Protests erupted in October after Spain sentenced nine separatist leaders to long prison sentences for their role in a failed bid for independence in 2017.
The resumption of contacts comes at a time when Sanchez's political future appears to hinge on Catalan separatists.
His Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) has been negotiating with the pro-independence leftist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) - which is not Torra's party - to ask for its abstention vote in the confirmation ballot.
Left-wing ERC has conditioned its support in setting up a negotiation between the Spanish and Catalan government on the independence issue in the wealthy northeastern region.
So far no deal has been reached, but one of ERC's demands was for Sanchez to call Torra as a goodwill sign.
The Socialists have struck a coalition deal with left-wing Podemos. It favors dialogue with Catalonia and, unlike the Socialists, supports a referendum on independence.
But both parties combined have only 155 seats in the 350-seat house, giving ERC's 13 lawmakers a potential kingmaker role in unblocking the political stalemate.
Sanchez and Torra have not met since about a year ago and talks between both governments collapsed in February.
In his call, Sanchez said he would address the situation in Catalonia, where society is almost split in favor and against independence.
""The will...is to find a response to this political crisis,"" his office said in a statement.
Torra defended the right of self-determination and the freedom of the jailed leaders as the solutions needed.
Sanchez plans to talk this week with the leaders of Spain's 17 regions. After the potential investiture vote, he also seeks to hold bilateral meetings and then a summit with all of them, as well as to improve the regional financing system, his office said."

Now he is setting his sights on the Paralympics.
Four years after reaching Greece on a journey that took him from war-torn Mosul to Athens via Turkey, Sami is hoping to bag a spot to compete in fencing at Tokyo 2020.
Sami, who was left with a permanent limp in his right leg after a medical mistake at an Iraqi hospital when he was three, has spent the past two years training to be a wheelchair fencer.
He has competed internationally this year and is now hopeful he could be selected. The Paralympics, as well as the Olympics, have had a refugees team since the Rio Games in 2016.
""I am just following my dreams,"" Sami told Reuters. 
Sami spent six months living in a tent in a refugee camp on the island of Samos before moving to the mainland with support from the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. 
A project by Greece's Paralympic Committee for refugees caught Sami's eye in 2017 and since then he has been developing his sabre skills at a gym.
""It gives me more excitement and I feel more strong,"" said Sami, who used to work as a photographic designer in Mosul.
Sami's coach Leonidas Koukos, who is also aide to the head coach of the Greek Paralympic team, said that as a player, Sami, 29, was quick and determined.
""He was watching the movement the opponent was making and the next exact moment he was making the counter movement,"" said Koukos. ""This is very, very good. This is his best skill.""
Sami competed in the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation Wheelchair fencing world cup in Warsaw in July and there are plans for him to compete in Italy and Hungary to give him additional exposure to competitions.
The International Paralympic Committee gives wild cards to refugees to compete in a refugee team under the IPC flag. 

""If I train more this helps me go to Tokyo,"" Sami said. ""This is the best moment for me.""

Maria Butina, 31, pleaded guilty in a U.S. court last December to one count of conspiring to act as an agent for Russia by infiltrating a gun rights group and influencing conservative activists and Republicans.
She was deported in October after serving most of an 18-month sentence and met with fanfare in Moscow where officials had called the charges against her ridiculous and said she had been forced to confess.
""Well, I'm home now,"" Butina says with a grin and wearing a ""foreign agent"" T-shirt in a promotional clip for the show aired on Tuesday.
The show is called Wonderful Russia Bu Bu Bu, a play on words mocking a similar slogan by prominent Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny who talks of the ""Wonderful Russia of the future"" when President Vladimir Putin is no longer in power.
""Bu bu bu"" roughly translates as ""blah blah blah"". But ""bu"" is also the beginning of the word for ""future"".
RT said Butina had taken part in the show last week and defended the jailing of several Russian opposition activists at anti-Kremlin protests earlier this year.
Russia's human rights commissioner last month gave Butina a job helping campaign for and defend Russians who have been imprisoned abroad.
Putin has in the past warmly welcomed home alleged Russian agents arrested abroad and said in 2010 he had sung patriotic songs with Anna Chapman, a Russian spy arrested in the United States and then freed as part of a major swap.
Chapman herself later received a job as a television presenter on Russia's privately owned Ren TV channel.
Officials in Moscow say RT, which broadcasts news in English, Arabic and Spanish, gives Russia a way to compete with the dominance of global media companies based in the United States and Britain, which they say offer a biased world view.
But critics say the channel functions like a propaganda arm of the Russian state, an assertion the station rejects."

DEBARK, Ethiopia - Rahmat Hussein once inspired fear and respect for the watchful eye she cast over her Ethiopian neighborhood, keeping files on residents and recommending who should get a loan or be arrested.
Now she is mocked and ignored.
Her fall - from being the eyes and ears of one of Africa's most repressive governments to a neighborhood punchline - illustrates how Ethiopia's once ubiquitous surveillance network has crumbled.
""My work is harder now,"" she said, wistfully. ""People don't listen anymore.""
Rahmat worked for a system set up by the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition in the early 2000s, officially to help implement central policies across the country of 105 million people.
But the system, which detractors say was twisted into a tool to silence government critics, began to unravel with the outbreak of deadly protests in 2015 which undermined the EPRDF's authority. 
The election of reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has vowed to make society more open and took office in April 2018, has accelerated its decline.
That has been welcomed by many.
""People were afraid and could not speak up,"" said Agenagnew Abuhay, Rahmat's colleague at a local women's affairs office.
Others, like Rahmat, mourn its loss, saying the network drove advances in health, education and agriculture.
It is widely acknowledged among Ethiopians as having played a significant role in society, although many are still too nervous to speak openly about it.
Some officials and academics question whether Abiy can control a restive population, amid outbreaks of deadly ethnic violence, and deliver promised economic and political reforms without the system he has allowed to fray.
""The local administration is collapsing in some places,"" said one civil servant in the capital Addis Ababa, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak with journalists.
""The government doesn't seem to have much control.""
Abiy holds regular public meetings and is active on Twitter, said an official in the prime minister's office, when asked how he would communicate with people now the old network has weakened. Most Ethiopian households do not have the internet. 
The prime minister's spokeswoman referred Reuters to the civil service commission for comment. 
Its head, Bezabih Gebreyes, said the system was formed for the ""noble rationale"" of development but acknowledged that ultimately it had been a failure.
""The structure was very active for at least five years,"" he told Reuters. It failed, he said, because workers did not like taking orders from political appointees. 
""ONE TO FIVE""
Stacked on top of Rahmat's kitchen cabinet in the town of Debark, 470 km (290 miles) north of Addis Ababa, are a dozen bulging folders detailing the lives of 150 neighbors: who has money troubles, who has HIV, who is caring for an orphan and who is hosting a stranger.
The 27-year-old kept a copy of her handwritten notes and delivered duplicates to a local government office, which crunched the numbers and reported them upwards.
""It made me very happy to do this work,"" she told Reuters one cold morning, as she cooked bean stew in her one-room home. ""I did it to serve the people."" 
Rahmat, wearing a lemon-yellow headscarf, said she helped women seeking a divorce understand their rights, arranged for a fellow single mother to get a loan to start a café and ensured families had cards for subsidized staples like oil and sugar.
If there were strangers in the neighborhood, she reported them to police.
Rahmat was more than a neighborhood fixer. She was a loyal party member, encouraging residents to join the EPRDF and promoting its policies at monthly meetings.
She was also part of a network of millions of people in cities and villages, universities and workplaces.
The system was popularly called ""one-to-five"", because volunteers would typically be assigned five other people to monitor. Some, like Rahmat, supervised more.
The work was unpaid, but there were rewards. Rahmat got a government job. Others received preferential access to farming supplies or loans, she and other participants in the system say.
The government used the system to drive rapid agricultural and industrial reforms, aimed at transforming a mostly rural society dogged by famine into a middle-income country by 2025.
Volunteers taught farmers how to space their seedlings and use fertilizer, promoted safe birthing practices and kept track of rabble-rousers.
The system was also used ""for surveying the population and to intimidate any kind of opposition,"" Lovise Aalen, an Ethiopia expert at Norway-based research institute CMI, wrote in a 2018 paper.
Some former and current officials and aid groups credit ""one-to-five"" for helping Ethiopia achieve development goals.
The system helped reduce maternal mortality, said former health minister Kesete Admasu, in a report on the Gates Foundation website.
Volunteers acted as ""model families"", gathering women over coffee, or at church or in mosques, to promote family planning and hygiene.
Maternal deaths fell by 11% from 1990 to 2003, the year the system was put in place. The rate plunged by more than half over the next eight years, Kesete said.
Over a third of the network's maternal health groups, called The Women's Development Army, have stopped functioning, said a ministry official working on women's affairs, laying out a spreadsheet. Reuters could not independently verify the figure. 
""It is very difficult to maintain such structures in a democratic system,"" said Elshaday Kifle, a lecturer at Addis Ababa University who is studying the impact of such networks on women. ""That's a challenge for Abiy's government.""
TESTING LOYALTY
The system permeated Ethiopians' lives, dictating behavior in homes, offices, clinics and schools, Aalen said. 
Volunteers tested people's loyalty at meetings, reporting those with anti-government views. Consequences could be serious.
In 2014, Gizachew Mitiku Belete, then a 29-year-old judge in the northern city of Gonder, attended a course in the central city of Adama.
He sat in a hotel conference room as several dozen judges took turns to praise the constitution or government policies, in what he described as a test of loyalty under the ""one-to-five"" structure.
Gizachew went rogue, suggesting judges could disagree with parts of the constitution. The group leader shouted at him.
For the next year, he publicly criticized the government for suppressing free expression, but he was fired in 2015 and sought asylum in the United States. He eventually found work as a security guard in Seattle, where he still lives.
Judges, journalists, even farmers could be detained if they crossed the system.
Former policeman Fenta Marelgn said he was ordered to arrest farmers who did not attend a meeting on planting seeds in 2015 because they were busy harvesting crops.
Fenta, now 31, said he was docked a month's pay for refusing the order. He quit shortly afterwards.
""You start to hate what you do,"" he said, crushing a metal bottle top between his hands. 
For years, government officials had trumpeted relentless progress. Barley and wheat production always beat forecasts. Vaccination campaigns reached every village.
""We lied left and right,"" former information minister Getachew Reda told Reuters. ""That's why people got angry.""
The system began to disintegrate in the tumultuous years of protests that propelled Abiy to power in April 2018.

Since that time, Rahmat's dossiers have been gathering dust.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's biggest Muslim groups have denied that lobbying by Beijing, including tours facilitated by China in Xinjiang, had influenced their stance on the treatment of the region's Muslim Uighur minority.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions in Xinjiang as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs. Indonesia has not been as outspoken about the Uighurs as it is on other issues seen as important in the Muslim world, such as the fate of Palestinians.
Abdul Mu'ti, secretary general of Indonesia's second-biggest Muslim group, Muhammadiyah, denied it had received donations from China during a tour in February to Xinjiang it participated in, and said it opposed ""all kinds of human rights violations, everywhere done by anyone toward anyone.""
The Wall Street Journal in a report last week described the tour as part of a campaign to convince Indonesia's religious authorities and media that re-education camps in Xinjiang were a well-meaning bid to provide job training and fight extremism.
In a news conference on Monday, Mu'ti described as ""baseless"" any assertions that the views of the group had been influenced after visiting the region.
Savic Ali, website director of Indonesia's biggest Islamic group, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), also denied the group was influenced by Beijing.
Indonesia is the world's biggest Muslim-majority country and NU and Muhammadiyah claim to have about 120 million members between them.
""NU does not have a special relationship with China and NU's international position isn't influenced by scholarships or visit invitations,"" he said, adding NU did not have complete information on the situation of Uighurs in Xinjiang.
Indonesia's foreign ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah said Indonesia did express its views on Xinjiang to China.
""It doesn’t necessarily have to involve megaphone diplomacy,"" he said in a text message.
The Chinese government's top diplomat State Councillor, Wang Yi, had discussed the situation in Xinjiang with Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi on the sidelines of an Asia-Europe meeting on Monday in Madrid, Faizasyah said.
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Jakarta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China is Indonesia's biggest trading partner and a major investor and financier of some infrastructure projects.
Aaron Connelly of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Singapore said Indonesia would be wary about antagonizing China over Xinjiang because of concerns it ""could damage perceptions of Indonesian non-alignment amidst U.S.-China rivalry, or lead China to reduce investment."""

President Xi Jinping is overseeing a sweeping plan to refurbish the armed forces by developing everything from stealth jets to anti-satellite missiles, as China ramps up its presence in the South China Sea and around self-ruled Taiwan.
The carrier, the country's second, began sea trials last year from its base in Shandong province in the northern port of Dalian, where it was built, and has now been given the official name the Shandong, state media reported, following its commissioning.
Xi oversaw the ceremony at a naval base in Sanya in the southern island province of Hainan, a major facility on the coast of the South China Sea, where China has constructed man-made islands, to alarm around the region and in Washington.
Xi boarded the ship, chatting with its crew and offering his ""affirmation"" for China's success at building its own carrier, state media said.
Xi was accompanied by two close political allies, the report added - Vice Premier Liu He who has been leading trade talks with the United States, and Zhang Youxia, one of the two vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission which is in charge of the armed forces and which Xi heads.
Last month the ship, still unnamed at the time, sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on its way to what China called routine exercises in the South China Sea.
Taiwan, claimed by China as its sacred territory and gearing up for elections in early January, denounced the move, saying Beijing was trying to intimidate it.
China has been using the Liaoning mainly for training, as the navy hones its ability to operate fighter jets at sea and with other warships.
Unlike the U.S. Navy's longer-range nuclear carriers, both of China's feature Soviet-design ski-jump bows, intended to provide sufficient take-off lift for fighter jets. They lack the powerful catapult launch technology U.S. carriers have.
State media have quoted experts as saying China needs at least six carriers. The United States operates 10 and plans to build two more.
Most experts agree that developing such a force will be a decades-long task for China, but progress on a home-built carrier boosts prestige for Beijing, seen by many experts as keen to eventually erode U.S. military prominence in the region.
Satellite images show the construction of a new, much bigger carrier is progressing steadily alongside expansive infrastructure work that analysts say suggests the ship will be the first of several large vessels produced at the site.
The images of the Jiangnan shipyard outside Shanghai were taken in September and provided to Reuters by the non-partisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, building on satellite photos it obtained in April and September last year.
China's military has not formally announced plans for the third carrier, but official state media have said it is being built.
It is expected to be China's first carrier with a flat deck and catapult launch system, allowing the use of a wider range of aircraft and more heavily armed fighter jets.
China's first two carriers are relatively small, accommodating only up to 25 aircraft launched from ramps built on their decks. U.S. carriers routinely deploy with nearly four times that number."

386,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 06:22AM ET</span>",Thousands of Thai fishermen protest against tough industry regulations,"By Patpicha Tanakasempipat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Several thousand Thai fishermen protested outside the agriculture ministry on Tuesday over strict regulations aimed at combating illegal and unregulated fishing which they say are driving them out of business.
Thailand, one of the world's largest seafood exporters, began cracking down on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing four years ago after the European Union threatened to ban its seafood exports. 
The EU lifted its threat in January this year, citing a ""major upgrade"" in Thai governance, but the reforms enacted by Bangkok in 2015 have hurt the country's fishing sector. 
The protesters, drawn from 22 provinces around the country, turned the area in front of the ministry into a camp site with makeshift shelters under colorful umbrellas and took turns to air their grievances over megaphones. 
""We've lost everything in the past five years. If we don't get any answers today, we won't leave,"" said one fisherman from the southern province of Rayong.
Mongkol Sukcharoenkana, president of the National Fisheries Association of Thailand (NFAT), said the reforms and costly fines had caused many fishermen to lose their jobs. 
""If the government won't fix the problems for us, we'll just oust them,"" Mongkol told Reuters. 
Earlier this month, fishing associations drew up a list of demands that included a relaxation of the restrictions and the allocation of special funds to help the industry. 
Alongkorn Ponlaboot, an adviser to the agriculture minister, told the gathering on Tuesday that a loan of 10.3 billion baht ($341 million) for the fishermen and a scheme worth 7.1 billion baht ($235 million) to buy out 2,700 ships were awaiting cabinet approval. 
But he said amending the law was complicated because it could affect Thailand's commitment to combat IUU fishing, and that consultations were ongoing. 
""DARK DAYS"" 
Thailand's multi-billion-dollar seafood sector came under scrutiny after investigations showed trafficking and exploitative practices against workers on fishing boats. 
International organizations have welcomed Thailand's reform of its fishing sector, saying it has bolstered traceability and oversight on transshipments at sea and curbed forced labor. 
Steve Trent, executive director of London-based Environmental Justice Foundation, urged Thailand to entrench the reform rather than water it down. 
""If NFAT gets its ways and the reforms are rolled back, it will be a return to the dark days of violence, forced labor, more illegal and unsustainable fishing,"" Trent told Reuters. 
Alongkorn told Reuters the government would not do anything that would negatively affect Thailand's IUU status. 
""We have an obligation and we don't want to turn back. That's the bottom line.""

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar authorities detained 173 ethnic Rohingya aboard a boat off the southern coast, authorities said on Tuesday, amid signs that more members of the Muslim minority group are making perilous sea voyages to escape persecution.
The navy seized the vessel carrying the group, including 22 children, in Tanintharyi Division’s Kawthaung township on Sunday, said military spokesman Tun Tun Nyi.
“Our navy found them on a suspicious boat in the sea,” he told Reuters by phone. “The police will proceed according to the law.”
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar to Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a military-led crackdown that U.N investigators have said was carried out with “genocidal intent” and included mass killings and rapes.
Some 600,000 remain in largely Buddhist Myanmar, confined to camps and villages in the western Rakhine state where they are unable to travel freely or access healthcare and education.
For years, Rohingya on both sides of the border have boarded boats organized by smugglers in the dry months between November and March, when the sea is calm. The dangerous journey to Thailand and Malaysia, often undertaken in overcrowded, rickety vessels, has cost many lives.
The exodus peaked in 2015 when an estimated 25,000 people crossed the Andaman Sea, many drowning in unsafe and overloaded boats. But smuggling has continued.
Myat Thu, assistant director of Kawthaung township’s administrative office, said it was not yet clear whether the group arrested on Sunday set sail from Myanmar or Bangladesh.
“Now we keep them at an island in Kawthaung in the sea, with security guards,” he told Reuters by phone. “We are making sure that all of their human rights are protected.”
Bangladesh coast guard official Saiful Islam told Reuters they were unaware of any boats leaving the camps for Myanmar.
“If we had such information, we would have stopped them,” he said by phone.
More than 90 Rohingya including 23 children found on a beach in the Irrawaddy delta region after boarding a boat from Rakhine appeared in a Myanmar court on Dec. 11 to face charges of traveling illegally.
Hundreds have been imprisoned in jails and youth detention centers across the country.
“It shouldn’t be that way,” Muslim leader Wunna Shwe, joint-secretary of the Islamic Religious Affairs Council in Myanmar, told Reuters.
“The government must examine their citizenship and grant citizenship to those who are eligible. It will be difficult to solve this issue without recognizing the rights of the people in the existing camps.”"

SEOUL (Reuters) - A proposal by China and Russia to ease U.N. sanctions on North Korea increases pressure on the United States and signals what is the likely end of unified efforts to persuade Pyongyang to give up its growing nuclear and missile arsenal. 
On Monday China and Russia proposed that the United Nations Security Council lift a ban on North Korea exporting statues, seafood and textiles, and ease restrictions on infrastructure projects and North Koreans working overseas, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters.
The plan comes at a crucial moment - just weeks before the deadline set by North Korea for Washington to offer more concessions - and highlights deepening divisions over how to engage with North Korea.
Russia and China, which both wield veto power on the Security Council, were key votes in imposing the sanctions in recent years under the ""maximum pressure"" campaign championed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
The United States says it would be premature for the U.N. to consider lifting sanctions right now and has called for North Korea to return to the negotiating table.
Since North Korea and the United States established a detente in 2018, however, both Moscow and Beijing have increasingly voiced support for easing sanctions. Now, the official proposal represents a new level of public pressure on the United States, analysts said.
Last week, China's ambassador to the U.N. said a major cause of the deadlock and rising tensions was a failure to respond to ""positive steps"" taken by North Korea toward denuclearisation.
""The Russia-China initiative at UNSC is likely coordinated with Pyongyang as the proposal reflects North Korea's demands to be rewarded for the concessions it has already taken,"" said Artyom Lukin, a professor at Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok. ""Pyongyang's recent threats of escalatory action are now backed by the Sino-Russian diplomatic offensive.""
China and Russia are effectively undercutting the United States’ current strategy on North Korea, he said. ""Pyongyang has again demonstrated its unrivalled capacity to exploit rivalry between great powers.""
China hopes the U.N. Security Council forms a consensus on the draft resolution, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday, urging North Korean and the United States to keep talking.
South Korea, which is a close U.S. ally but which has also expressed willingness to ease some sanctions as part of a deal with North Korea, said on Tuesday sanctions could only be eased through a consensus among Security Council members and called for diplomatic efforts to be focused on resuming talks.
Other analysts noted Beijing and Moscow have shown increasing unity on the issue of security on the Korean peninsula.
Sanctions relief is crucial for both China's Northeast Area Revitalization Plan as well as Russia's economic interests in the Russian Far East, said Anthony Rinna, a specialist in Korea-Russia relations at Sino-NK, a website that analyses the region.
""Recently the Chinese government has stated that sanctions relief for North Korea is imperative, and Beijing has a much higher chance than Moscow of being taken seriously in Washington,"" he said. ""Furthermore, sanctions are a part of the joint Sino-Russian action plan for peace on the Korean Peninsula."" 
The call to lift sanctions affecting rail infrastructure and foreign workers, for example, are two areas that are key economic interests for Moscow, Rinna added.
ECONOMIC LEVERAGE
North Korea has set a year-end deadline for Washington to make concessions like easing sanctions. Otherwise, leader Kim Jong Un has said he may be forced to choose an unspecified ""new path"".
China and Russia appear concerned about what North Korea's next steps may be, and the call for sanctions relief is a way to try to avoid a return to the nuclear weapons tests and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches that led the two countries to join the United States and its allies in imposing the strict sanctions, analysts said.
""Moscow generally feels that pressure is the wrong track to take with North Korea, yet if Pyongyang engages in more provocations in the coming year this could be a serious test for both China and Russia's tolerance of North Korea,"" Rinna said.
China, meanwhile, appears to be wielding ever-greater economic clout over North Korea.
A recent report by a South Korean trade association found China's proportion of the North's overall external trade rose to 91.8 percent last year, compared with 17.3 percent in 2001. Thousands of Chinese tourists provide a further, much-needed economic lifeline. 
Behind the scenes, there are reports that unofficial trade between China and North Korea has also increased.
""This could give Pyongyang pause if they're pondering a hardline approach for next year"" said Andray Abrahamian, a visiting scholar at George Mason University Korea. ""That said, they traditionally have pushed back hard against supposed Chinese leverage, aware that China is willing to punish North Korea, but not to the point that it causes real instability.""
Daniel DePetris, a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington-based think tank, said he hopes Russia and China teaming up could keep Kim restrained for the time being. 

""We don’t know what China and Russia’s red-lines are, but it’s reasonably safe to assume another ICBM or nuclear test would force both countries to recalculate its current position,"" he said.

Halim Fidai, governor of Khost province where the incident took place, said the family was on their way to a neighboring province when their vehicle struck the device planted on the main road.
Some 18 civilians were wounded in a similar incident in northern Balkh province, said Adil Shah Adil, provincial police chief spokesman.
Although there is a winter lull in fighting due to heavy snowfall in the mountains, when militants use colder months to rest and regroup ahead of annual spring offensive, roadside bombs continue to be deployed across parts of the country.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham visited Kabul on Monday after U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad renewed talks with the Taliban this month on steps that could lead to a ceasefire and a settlement of the 18-year-long war.
Graham said that U.S. troops abandoning Afghanistan would be a ""strategic mistake"", despite the recognition that numbers could be cut.
""To reduce our forces this coming year is possible. The Afghan security forces are getting more capable and as they achieve capability, the number of U.S. forces necessary can go down,"" Graham told a news conference in Kabul.
U.S. officials have said U.S. forces in Afghanistan could drop to 8,600 and still carry out an offensive, counter-terrorism mission as well as advising Afghan security forces.
There are currently about 13,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan as well as thousands of other NATO troops.
Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians, security forces and 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed in conflicts since austere Taliban rule toppled in late 2001.

Azilah Hadri and another police officer, who were serving on Najib's security detail at the time of the murder, were sentenced to death in 2015 for killing 28-year-old Altantuya Shaariibuu.
Najib, who lost a general election last year and is also facing charges of corruption on a massive scale, has denied knowing the woman, but the question of who ordered the killing has never been answered.
Azilah, in a court filing seeking to set aside his conviction, said Najib had ordered him to ""arrest and destroy"" Shaariibuu, who the former premier had allegedly described as a foreign spy, news portal Malaysiakini reported on Monday.
""I asked (Najib) what he meant by arrest and destroy the foreign spy, he responded: ""Shoot to kill"", and indicating it with a 'slit the throat' gesture,"" Azilah said, according to Malaysiakini.
Azilah's lawyer J. Kuldeep Kumar on Tuesday confirmed the report, but declined to comment further.
Malaysia's Federal Court will hear Azilah's application on April 20.
Najib denied the allegations and accused the Malaysian government of using Azilah to orchestrate a political attack against him.
""I have been told that this new tale will provide a way for the government to arrest and imprison me without bail, as no bail is allowed for murder cases,"" Najib said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Shaariibuu was shot dead and her body was blown up by military grade explosives in a forest near Kuala Lumpur.
Civil society groups have alleged her murder was linked to her role as an interpreter for Abdul Razak Baginda, a former associate of Najib, in Malaysia's purchase of two submarines from French shipbuilding giant DCNS in 2002.
Abdul Razak, who said he had had an affair with Shaariibuu, was acquitted of abetting the murder in 2008.
Sangeet Kaur Deo, a lawyer for Shaaribuu's family, called for a fresh probe into her death in light of Azilah's latest allegations.
""The question was always who was behind it,"" she told reporters.
""That was a question that hopefully will be answered now with the right investigations.""
Azilah's co-accused, Sirul Azhar Uma, fled to Australia shortly before his sentence was handed down.
Sirul said last year he would cooperate with any new investigation into the murder if he was given a full pardon."

Ankara has cracked down on suspected followers of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, since the July 2016 coup attempt in which some 250 people were killed. Operations against the network are still routine.
Burak Oguz, the mayor of Urla district in the Aegean coastal province of Izmir, is the first local authority from the CHP to be arrested since elections in March.
Separately, Ankara has removed 28 co-mayors from the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) due to alleged links to Kurdish militants. Twenty-two co-mayors have been arrested since August and 19 remain in pre-trial detention, according to the HDP.
Deniz Yucel, head of the CHP's Izmir provincial group, said on Twitter that Oguz had been arrested and rejected the accusation that the mayor belonged to any Gulen network.
""There is no chance for FETO to survive within the CHP,"" he said, using a word that commonly refers to the network. The party condemns the judiciary removing from office those who were elected, he said.
The Urla municipality did not immediately comment.
Gulen has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. He has denied any involvement in the coup attempt.
In the three years since the attempt, more than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial and about 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from their jobs.
Turkey's Western allies and rights groups have criticized the scale of the crackdown, saying President Tayyip Erdogan has used the abortive coup as a pretext to quash dissent.
Ankara has defended the measures as a necessary response to the scale of the security threat Turkey faces, vowing to eradicate Gulen's network."

Hong Kong has been embroiled in more than six months of anti-government protests which show no sign of abating. Police have arrested 6,060 people since the unrest began, with 977 charged with various offences including unlawful assembly, common assault and criminal damage, as of Dec. 12.
The ages of those arrested range from 11 to 84, according to police. Police do not say how many of them are in detention.
On the weekend, a line of people waited at the entrance of the train station in the Mong Kok district to drop off their cards at a booth manned by volunteers and equipped with screens showing videos of clashes with police. 
Bonnie Lock, a 52-year old housewife, dropped off her card with a crowd of her neighbors. 
""As Christmas and Chinese New Year approach, I want to show some support, to let them know that we, the peaceful protesters ... miss them very much,"" Lock said.

The protesters are angry about what they see as an encroachment by China on wide ranging autonomy Hong Kong was guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" framework which governs the former British colony.
China has rejected the complaints.

Protests are scheduled to continue across the city through the rest of the week and into Christmas.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As dusk fell on Sunday, police smashed their way into the main library of New Delhi's Jamia Millia University, firing tear gas shells as scores of terrified students barricaded doors and hid inside bathrooms to protect themselves.
Video footage shot by a student inside the library and reviewed by Reuters shows dozens of young students - including several women - scrambling for cover, cowering beneath desks, and jumping over metal and broken glass dividers as they attempted to flee.
More than 600 students sought shelter inside the building as violence raged around the university in southeast Delhi, after thousands gathered to protest a controversial new citizenship law that has sparked days of violent unrest.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government insists the Citizenship Amendment Act is necessary to help persecuted minorities from Muslim-majority Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who settled in India before 2015.
But the move has triggered a severe backlash, with widespread clashes in the country's north and a rash of protests across universities - including in Jamia.
On Sunday, some protesters set buses alight and battled stick-wielding policemen on a major thoroughfare nearby. 
In a statement, the student community of Jamia said they disassociated themselves from the violence, which was perpetrated by some elements to discredit their peaceful protests. 
Asad Malik, a lecturer in Jamia's law department, said school officials had stood by the campus gates, checking ID cards to ensure only students entered the nearly 100-year-old public university amid the chaos on Sunday. 
However, police said some vandals did manage to enter the Jamia and officers only followed them into the campus after they were pelted with stones from inside the university.
""Miscreants and rowdy elements had entered the university and police went inside the campus chasing this crowd, to pull them out,"" M.S. Randhawa, a police spokesman told reporters on Monday.
Malik, however, said when police started shooting tear gas inside the university, there were only students inside. 
Saliha P.P., a 22-year-old masters student, said she was on the Jamia campus when she saw more than 100 policemen storm the campus, fire tear gas and charge students with batons.
""There were continuous sounds of tear gas,"" she said. ""They were just beating any students they saw so cruelly."" 
On Monday morning, sections of university library lay in ruins. Windows were smashed, chairs lay broken and scattered. Crushed glass covered corridors and tables. 
Reuters witnesses saw tear gas shells and blood splattered on the library floor. At least two surveillance cameras had been smashed.
Jamia's Vice Chancellor Najma Akhtar said police had entered the campus without permission, injuring around 200 students. The university, which has a large number of Muslim students, plans to seek a government enquiry into the violence. 
""The brutality with which they behaved with students is not acceptable,"" she told media on Monday.
At least five students told Reuters they did not see any women police personnel among the force that stormed the campus, as is required by law in India when females are on the scene.
A police spokesman did not respond to respond to multiple requests for comment on the allegations of brutality or the reported absence of female officers. 
'DEATH IS ON THE OTHER SIDE'
Madiha Aziz, a postgraduate student, was on the first floor of the library, sitting under a desk in the darkness after other students switched off the lights.
""We thought we will be safe inside the library, the college authorities will protect us,"" she said, speaking with Reuters at her home a few kilometers away from Jamia.
From a window, looking down, Aziz said she saw dozens of police pounce on students and beat them up. Three other students also told Reuters they had seen police thrash students in and around the library. 
Petrified, some tried to barricade themselves inside using library cupboards. 
""The police beat us a lot, they did a lathi charge inside the library,"" said law student Mohammad Anas, using the Hindi word for a baton.
With tear gas canisters exploding inside, second-year student Mohammad Shahzad said some ran to the washrooms to hide or wash their eyes with water. 
""But police dragged them out and beat them up,"" he said.
Some bathroom doors inside the library building lay smashed on Monday, seemingly kicked in from the outside.
Still cowering under a desk, Aziz thought it was all over, when police stormed in after banging loudly on the doors.
""I thought my death is on the other side,"" she said. ""It was a night of horrors."" 
It was after 7 p.m. local time when police began clearing the library building, said three students who had sought refuge inside.
""Outside the central library staircase around 200 students were asked to sit down. Then we were asked to keep both our hands on our heads and we were asked to get out,"" Anas said.
Others, who sought shelter in surrounding buildings, met a similar fate.
Hisham Siddiqui, a doctorate student, said he was inside a mosque on the university campus when more than a dozen police burst in.
""They smashed the glass doors and entered inside,"" he said, heavily bandaged and seated in a wheelchair outside Alshifa hospital late on Sunday night.
After being beaten and falling unconscious, Siddiqui said he managed to hobble out, before being taken to a hospital.
""Our faith is strong, we will continue fighting,"" he said, as he was wheeled out of the hospital.
Others were left shattered though, and many students were seen wheeling suitcases and leaving the campus on Monday.
""I'm a student here. I study law here. I was to answer an exam on the constitution today, but what's left of it?,"" Anugya Jha told media as she was leaving the campus on Monday.

""What constitution do I go back and study now? Have they left any of it?"" said Jha, tears streaming down her face. ""I do not feel safe in this entire country anymore. I do not know where I may go and be lynched today, by the police itself.""

397,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 02:22AM ET</span>",Number of U.S. executions and support for capital punishment decline in 2019: report finds,"By Brendan O'Brien
(Reuters) - The number of executions carried out in the United States dropped in 2019 and public support for the death penalty fell to nearly a five-decade low, according to a report released on Tuesday.
Twenty-two executions were carried out during the year, down from 25 in 2018. Texas conducted nine executions, while Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia conducted three apiece in 2019. 
It was the fifth straight year with fewer than 30 executions, marking a sharp decline from 52 in 2009, the Death Penalty Information Center said in its annual report. 
It was also the fifth year in a row with fewer than 50 death sentences handed down, a steep decrease from the 118 imposed in 2009, said the non-profit organization that collects data on the death penalty in the United States. 
Support for capital punishment dropped to a 47-year low as 60% of Americans told a Gallup poll they preferred life imprisonment over the death penalty. In 2014, the last time the poll asked the question, 45% of Americans said they preferred life over the death penalty, the report said.
Public support for the death penalty was driven down as the guilt of several condemned inmates in high-profile cases came into question in 2019, said Robert Dunham, the center's executive director. 
""2019 came close to being the year of executing the innocent,"" he said in the report. ""Our courts and public officials too frequently flat out ignore potentially deadly mistakes, and often take steps to obstruct the truth.""
One such case was that of Rodney Reed, who was scheduled to be executed on Nov. 20, two decades after he was convicted and sentenced to death in Texas for the killing of his 19-year-old lover. After questions arose about evidence in the case and calls for Reed's exoneration grew more intense, a Texas appeals court halted his execution. 
The final execution in the United States this year took place last Wednesday when Texas put to death Travis Runnels, who was convicted of killing a prison supervisor.
The year also saw two states taking action against the death penalty. California imposed a moratorium on executions and New Hampshire became the 21st state to abolish the death penalty.
In announcing reprieves to all 737 inmates on death row and closing California's execution chamber, Governor Gavin Newsom said the death penalty discriminated against poor and minority defendants and those who suffer from mental illness.
""Our death penalty system has been, by all measures, a failure,"" said the Democratic governor of the most-populous U.S. state.

Plans by President Donald Trump’s administration to resume federal executions in December after a 16-year hiatus were dashed by a U.S. judge who halted the scheduled executions of four inmates on death row. In early December, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision.

Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, any country can claim exclusive economic zone up to 200 nautical miles from their shoreline. China, however, claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $3.4 trillion worth of goods are transported every year.
As a result, Malaysia said in its submission dated Dec. 12 that there were areas of potential overlapping claims https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/mys85_2019/20171128_MYS_ES_DOC_001_secured.pdf beyond its own exclusive economic zone.
China said Malaysia's submission had ""seriously infringed on China’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the South China Sea"", the South China Morning Post said quoting a diplomatic note sent by China to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
""China has historic rights in the South China Sea,"" the Hong Kong newspaper quoted China's permanent mission to the United Nations as saying in the note.
Malaysia's foreign ministry, the Chinese embassy in Kuala Lumpur and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to queries from Reuters.
Malaysia and Vietnam in 2009 made a joint submission for a portion of the two countries' continental shelf in the southern part of the South China Sea.
A senior Vietnam official said last month it could explore legal action, among various options, in its territorial dispute with China over the waters.
On Tuesday, Vietnam said it hoped China would show restraint in the South China Sea next year after a Chinese oil survey vessel and its escorts spent months within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone in what Hanoi called a blatant violation of its sovereignty.
Vietnam, the region's most forceful challenger of China's extensive maritime claims to the busy waterway, will take on the rotating chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2020.
The U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf said Malaysia's partial submission on the northern part would be included in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session to be held in New York in 2021.
Malaysia had been critical of China's South China Sea position but has been less outspoken recently, especially after China pumped billions of dollars into infrastructure projects under its Belt and Road Initiative.
But Malaysia's foreign minister said in October the country needed to boost its naval capabilities to prepare for possible conflict in the South China Sea."

Vietnam, the region's most forceful challenger of China's extensive maritime claims to the busy waterway, will take on the rotating chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2020.
""I hope that during our chairmanship China will show restraint and refrain from these activities,"" Vietnam's deputy foreign minister, Nguyen Quoc Dung, said at a lecture at The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.
""What China did is very alarming and also kind of threatening not only Vietnam but also other countries that see the potential of being threatened in the future,"" he said.
China's claims within its so-called ""Nine-Dash Line"" in the South China Sea are a source of friction with ASEAN members Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei as well as with the United States.
But China's closest allies within the Southeast Asian bloc have historically opposed taking tougher words or action against China, which is nonetheless negotiating a code of conduct with regional states.
The Vietnamese minister said it wasn't that other ASEAN countries supported China's actions, but that they did not protest in the same way.
More than $3 trillion a year in trade pass through the waterway, which also has oil and gas reserves and historic fishing grounds for the surrounding countries.
The Chinese oil survey vessel Haiyang Dizhi 8 left Vietnam's extended economic zone in late October after more than three months there. Beijing said it had been carrying out a scientific survey in Chinese-controlled waters."

Lucas Sturrock was home alone on Sunday after his father and brother had gone out to fight a fire in Mogumber, 128 km northwest of Perth, Western Australia, when the blaze approached his house.
Realizing the fire was approaching too fast to escape to the rendezvous point designated by his father, Sturrock grabbed the family dog and headed off in his older brother's pick-up truck, police said.
Emergency workers found Sturrock and the dog in the truck at the side of a road, unharmed.
""It was great he had the driving skills to get out of there,"" Police Sergeant Michael Daley told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).
""It is fantastic we found him and got him out of danger.""
Ivan Sturrock, Lucas' father, said his son had learnt to drive when he was seven.
""We taught him to drive since he was about seven just in case things like this do happen and I was quite proud of him, he did exactly what we told him to do,"" Ivan Sturrock told the ABC.
Lucas Sturrock is one of thousands of Australians that have been forced to flee their homes amid a devastating national bushfire crisis that has seen authorities struggle to contain hundreds of blazes.
The fires have killed six people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland, and conditions are expected to deteriorate this week.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 11:31PM ET</span>",Ecstasy on the barbie: Australia seizes more than half a tonne of drugs smuggled in barbecues,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian police have arrested two men for allegedly smuggling 645 kilograms (1,422 pounds) of ecstasy hidden inside hundreds of aluminum barbecues, the culmination of a six-month investigation spanning three countries.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Australian Border Force (ABF) said it had charged a 30-year-old man from Queensland and a 33-year-old Canadian national over their involvement in the criminal enterprise. At well over half a tonne, the haul of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, is the biggest shipment by weight seized in Australia this year.
The investigation remains ongoing and is expected to lead to further arrests, the ABF said. Police didn't disclose the names of the two men held, who each face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment if convicted.
The case began in July when police in the Cyprus Drug Law Enforcement Unit tipped off ABF counterparts about a potential large shipment of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, in a container shipping from Limassol and bound for Sydney. The investigation also involved the United Kingdom National Crime Agency, the ABF said.
On searching the container, the police found 200 aluminum barbecues, many with false base plates concealing multiple packages of the drug.
Officers swapped the MDMA for an inert substance and delivered the barbecues to a warehouse in Sydney, where it sat for more than three months.
Starting in late October, the barbecues were gradually shipped to another warehouse, also in Sydney, where the Australian suspect began to prepare the drugs for distribution, the ABF said.
The Canadian suspect arrived in Sydney last week to visit the warehouse and was arrested in Brisbane on Monday.
""It will be alleged in court that he acted as a liaison for the criminal group responsible for importing the MDMA,"" the ABF said.
The Australian suspect was also arrested on Monday, while about A$300,000 ($204,000) in cash and 3.5 kg of cocaine were also seized. 
The arrests come as the ABF invests heavily in new technologies allowing officers to see further into shipping containers than ever before, ABF Regional Commander for New South Wales, Danielle Yannopoulos, said in the statement.
""Just this year we've found illicit substances in professionally manufactured car parts, fridges, furniture, and even an excavator,"" she said.

403,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 11:28PM ET</span>","Hong Kong needs to do more to stop violence, resolve problems: government","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's chief secretary, Matthew Cheung, said on Tuesday he was disappointed with recent protest violence after a period of relative calm, as the Asian financial hub geared up for more anti-government demonstrations in coming days.
Cheung, speaking at a weekly press briefing, was referring to a protest on Sunday during when police fired tear gas in late night street clashes - the first time tear gas had been used in nearly two weeks.
""The work of stopping the violence has not yet been completed, we need to keep working on it. At the same time, we need to put effort on resolving deep rooted problems,"" Cheung said.
His comments came after the city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, met Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday. 
Xi offered Lam his support and praised her courage in governing the city during the ""most difficult times"" of often violent anti-government protests. 
Lam, who is due back in Hong Kong on Tuesday, also met Premier Li Keqiang during her regular duty visit to Beijing.
""Hong Kong right now has not stepped out of its dilemma,"" Li said, according to remarks broadcast by Cable TV, as he urged Lam's administration to end the violence.
""The ... government should make continuous efforts to bring the violence and chaos to an end in accordance with the law and restore order"".
He also urged the government to address ""deep-rooted issues in the economic and social development of Hong Kong"" to ensure stability and prosperity in the region.
The financial hub has been embroiled in more than six months of anti-government protests which show no sign of abating.
Protests are scheduled across the city on Tuesday as well as through the rest of the week and into Christmas.
Protesters are angry about what they see as an encroachment by China on wide ranging autonomy Hong Kong was guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" framework which governs the former British colony and the neighboring casino hub of Macau.
China has rejected the complaints and blamed other countries, including the United States, for inciting the protests.
Xi is due to begin a three-day visit to Macau on Wednesday and security has been tightened. There have been no protests in the former Portuguese colony.
SECURITY MATTER
While the number of protests and the violence have eased in Hong Kong in recent weeks, the pro-democracy movement retains broad public backing, with families and older people coming out to recent demonstrations. 
They are calling on the government to listen to their demands which include an independent investigation into police behavior and the implementation of full universal suffrage.
The trigger for the protests was a proposed extradition law, that would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be prosecuted in mainland courts. The bill, which the city later dropped, raised concern about what many Hong Kong people see as the undermining by Beijing of their freedoms.
The recent arrest by mainland security officials of a Hong Kong resident at a checkpoint on a newly opened bridge linking Hong Kong with Macau and the mainland city of Zhuhai has stirred new concerns.
Media reported the 53-year-old suspect was detained on Friday while traveling to Macau on a bus.
Cheung, asked about the arrest, said the matter was beyond the city's control and related to security matters on the mainland.
""It's perfectly justified for them to exercise jurisdiction within their own territory, it's entirely legal and justified,"" he said.
Mainland police said the person detained was part of a mobile phone smuggling syndicate. 
Hong Kong residents have been on heightened alert to citizens disappearing over the border into mainland China since five city booksellers went missing in 2015. All later appeared in detention in China, with some showing up in video footage making what appeared to be forced confessions.

A former British consulate employee in Hong Kong said in November that Chinese secret police beat him in an attempt to force him to give information about activists leading pro-democracy protests.

The official death toll from the surprise eruption on White Island, also known by its Māori name of Whakaari, stands at 16. Six bodies were retrieved from the island on Friday.
Those still missing, presumed dead, are Winona Langford, a 17-year old Australian, and Hayden Marshall-Inman, a 40-year old New Zealand tour guide. Their bodies are believed to be in the waters around the island.
""I know that every effort is being made...weather is currently conspiring against them and that is a very dangerous environment in which they are working,"" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne told reporters in Auckland during a visit to meet with officials following the eruption.
The dead include 11 Australian citizens, three Australian permanent residents and one New Zealander. One other person, whose name has not been released, died after being transferred to an Australian hospital.
There has been growing criticism that people were allowed on the island, a popular destination for day-trippers, given the risks of an active volcano. That has led to speculation the tragedy could lead to major changes for New Zealand’s thrillseeker tourism industry.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that official inquiries by coroners and work safety regulators into the eruption could take up to a year, and will carry potential criminal penalties of up to five years in jail. 

She is seeking advice from officials on whether a broader investigation is needed.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Her timing can be terrible and she can pack a mean punch.
But ""Little Miss Period"" - a pink blob with red lips and red pants who stars in a Japanese manga comic and movie of the same name - has a mission: breaking taboos in a society where talking about menstruation has been seen dirty or embarrassing.
The character has generally been received positively as a step toward better understanding among the sexes. Some critics, though, worry about stereotypes and inattention to underlying gender discrimination that holds back Japanese women in many fields.
""Until now, menstruation has been something to hide and many people completely lack correct understanding of it,"" said Kazue Muta, a sociology professor at Osaka University.
""I can't praise the manga 100% ... but it would be good if it were a step toward greater openness and education.""
The movie ""Little Miss Period"" was released domestically by entertainment company Yoshimoto Kogyo Co. Ltd last month. It is based on a manga by male artist Ken Koyama that debuted in 2017 before being compiled into a book by publisher Kadokawa.
The film also opened in Taiwan this month and will debut in Hong Kong in January. Premieres in China and across Southeast Asia are also planned.
The topic of menstruation caught public attention in Japan recently when department store Daimaru suggested female employees wear a ""period badge"" to alert co-workers to their cycle. The plan sparked accusations of harassment and the store is reconsidering.
In the manga series, Little Miss Period - ""Seiri-chan"" in Japanese - delivers a punch to the gut that lays some women out flat before drawing blood with a syringe. When a woman's husband fails to sympathize, he gets a ""period punch"" of his own to help him understand. 
History gets a nod, with the tale of a feudal era Japanese girl forced to stay in a secluded hut because of the belief that menstruating females are unclean.
The movie version focuses on Aoko, a publishing firm editor whose male boss shows little compassion for her monthly pain. Aoko's widower boyfriend is raising a young daughter. ""If only men could get periods, even just once a year,"" Aoko laments.
Feminist author Minori Kitahara welcomed efforts to break taboos but lamented that the representations were ""treating the matter like a comedy talk show.""
Nobuyoshi Yoshida, 33, said he found the movie instructive. ""Men don't get how harsh menstruation can be for some women,"" he said as he exited a cinema. ""This was easy to understand.""

His girlfriend Kumiko Hanazawa, 32, was succinct: ""I want men to watch this.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Firefighters in Australia warned on Tuesday they would not be able to contain some of the 100 fires still ablaze in the country before conditions are expected to deteriorate later this week.
Temperatures across parts of the eastern state of New South Wales (NSW) are expected to top 40 degree Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, just shy of a record high for Australia's most populous state.
With bushland tinder-box dry, authorities warned locals near existing blazes that fires could spread.
""People should be under no illusion, we won’t contain the fires by the time the weather deteriorates later this week,"" NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers told Australia's Channel 9.
""People need to brace themselves in those areas for what’s potentially to come.""
Firefighters are battling more than 120 fires across NSW, including a 60 km (37.2 miles) firefront northwest of Sydney, one many of that have been burning since November.
The fires have killed six people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland.
While the bulk of the blazes have been concentrated across Australia's east coast, hot weather has ignited firefronts in other parts, stretching authorities to the limit.
In Western Australia, cooler weather has eased the earlier threat of fires, authorities said.
Escalating wildfires threaten to blanket Sydney - home to more than 5 million people and better known for its clear skies and blue harbor - in smoke and ash again.
Haze in recent weeks had turned Sydney's daytime sky orange, obscured visibility and prompted many commuters to wear breathing masks as air quality plunged to hazardous levels not previously seen in the city.
Bushfires are common in Australia's hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires last month in the southern hemisphere spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland extremely dry.
The crisis has also put pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who critics say has not done enough to address the impact of climate change.
Morrison has defended his government's policies, but some former firefighters chiefs say Australia must abandon its existing strategy that puts the main responsibility for extinguishing blazes in the hands of state and territory governments.
""Business, as usual, doesn't work and we need a roundtable to get that sort of thinking with all agencies involved,"" Peter Dunn, former Emergency Services Authority commissioner in the Australian Capital Territory, told reporters in Sydney."

ABOARD A U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Monday that he needed to speak with his Turkish counterpart to understand how serious President Tayyip Erdogan was when he said he could shut down the Incirlik air base, which hosts U.S. nuclear warheads.
Erdogan's warning on Sunday that he could close Incirlik came in response to threats of U.S. sanctions and a separate U.S. Senate resolution that recognized mass killings of Armenians a century ago as genocide.
""It has not been brought up to me before. The first I heard of it was reading it in the papers as you just mentioned and so I need to talk to my defense counterpart to understand what they really mean and how serious they are,"" Esper told reporters. 
Turkey could also close the Kurecik radar base, Erdogan added on Sunday. 
Esper said that if Turkey was serious about closing down the Kurecik base, it would have to be discussed by NATO.
""They are a sovereign nation to begin with, so they have that inherent right to house or to not house NATO bases or foreign troops,"" Esper said.
""But again, I think this becomes an alliance matter, your commitment to the alliance, if indeed they are serious about what they are saying.""
Last week, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution that recognizes as a genocide the mass killings of Armenians a century ago, a historic move that infuriated Turkey and dealt a blow to the already problematic ties between Ankara and Washington.
The U.S. Congress has been united in its opposition to Turkey's recent policy actions. Republican senators have been incensed with Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system, which the United States says poses a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and cannot be integrated into NATO defenses.
They have also moved to punish Turkey over its Oct. 9 incursion into Syria. A U.S. Senate committee backed legislation on Wednesday to impose sanctions on Turkey, pushing President Donald Trump to take a harder line on the issue.
""I think the issue here is once again what is Turkey's direction with regard to the NATO alliance and the actions they are taking on any number of issues,"" Esper said.
NATO diplomats worry that Turkey, a NATO member since 1952 and a critical ally in the Middle East, has increasingly acted unilaterally.

""We see Europe as an important cooperation partner and a priority on our diplomatic agenda,"" Wang Yi, a state councillor who also serves as foreign minister, said on Monday during a visit to Europe, according to the state news agency Xinhua.
China has been ramping up its efforts to improve ties with the European Union and countries including Russia and Japan as trade and political relations with the United States have deteriorated.
Wang's comments on his trip to Europe, which included an Asia-Europe foreign ministers' meeting in Spain, came just days after Beijing and Washington agreed a preliminary trade deal.
The so-called Phase One deal suspended a threatened round of U.S. tariffs on $156 billion of Chinese exports that was scheduled to take effect on Sunday. However, while U.S. officials have touted the deal, Chinese officials have been more cautious, emphasizing that the trade dispute has not been completely settled.
Speaking at a think tank in Brussels, Wang said China was not an economic rival of the European Union and should not be treated as such.
""In fact, any cool-headed person with an objective view will see that, for China and the EU, cooperation far outweighs competition, and our areas of consensus far exceed differences. We are partners, not rivals,"" he said.
At the foreign ministers' meeting in Spain, Wang said China was opposed to a ""technology blockade and digital hegemony.""
""China is also against creating technological divide,"" Xinhua quoted Wang as saying.
The U.S. government has blacklisted several Chinese tech companies in recent months, and has sought international support for its ban of the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], citing security risks. The company denies its gear poses a threat."

SEENIGAMA, Sri Lanka (Reuters) - When Kushil Gunasekera returned to Seenigama in Sri Lanka's Galle district days after it was wiped out by a massive tsunami on Dec. 24, 2014, he got to work.
Houses had collapsed, bodies floated in the sea water that had invaded inland, and one in four residents of the community of about 1,200 people had been killed by the deadliest tsunami to sweep across the Indian Ocean in decades.
The wall of water triggered by a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Indonesia’s Sumatra island had killed more than 230,000 people across the region. Indonesia bore the brunt, but Sri Lanka was the next worst-affected country with about 40,000 dead.
Fifteen years on, Seenigama has risen from the ruins, in large part because of Gunasekera's efforts to re-build his ancestral village about 110 km (68 miles) from Colombo.
Once a successful businessman in Sri Lanka's lucrative sugar trade, the 63-year-old has rebuilt homes, taught vocational skills to young people and pushed them to take up sports - in short, he has helped breathe life back into the village.
""Everything was ruined to rubble within the matter of a few minutes. But the good thing is we were able to turn the setback into a blessing,"" Gunasekera told Reuters.
With the help of cricket stars like Muttiah Muralitharan and Kumar Sangakkara, Gunasekera has raised funds for a charity which now has an annual budget of over $1 million and a beneficiary list of more than 28,000 people.
The Foundation of Goodness charity has recruited dozens of specialists to run a kindergarten, provide vocational training and IT skills.
It also runs a training centre at the beach for people who want a professional diving licence, a much sought-after qualification in Sri Lanka's tourism industry.
Seenigama is an outlier compared to the other tsunami-hit villages on Sri Lanka's coast, where locals are still largely dependent on government aid and without sustainable livelihoods.
HAUNTING MEMORIES
Namal Ishari remembers the moment that December morning when she and several hundred other Seenigama residents scrambled up a road and slope at the village temple to escape the tsunami.
With her family's property destroyed and belongings washed away, she said she had little hope her life would ever recover. The sight of the body of her best friend's mother haunted her.
Ishari, 27, is now a team leader at a back-office processing unit for Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings. The unit was set up by Gunasekera's charity, and staff earn more than double what locals typically make in neighbouring villages.
""It (tsunami) was an unbearably painful moment. For many people it was a moment when they lost many things, but for others it was a moment that helped to achieve many things in their lives,"" Ishari said at her modern, well-equipped office.
After the success of Seenigama, Gunasekera is now replicating the model across nine other locations in Sri Lanka, including areas in the north and east that were ravaged by a decades-long civil war.
""Five years down the line, I want to see this expanding to 20 (locations) and the foundation becoming self-sustainable,"" Gunasekera said."
410,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 07:50PM ET</span>","China, Russia propose lifting some U.N. sanctions on North Korea, U.S. says not the time","By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China and Russia on Monday proposed the U.N. Security Council lift a ban on North Korea exporting statues, seafood and textiles, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters, in a move Russia said is aimed at encouraging talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
The draft also called for a ban to be lifted on North Koreans working abroad and the termination of a 2017 requirement for all such workers to be repatriated by next week. The draft would also exempt inter-Korean rail and road cooperation projects from U.N. sanctions.
It was not immediately clear when or if the draft resolution could be put to a vote in the 15-member Security Council. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, Russia or China to pass. 
""We're not rushing things,"" Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told Reuters, adding that negotiations with council members would begin on Tuesday. He said the sanctions they had proposed lifting were ""not directly related to the North Korea nuclear program, this is a humanitarian issue."" 
A U.S. State Department official said now was not the time for the Security Council to consider lifting sanctions on North Korea as the country was ""threatening to conduct an escalated provocation, refusing to meet to discuss denuclearization, and continuing to maintain and advance its prohibited weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.""
The sanctions on industries that Russia and China have proposed lifting earned North Korea hundreds of millions of dollars and were put in place in 2016 and 2017 to try and cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. 
The United States, Britain and France have insisted that no U.N. sanctions should be lifted until North Korea gives up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pyongyang has been subject to U.N. sanctions because of those programs since 2006.
""On North Korea, as in the past, it's very important that the council maintains unity,"" German U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said on Monday.
Concerns were growing internationally that North Korea could resume nuclear or long-range missile testing - suspended since 2017 - because denuclearization talks between Pyongyang and Washington have stalled. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since June 2018, but no progress toward has been made and Kim has given Trump until the end of 2019 to show flexibility. North Korea's U.N. envoy declared this month, however, that denuclearization was off the table. 
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
The State Department official said Trump remained committed to making progress using diplomacy. 
Nebenzia said the draft resolution was aimed at encouraging talks between the United States and North Korea. ""That's the whole idea, we don't do this resolution in spite, we really want to facilitate,"" he added.
The draft welcomes ""the continuation of the dialogue between the United States and the DPRK at all levels, aimed at establishing new US-DPRK relations, building mutual confidence and joining efforts to build a lasting and stable peace on the Korean Peninsula in a staged and synchronized manner."" DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
It also calls the so-called six-party talks between North Korea, South Korea, China, the United States, Russia and Japan to be resumed or the launching of ""multilateral consultations in any other similar format, with the goal of facilitating a peaceful and comprehensive solution through dialogue.""
Russia and China have long said the Security Council should reward Pyongyang after Kim pledged in 2018 to work toward denuclearization. 
At a council meeting on North Korea last week - called by the United States - China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said sanctions should be adjusted to ""head off a dramatic reversal"" of the situation.
The draft resolution circulated to the Security Council by Russia and China said the sanctions would be terminated ""with the intent of enhancing the livelihood of the civilian population.""
Pyongyang was famous for building huge, socialist-style statues, which it exports mainly to African countries. Some analysts estimated that North Korea had made tens of millions of dollars selling such statues. 
It also made millions of dollars from seafood. A U.N. diplomat said in 2017 that North Korea had been expected to earn some $295 million from seafood exports that year. 
Textiles were North Korea's second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Nearly 80% of textile exports went to China, according to Chinese customs data.
The wages of workers sent abroad also provided foreign currency for the Pyongyang government. A U.N. human rights investigator said in 2015 that North Korea was forcing more than 50,000 people to work abroad, mainly in Russia and China, earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council will meet at China's request on Tuesday to discuss the situation in the disputed Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir, diplomats said.
The council will meet behind closed doors for the first time since a similar gathering in August, which was also called by Pakistan ally China, after India removed the decades-old autonomy the area enjoyed under the Indian constitution.
In a letter to the Security Council on Dec. 12, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi expressed concern about a possible further escalation of tensions.
""In view of the seriousness of the situation and the risk of further escalation, China would like to echo the request of Pakistan, and request a briefing of the Council ... on the situation of Jammu and Kashmir,"" China's U.N. mission wrote in a note to council members, seen by Reuters.
Diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the meeting was scheduled to take place on Tuesday.
The Himalayan region has long been a flashpoint in ties between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan, with both claiming Kashmir in full but ruling it in part. U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed since 1949 to observe a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir.
For decades, India has battled insurgency in the portion it controls. It blames Pakistan for fuelling the strife, but Pakistan denies this, saying it gives only moral support to non-violent separatists.
The Security Council adopted several resolutions in 1948 and in the 1950s on the dispute between India and Pakistan over the region, including one which says a plebiscite should be held to determine the future of mostly Muslim Kashmir.
Another resolution also calls upon both sides to ""refrain from making any statements and from doing or causing to be done or permitting any acts which might aggravate the situation."""

SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez, who had said she was reluctant to take power after her predecessor resigned in disgrace this past summer, on Monday declared her candidacy for the same office in next year's elections.
Vazquez was sworn in as governor in August when widespread protests led to the resignation of Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who was caught up in a scandal over profane chat messages and federal corruption charges against two officials of his administration. 
Vazquez, who served as justice secretary and was in line to succeed Rossello, was also targeted by protesters for alleged corruption and being too close to Rossello.
   On Monday, Vazquez said in a video aimed at voters and released on social media that she would seek election because she had ""decided to continue working for you.""
Vazquez will run under the pro-statehood New Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party. She will face Pedro Pierluisi, a former representative of the commonwealth in the U.S. Congress.
Rossello tapped Pierluisi in late July to become his successor. But Pierluisi was forced out of office a few days later by the territory's Supreme Court, which ruled the selection was unconstitutional.     
    Puerto Rico is still trying to recover from devastating hurricanes that hit the Caribbean island in 2017. It is also working its way through a bankruptcy process to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.
    Since taking office, Vazquez has had a cordial relationship with the island's unpopular financial oversight board, which commenced a form of bankruptcy for the government in federal court in 2017. The board was formed by the federal government.
    In November, she backed legislation to reform Puerto Rico's debt issuance policies and reached an agreement with the oversight board to pay about $60 million in Christmas bonuses to public sector workers.
   Ahead of the announcement of her candidacy, Vazquez signed legislation restoring vacation time and sick leave for government workers that had been cut in 2017.  "

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Using e-cigarettes significantly increases the risk of developing chronic lung conditions such as asthma or emphysema, U.S. researchers said on Monday.
The study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, is among the first to show the potential long-term harms of using e-cigarettes, which are often promoted as a safer alternative to tobacco and a means of helping smokers quit.
It found that e-cigarettes increased the risk of lung disease by a third compared with those who never smoked or vaped. And the risk was even higher among adults who used both e-cigarettes and smoked tobacco.
The research comes as the United States faces a youth vaping crisis. According to the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 27.5% of high school students in the United States use e-cigarettes, up from 20.7% in 2018.
""E-cigarettes are promoted as harmless and they're not,"" Stanton Glantz, director of the University of California San Francisco Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, said in a phone interview.
Glantz and colleagues used data on 32,000 adults surveyed in the CDC's Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH), which tracked e-cigarette and tobacco habits, as well as new lung disease diagnoses from 2013 to 2016.
Nobody had lung disease at the start of the study. Three year later, researchers found that people who used e-cigarettes had roughly a 30% increased risk of developing lung diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared to those who never smoked or vaped.
Those who smoked cigarettes had roughly double the risk of chronic lung disease compared to whose who never smoked. For those who smoked traditional and e-cigarettes, the risk more than tripled, the study found.
""Everybody, including me, used to think e-cigarettes are like cigarettes but not as bad. If you substitute a few e-cigarettes for cigarettes, you're probably better off,"" Glantz said. ""It turns out you're worse off,"" he said. ""E-cigarettes pose unique risks in terms of lung disease.""
Prior studies have only looked at a cross section of the population at a fixed point in time.
The new study is considered more robust because it looks at risks to the lungs over time, Robert Tarran, a physiologist and vaping expert at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said in an email.
""This study adds to the growing body of evidence that demonstrate that vaping is not safe,"" Tarran said."

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's Communist government is prepared if the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump decides to sever diplomatic relations although it hopes that does not come to pass, a top Cuban diplomat said on Monday.
Relations were re-established five years ago this week under former Democratic President Barack Obama following half a century of hostility, a stance that earned the United States lots of goodwill from Latin America, which has been clamoring for such a detente for years.
Washington loosened trade and travel restrictions, Obama visited Havana, and the old Cold War foes looked on track to fully normalizing their relationship.
But under Republican Trump all that has changed. Amid an attack on socialism in Latin America, his administration has not only tightened restrictions, such as banning U.S. cruises again, but even imposed sanctions it had never resorted to before.
It has, for example, allowed U.S. citizens to bring lawsuits against foreign companies deemed to be trafficking in Cuban properties nationalized after Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, damaging investor appetite.
""There are powerful people today in the U.S. government that want to increasingly apply hostile measures and sever our bilateral relationship,"" the Cuban Foreign Ministry's General Director for U.S. Affairs Carlos Fernandez de Cossio told reporters on the sidelines of an annual U.S.-Cuban academic conference in Havana.
""If that were to be the case, we are ready to face that reality, but it is not what the people of Cuba want and not what the government of Cuba is seeking.""
The U.S. says it is pressuring Cuba to end human rights violations such as harassment of opponents of Cuba's one party system. It also wants Havana to stop supporting socialist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
""While there are no plans to break off diplomatic ties at this time, one thing that has clearly reached a low point is the Castro regime’s abuses of its own people,"" a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""In addition, the regime is spreading its totalitarian repression to other countries in the region.""
Havana says the United States does not have the moral authority to lecture anyone on human rights and should not intervene in other countries' domestic affairs.
Analysts say Cuba paradoxically often clamps down more on dissent when it feels under siege from the United States. Activists have complained of an increase in repression of late.

Some believe Trump is eyeing the 2020 election, with the swing state of Florida home to many Cuban-American exiles who welcome the harder line on Havana.

416,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 05:14PM ET</span>",Judge rejects claims by Trump ex-adviser Flynn of FBI misconduct,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday flatly rejected a last-ditch bid by President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn to get the criminal charge to which he already pleaded guilty dropped, brushing aside his claims of misconduct by prosecutors and the FBI.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered Flynn to appear for sentencing on Jan. 28, concluding that the retired Army lieutenant general had failed to prove a ""single"" violation by the prosecution or FBI officials for withholding evidence that could exonerate him.
Sullivan's 92-page ruling represented a major blow to Flynn, who has tried to backpedal since pleading guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn's sworn statements in his plea agreement ""belie his new claims of innocence,"" Sullivan wrote. 
""It is undisputed that Mr. Flynn not only made those false statements to the FBI agents, but he also made the same false statements to the Vice President (Mike Pence) and senior White House officials, who, in turn, repeated Mr. Flynn's false statements to the American people on national television,"" the judge wrote. 
Flynn was one of several former Trump aides to plead guilty or be convicted at trial in then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that detailed Moscow's interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump's candidacy as well as numerous contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia.
The statutory maximum sentence for the charge to which Flynn pleaded guilty is five years in prison.
Flynn's lawyer Sidney Powell, in an emailed statement, called Sullivan's ruling ""as wrong as it is disappointing.""
Flynn was previously supposed to have been sentenced in December 2018, but Sullivan fiercely criticized Flynn and accused him of selling out his country. 
Sullivan had appeared poised to sentence Flynn to prison. The judge instead gave Flynn the option of delaying the sentencing to allow him to fully cooperate with any pending investigations including testifying in the Virginia trial of his former business partner Bijan Rafiekian on charges of illegally lobbying for Turkey.
The plans for Flynn to testify later evaporated. A federal judge in September overturned a jury verdict convicting Rafiekian.
A FALLING OUT
Flynn, who Trump fired in 2017 just weeks after taking office, dismissed his former lawyers and tapped Powell, a frequent Fox News guest who has expressed hostility toward the FBI and Mueller.
Her combative approach caused a falling out with prosecutors, who decided not to call Flynn as a witness in Rafiekian's trial after Powell contended Flynn would not testify to ""knowingly"" submitting false statements to the Justice Department when he retroactively registered as a lobbyist for Turkey.
Powell has filed a flurry of requests with the court to try to force the Justice Department to turn over troves of records that she said would show the FBI conducted an ""ambush"" interview of Flynn and withheld evidence that could exonerate him.
""The court summarily disposes of Mr. Flynn's arguments that the FBI conducted an ambush interview for the purpose of trapping him into making false statements and that the government pressured him to enter a guilty plea,"" Sullivan wrote in the ruling. ""The record proves otherwise.""
Sullivan took aim at Powell in his ruling as well, saying one of the lawyer's legal briefs had plagiarized another source by lifting ""verbatim portions from a source without attribution"" and noted that such conduct violates the District of Columbia's rules for attorneys.
Powell said the judge's accusation of plagiarism was ""unfounded"" because she cited and linked to the brief she was referencing.
The judge's ruling supported the FBI's handling of the Flynn investigation a week after the agency was criticized by the Justice Department's inspector general for the manner in which it handled its applications to a specialized court to obtain a 2016 wiretap of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Sullivan's ruling came a day before another judge is scheduled to sentence Trump's former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates, who also pleaded guilty to charges brought by Mueller. Gates cooperated extensively with prosecutors.

SANTIAGO/LONDON/MADRID (Reuters) - Chile defended itself on Monday against criticism it was too weak in presiding over international climate change negotiations, saying it did all it could but that four big polluting countries got in the way.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera described as ""insufficient"" the agreements reached on Sunday after marathon talks, but said it was not for the host’s lack of trying and criticism of its role was unfair.
""You have to convince 195 countries, and so if just one opposes, there is no agreement,"" Pinera said in comments to local media. When it came to rules governing carbon markets, he said: ""The four big countries didn't accept the proposals.""
Pinera said he personally lobbied other presidents to reach a deal, but would not identify who he called and did not name the countries which he said blocked the deal.
""The countries that pollute the most did not live up to the challenge and remain in debt,"" he said in a subsequent tweet.
Diplomats have listed the Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the United States among those resisting bolder action.
Chile had stepped in to preside over the talks after Brazil pulled out following the election victory of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro. It was then forced to host them more than 10,000 km away in Spain due to unrest at home.
Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, president of the U.N. summit known as COP25, came under fire on Saturday for circulating a draft text that campaigners said threatened to undermine the landmark 2015 Paris agreement on carbon reduction.
""If this text is accepted, the low ambition coalition will have won the day,"" David Waskow of the World Resources Institute, said in the cavernous venue at the time. Greenpeace International said the Chileans were being ""irresponsibly weak"".
Pinera said it was not fair to blame her.
""She did all that was humanly possible,"" he said.
By extending the talks, Schmidt salvaged a face-saving compromise text during late-night discussions. It cited the ""urgent need"" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the Paris agreement to avert catastrophic global warming.
FUTURE CHALLENGES
Schmidt said she was ""sad and pained"" at how nations had failed to find consensus but that the issue of carbon markets - a key sticking point - had tied down the last four summits.
""Neither the will nor the political maturity yet exists from some of the big emitting countries to be able to reach agreement on this,"" she told a news conference.
Laurence Tubiana, Chief Executive Officer of European Climate Foundation, said to win commitments more in line with the warnings of climate science the next host would need to build broad alliances and force those blocking progress to explain themselves openly.
""It means deploying an intensive diplomatic effort right now,"" she said.
Britain will preside over the next summit, which will be held in Glasgow in November 2020.
Challenges include Brazil's insistence on a carbon accounting approach others say is baffling and Australia's insistence on carrying over old credits to meet its Paris emissions targets, which others see as an accounting trick.
Brazil and developing countries, in turn, accused the European Union and other industrialized economies of stymieing progress on financial aid for poorer countries, saying they could not be more ambitious on their climate goals unless they received more assistance.
Chile did manage to coax some governments into joining a new Ambition Alliance of mostly small countries, cities and businesses committed to slashing emissions.
But the world's poorest and most vulnerable nations felt marginalized as Chile tried to force deadlocked major players into a compromise.
Belize's Carlos Fuller, who represented small island states, told Reuters he was forced to assert himself by striding into a side-gathering of delegates from the United States, Brazil and European Union so they would be sure to see him.
""We should have been invited into that room,"" he said.

Tension has been rising in recent weeks, stoking fears the two countries could return to a collision course they had been on before launching diplomacy last year.
U.S. special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, arrived in Seoul on Sunday amid speculation he might try to salvage negotiations by reaching out to North Korea, which has vowed to take an unspecified “new path” if Washington fails to soften its stance before the end of the year.

The lawmakers' parties have denied the charges and denounced the process as another step taken by President Nicolas Maduro's government to dismantle the opposition-controlled national assembly, led by Juan Guaido.
Guaido in January assumed an interim presidency and called for Maduro's removal, though his campaign has lost momentum in recent months and the ruling Socialist Party retains control of the state and military.
The Constituent Assembly, a legislative superbody created by Maduro to override the national assembly, on Monday voted unanimously to approve the trial after a request by Venezuela's top court, which is also stacked with pro-government judges.
It was not immediately evident when the trial would take place.
Chief state prosecutor Tarek Saab, in a statement, said lawmakers Jorge Millan, Hernan Aleman, Carlos Lozano and Luis Stefanelli had conspired to seize military installations in Sucre state with the aim of ""destabilizing this christmas.""
Venezuelan authorities this year have opened criminal probes into Guaido and stripped many of his colleagues of their parliamentary immunity, paving the way for their prosecution.
Guaido says some 30 lawmakers remain detained, in exile, or in refuge at embassies in Caracas.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland will try to repatriate children of Finnish mothers who traveled to Syria to join Islamic State ""as soon as possible"", Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Monday.
Finland is one of a number of European Union member states facing a decision over whether to bring home citizens with IS links who are trapped at the al-Hol camp displacement camp controlled by Kurds in northeastern Syria.
More than 30 children born to 11 Finnish women are at al-Hol, according to Finnish media, and the fate of the mothers has caused divisions in Finland's five-party coalition government that took office last week.
The Centre Party, a coalition ally of Marin's Social Democrats, opposes letting the wives of IS fighters back into Finland but supports repatriating their children.
The Centre Party is worried by the rise in the polls of the opposition nationalist Finns Party, which says repatriating Islamic State detainees could endanger Finland's security.
Marin said that, in an attempt to resolve the dispute in the coalition, the government had decided each case should be judged on its own merits.
""The aim of the authorities' actions is to protect the interests of the child in all circumstances,"" Marin said, leaving the door open for the repatriation of some of the mothers with their children.
""There is no obligation to assist adults who went to the region of their own accord,"" she said.
Repatriating children without their mothers is unlikely to happen as Syrian Kurdish forces, who control the territory that includes al-Hol, oppose separating children from their mothers.
Marin's government faces questioning on the issue in parliament on Tuesday."

ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's right-wing League party, has suddenly dropped his calls for the government to resign and is instead proposing that all the main parties work together to solve the country's most pressing problems.
Salvini's switch from fierce opposition to appeals for collaboration have left many observers puzzled, with some interpreting it as a sign that he is losing hope that the fractious ruling coalition will collapse any time soon.
""Let's sit around a table and find agreement on five priorities for the country: savings, growth policies, justice, infrastructure and health before it's too late, then we can have an election,"" the League chief tweeted on Monday.
Even if it were possible for the parties to find common ground on all these areas it would be a long and arduous process taking months if not years.
In an interview with private television station Canale 5, Salvini added that a new electoral law would also have to be agreed, and said the League was not asking for a role in government while the reform process went on.
The League is Italy's most popular party, with some 30% of voter support, according to opinion polls, but recently Salvini has hit some headwinds and support for his party has flattened out.
A grassroots movement known as ""the sardines"", launched only a month ago in opposition to Salvini, has quickly gathered momentum with a spate of well-attended rallies, and on Saturday tens of thousands joined a demonstration in Rome.
At the same time Salvini is finding it harder to exploit his core campaigning theme of immigration, as migrant arrivals have dwindled and the new government, which took office in September, is managing to re-locate more among other EU states.
""It may be that Salvini has realized that the head of state Sergio Mattarella will never dissolve parliament, so playing nice is the only option left,"" said Francesco Galietti, head of political risk consultancy Policy Sonar.
Italy's new coalition of 5-Star and the centre-left Democratic Party has bickered constantly since it came to power, but it looks set to fulfil its first main task of approving a 2020 budget without friction with the European Commission.
The League chief's call for ""a national rescue committee"" got a cold reception from his far-right ally Giorgia Meloni, head of the Brothers of Italy party, which is growing in support.
""It's an incomprehensible proposal,"" Meloni said in an interview with daily Corriere della Sera on Monday."

The league said the paintings by Italian artist Simone Fugazzotto would be exhibited permanently at the entrance to its main hall ""to underline the commitment of the world of football against all forms of discrimination.""
It said the artwork ""aims to spread the values of integration, multiculturalism and brotherhood"".
Milan-born Fugazzotto, described as being ""known for his disruptive works"", is famous in Italy and almost all his art involves drawings of chimpanzees.
He said he got the idea for the paintings after Napoli's Senegalese defender Kalidou Koulibaly suffered racist insults during a match at Inter Milan last season.
""I got so angry that... I got an idea. Why not stop censoring the word monkey in football but turn the concept around and say instead that in the end we're all apes?,"" he said.
""Because if we are human beings, monkeys, reincarnated souls, energy or aliens who cares. The important thing is to hear a concept of equality and brotherhood.”
Italian football has been plagued by racism with Inter Milan Belgium forward Romelu Lukaku and Brescia's Italian striker Mario Balotelli having been subjected to racist insults from rival fans during matches this season.
A veteran Italian pundit was dropped from a Sunday night round table program after suggesting Lukaku could only be stopped by giving him bananas to eat, while Brescia's president said Balotelli’s problem was that he was “black” and he was “trying to get whiter”.
Both men said their comments were not intended to be taken seriously.
Earlier this month, Italian sports daily Corriere dello Sport used the headline 'Black Friday' along with a picture of Lukaku and AS Roma's England defender Chris Smalling to preview last Friday’s match between their clubs in Milan.
Despite a wave of criticism, the newspaper stood by the headline.
""We know that racism is an endemic and very complex problem, which we will tackle on three different levels,"" Serie A CEO Luigi De Siervo said on presenting the paintings.
""The cultural level, through works such as Simone's, the sports level, with a series of initiatives together with clubs and players, and the repressive level, thanks to the collaboration with the police."""

Mart Helme, 70, Estonian interior minister and leader of the populist far-right party Ekre, on Sunday ridiculed Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, 34, and her government, in which four out of five coalition leaders are women under 35. 
""Now we see how one sales girl has become a prime minister and how some other street activists and non-educated people have also joined the cabinet,"" Helme said on his party's radio talk show.
His comments prompted the opposition to call for his resignation, while Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid asked Finland's President Sauli Niinisto to pass on her apologies to Marin and her government.
Social Democrat Marin, who has spoken about growing up in a disadvantaged family, worked as a cashier before studying at university and embarking on a political career.
""I'm extremely proud of Finland. Here a poor family's child can educate themselves and achieve their goals in life. A cashier can become even a prime minister,"" Marin wrote on Twitter. 
Helme, a former Estonian ambassador to Russia, is known for outspoken statements that regularly embarrass Prime Minister Juri Ratas and his Center Party, Ekre's coalition partner. 
Ekre was accepted for the first time into a government coalition in April, after Ratas lost parliamentary elections but clinched a deal with Ekre to stay in power.
Estonian opposition leader Kaja Kallas said on Monday the opposition would organize a no-confidence vote in parliament if Helme does not resign after his comments about Finland's new leaders. Previous such attempts have failed.

""The interior minister has offended the Finnish government and personally attacked the newly-appointed Finnish prime minister,"" she said in a statement.

The line of snow and icy rain, which has already wreaked havoc in Missouri, has prompted the weather service to issue winter weather advisories from Kansas to southern New England and winter storm warnings from parts of Missouri to Indiana.
""Even though it’s not a major winter storm, it’s enough to make the roads sloppy and snow-packed in cases,” said meteorologist Patrick Burke of the weather service's National Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.
By Monday morning, wintry weather was already blamed for four traffic deaths in Missouri, the state Emergency Management Agency said.
At least 34 flights had been canceled at St. Louis Lambert International Airport on Monday morning and another 25 were delayed, according to FlightAware.
Most of the area affected by the storm will get 1 to 2 inches (3 to 5 cm) of snow, but some parts, including the St. Louis region, southern Illinois and sections of upstate New York could get 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) by Tuesday, Burke said.
The southern side of the storm should produce rain including some locally heavy downpours in Kentucky, West Virginia, Mississippi and Alabama, the weather service said.
The biggest potential for freezing rain will be in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and western Maryland, but the storm also could leave a thin later of ice overnight in the New York City area, Long Island and New England, Burke said.
”If it comes Monday night into Tuesday morning, it could cause some issues for the morning commute on Tuesday,"" he said.

Sherman was 75 and his wife, 70 at the time of their deaths, which stunned the worlds of Canadian business, politics and philanthropy, and drew public condolences from prominent figures including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The case is ""very active"" Idsinga said, but he declined to provide any details of how the investigation is going or what information they have, aside from saying ""we're still combing through a lot of information.""
The private investigator's report is being transferred to police. The Sherman family was not present at the briefing.
The Shermans were found hanging by belts from a railing next to a swimming pool at their Toronto mansion in late 2017, police have said.
Barry Sherman founded Apotex in 1974 and turned it into one of the largest generic drugmakers, earning a reputation for using lawsuits to gain access to sell cheaper generic versions of lucrative branded medicines.
He and his wife were known for their donations to hospitals, universities and Jewish organizations.
The Sherman family has criticized police handling of the deaths and hired a private investigator of their own to look into the case.
Unconfirmed media reports in the immediate wake of the deaths said that police were treating the case as a murder-suicide."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An associate of U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Monday urged a judge to let him stay free on bail while he awaits trial, denying prosecutors' accusations that he lied about receiving a $1 million payment from Russia shortly before he was arrested.
A lawyer for Lev Parnas, who is charged with campaign finance crimes, said the payment was a loan to Parnas' wife, and that it had been disclosed to authorities before his bail was set.
""At no time did Mr. Parnas make a knowingly false statement,"" Parnas' lawyer, Joseph Bondy, said in a filing in Manhattan federal court.
Parnas, a U.S. citizen who was born in Ukraine, was released on bail after his arrest in October and has been living under house arrest in Florida.
Parnas was charged alongside another Florida businessman, Belarus-born Igor Fruman, with illegally funneling money to a pro-Trump election committee and other politicians. Both men have pleaded not guilty.
Last week, prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken to jail Parnas. They said he had concealed information about his finances, including a $1 million payment he had received from an account in Russia in September.
The account was in the name of his wife, Svetlana Parnas. Prosecutors said that was an effort to shield his assets.
The prosecutors said Parnas posed an ""extreme"" risk of fleeing the country, adding that he had ""considerable ties abroad and access to seemingly limitless sources of foreign funding.""
In Monday's court filing, Bondy said that two months of Svetlana Parnas' banking records, including the $1 million payment, had been disclosed to the government.
Bondy denied that Parnas posed a risk of fleeing, adding that Parnas was cooperating with the Congressional impeachment proceeding against Trump and intended to continue doing so.
""Mr. Parnas has strong incentives to remain with his family, to continue to be cooperative with Congress, and to be actively involved in the defense of (this) case,"" Bondy said.
Prosecutors are also investigating payments made to Giuliani, who has not been charged with a crime and has denied any wrongdoing.
Giuliani has emerged as a key figure in congressional impeachment proceedings, in which Democrats have accused the Republican president of abusing his power to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. Trump has called the impeachment a witch hunt.
Giuliani has said Parnas and Fruman worked with him in Ukraine when he was investigating the Bidens."

A spokesman said the 35-year-old had been left ""angry and shaken"" after the burglars apparently evaded both the 24-hour security teams that patrol the street known as ""Billionaire Row"" and Ecclestone's own internal security officers.
The daughter of Formula One's former commercial supremo lives on Kensington Palace Gardens, amongst the residences of the French and Russian ambassadors and close to the Kensington Palace home of Prince William and his wife Kate.
Police said a number of items of jewelry were stolen from a property in West London on Friday night and the suspects had fled the house by the time officers and a dog unit arrived.
The building's security team had reported seeing three males inside the property.
""A fast-paced investigation is underway to locate the suspects and missing items,"" said Detective Sergeant Matthew Pountney. 
The Sun newspaper reported that Ecclestone, a model and celebrity in Britain, had just left the country for her Christmas holidays when the burglars entered the property via the garden and smashed open safes hidden in her bedroom. 
Ecclestone's Instagram feed showed her young daughter boarding a private plane on Friday, with a message saying ""Pretty excited the holidays are here."" 
""I can sadly confirm there has been a home invasion at the Ecclestone-Rutland family home,"" a spokesman said, referring to her husband Jay Rutland. ""Tamara and family are well but obviously angry and shaken by the incident."" 

The average property price for the street stands at 36.5 million pounds, according to online portal Zoopla.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's President Sebastian Pinera sent a bill to congress on Monday to strengthen protections for the country's security forces after two months of unrest that has rattled one of Latin America's strongest economies.
The crisis started over a hike in public transport fares and has left at least 26 dead and thousands injured. It also has sparked fierce internal criticism of the government, as well as by international human rights groups and the United Nations for alleged human rights violations by its police and its army, which was briefly called onto the streets.
Pinera said more than 2,500 police officers had been injured in the unrest, some seriously.
""Our government, as well as categorically condemning all abuses of the human rights of our citizens, also categorically condemns the aggression, mistreatment, humiliation that often affects our police,"" he said while signing the bill.
The draft statute makes attacks on law enforcement officials by rioters an ""aggravated"" offense, with tougher penalties.
It also blocks offenders convicted of such crimes from applying for parole until they have served at least two-thirds of their sentences.
""What we are looking for with this is to recover the due respect our police deserve, but also to give them the protection that they not only deserve but also need to fulfill their important work,"" said Pinera.
The Chilean police said last week it would overhaul its riot squad and was carrying out 856 internal investigations of alleged abuses committed during the protests."

Minister of Cabinet Affairs Martin Elia Lomuro and Minister of Defense and Veteran Affairs Kuol Manyang Juuk were blacklisted for their role in perpetuating the conflict by obstructing the peace process, Treasury said in a statement.
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets held by the officials and prohibit Americans from doing business with them.
Civil war broke out in oil-producing South Sudan in 2013, less than two years after the country gained independence from Sudan following decades of war. The conflict has killed an estimated 400,000 people, triggered a famine and created Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
The latest sanctions come as Washington is reevaluating its relationship with the African nation after South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar agreed in November to give themselves more time to form a unity government.
""We are designating two cabinet-ranking officials in the South Sudanese government for their role in inhibiting political unification, expanding the conflict, and profiting from South Sudan's war economy,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich said in prepared remarks for a speech to non-government organizations (NGOs) and financial institutions on Monday.
Muzinich announced the action at the Partnership to Combat Human Rights Abuse and Corruption, where he said NGOs had provided documented findings that helped support Monday's designations.
Treasury accused Lomuro of recruiting and organizing local militias to attack the opposition forces in South Sudan, and Juuk of failing to remove forces from the battlefield as agreed, stirring up violence with rival tribes and preparing militias for the possibility of renewed violence.
After the devastating five-year civil war, Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in September 2018 to form the unity government by Nov. 12, under pressure from the United Nations, the United States and regional governments.
Days before the deadline, the two leaders agreed to give themselves an extension of 100 days. 
Over 30 days into the extension, the United States has yet to see the government take necessary steps to ""create the political and security conditions conducive to formation of a unity government and adequate implementation of the peace deal,"" Treasury said in the statement.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - An Irish court ordered British journalist Ian Bailey to face an extradition hearing in connection with his conviction in France for murdering a French film producer in Ireland 23 years ago.
Bailey was sentenced in absentia to 25 years in jail by a French court in May for the murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier, whose battered body was found while she was on holiday in the small Irish coastal village of Schull in December 1996.
He has always denied the crime and Irish authorities have never prosecuted him for it. Irish courts have previously blocked his extradition to France, where the law allows suspects to be tried for murdering French citizens abroad.
Bailey was ordered arrested on Monday by the Irish High Court, then immediately released on bail. The court ordered him to appear for an extradition hearing on Jan. 20.
Bailey did not address the court, but told Reuters inside the courtroom that he was glad he was there when his arrest was ordered, so that he could avoid being arrested at home. He said his legal team would challenge the warrant.
The police sergeant who carried out the arrest told the court Bailey had told him: ""I just want to say I had nothing to do with this crime."""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Outraged concert-goers shouting ""revolution, revolution"" hounded former Lebanese prime minister Fouad Siniora from a Christmas concert at the American University of Beirut on Sunday night.
Lebanese politicians past and present have been the focus of weeks of demonstrations demanding the end to a governing elite blamed for years of misrule and Siniora's presence at the concert set off a spontaneous protest.
Siniora, an alumnus of the university, sat impassively on the front row as audience members erupted in chorus against him but eventually bowed to the pressure and left the concert hall with his bodyguards.
""How dare they have the nerve to come to a concert when they know that people hate them. How dare they?"" Terese, a retired teacher, told Reuters. ""We started chanting: revolution, revolution, Siniora get out ... He didn't budge.""
A performance by composer and pianist Guy Manoukian was interrupted by the uproar from the audience though once Siniora had left, the concert began in earnest.
Siniora later sent a tweet saying history would prove that he had always worked in Lebanon's interests though he may have made some mistakes.
Before serving as prime minister from 2005 to 2008, Siniora was a long-time finance minister. He was questioned last month by a state prosecutor over how $11 billion in government funds was spent while he was in power.
His office has said the spending was entirely legal.
Show of irreverence toward senior figures such as Siniora who have long commanded respect has broken taboos in Lebanon, setting the current wave of demonstrations apart from previous dissent.
The presence of Siniora, a former banker and one of the country's wealthy elite, showed indifference to the suffering of many people, some concert-goers said.
""Politicians should understand that they have become distanced from the people,"" said Maestro Barkev Taslakian, conductor of Al Fayhaa Choir.
Many Lebanese politicians have avoided public gatherings for fear of being targeted by angry protesters. One audience member said it was a blatant provocation for of a leading member of the establishment to attend the concert.
""They cannot ignore what's happening and attend and then pretend that actually they are not to blame,"" said entrepreneur Bahe Ghobril.
Others said music should be left out of Lebanon's deepening political divisions and economic woes.
""This is a cultural, artistic event and the revolution should be outside of these doors,"" one of the organizers said during the uproar."

Prosecutors say Marry Mubaiwa tried to unplug Chiwenga's life support tubes in a South African hospital in June.
She was initially arrested on Saturday by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) on charges of fraud, money laundering and breaching exchange control rules, and is accused of illegally transferring $900,000 to South Africa.
She denies all the accusations against her and her lawyer said she would seek bail at Zimbabwe's High Court. She was refused bail for the initial charges after prosecutors argued she would flee the country or interfere with witnesses.
The charges follow media reports that Mubaiwa and Chiwenga, who returned to Zimbabwe last month after four months in a Chinese hospital where he was later treated for a blocked oesophagus, were set to divorce.
Opposition politicians took to social media to accuse Chiwenga of using his position to influence a divorce settlement. Chiwenga could not be reached for comment.
Critics of ZACC say it is conflicted because its head judge, Loice Matanda-Moyo, is married to Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo, a top ally of President Emmerson Mnangagwa and of Chiwenga.
The ZACC denies this and said it will prosecute all corruption cases without fear or favor.
Prosecutors also told the court that Mubaiwa was being investigated for misusing U.S. dollar allowances meant for her husband's security details."
434,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 11:01AM ET</span>",Why should we live like our neighbors? Worker defends France's retirement age,"By Caroline Pailliez
PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron's attempt to make France globally competitive means that Patrick Martine, concierge in a home for the elderly, may have to retire at the age of 63 and four months, not at 62 as he was previously told.
The 57-year-old is not sure he can make it through an extra 16 months being at the beck and call of residents.
""I'm tired,"" Martine told Reuters at one of his CGT trade union's branch offices as comrades planned their next course of strike action against the president's pension reform.
In his early career, Martine worked low-paid jobs in the private sector, including as a nightclub bouncer and driver, often away from home and with little stability. When he reached his 40s, he opted for a public sector job in Paris.
The pay was worse but the concierge job brought income security and the guarantee of a decent pension at 62, the legal retirement age, calculated on the basis of his salary during his final six months working.
Now, he says, Macron is trying to steal that from him.
France has one of the earliest retirement ages among industrialized nations. The president, a former investment banker, says the French should work longer to get a full pension and help plug a big deficit in the pension budget as life expectancies increase.
As part of an overhaul of France's convoluted pension system, his prime minister last week announced a package of bonuses and discounts will be put in place to encourage the French to work until the age of 64 by 2027.
In Britain, by comparison, the state pension age is set to rise to 67 by 2028. In Germany, it is 65 but will increase to 67 by 2029.
Even so, Martine is furious. So too is the hard-left CGT, which is spearheading public sector strikes now in their 12th day and threatening to intensify the industrial action in the build up to Christmas if Macron does not pull the reform.
""Why should we live like that just because our neighbors do,"" Martine said. ""That's why they say the French are a bunch of moaners, because we have perks that we're not prepared to let go of.""
Around a fifth of the workforce is in the public sector, and while the reforms would apply to everyone, it is those jobs that have traditionally offered generous pension terms.
Martine said his tough working conditions - he complained of late night calls and the stress of dealing with elderly residents who had suffered a fall or were going through the onset of dementia - merited retirement at 62.
Under Macron's plan, Martine could still retire at 62 but he would get about 100 euros less per month than he had hoped.
He earns 1,724 euros per month. If he retired at 62, his pension would be 1,208 euros per month. If he retired at the proposed new age of 63 year and four months he anticipates receiving roughly 1,300 euros each month.
""Each reform is a step backwards,"" he said. ""I don't want to retire and have to work to survive financially."""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The European Union should bypass national governments that flout democratic standards and deal directly with municipalities as they can perform ""miracles"" in areas such as climate change, the mayors of four eastern European capital cities said on Monday.
The EU has accused the 'Visegrad Four' nations - the Czech Republic, Slovakia and especially Poland and Hungary - of eroding the rule of law in recent years. It has threatened to suspend the voting rights of Poland and Hungary.
At the launch of a new alliance on Monday aimed at securing more direct EU funding, the mayors of Warsaw, Budapest, Prague and Bratislava said they could spend the money more effectively than their central governments, mostly dominated by euroskeptic nationalists.
""The question is whether Europe can step out of its own shadow and do projects directly,"" said Gergely Karacsony, a liberal whose victory in Budapest's mayoral election in October upset the long dominance of Hungarian politics by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist Fidesz party. 
""Cities can do miracles in the areas of climate change and innovation. This makes the old adage of 'Think globally, act locally' especially acute,"" he added.
Some EU member states say the disbursement of EU funds for infrastructure and other projects should hinge on respect for democratic standards and the rule of law, which Orban's government and the ruling conservative nationalists in Poland are both accused of undermining. They deny the accusation.
The mayors said their cities - all in the hands of parties not in national government - should not be made to suffer for policies that were not their responsibility.
They said populist governments often used EU funds to entrench their positions and enrich friends, therefore urgently needed development aid should be channeled directly to cities where in any case the most pressing social and environmental problems are often concentrated. 
Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said the cities create a disproportionate share of their countries' economic output but also have an outsized carbon footprint.
""We have to allocate money to poorer regions so they catch up, but the cities are engines of growth. Governments that take money away from cities for political reasons hurt the entire region,"" he said.
Zdenek Hrib, mayor of Prague, Europe's seventh-richest region, said the economic gauge under which richer regions get less EU aid should be reviewed with factors such as social development also taken into account.

The mayors convened in Budapest at the Central European University, an embattled institution whose teaching has mostly been moved to Vienna following attacks by Orban.

""At least 304 people were killed and thousands were injured between 15 and 18 November as Iranian authorities crushed protests using lethal force,"" it said.
Amnesty said earlier this month that at least 208 were killed in the protests. Iranian authorities have dismissed Amnesty's previous figures and have yet to give a death toll from the deadliest protests In Iran in decades.
Hundreds of young and working-class Iranians took to the streets on Nov. 15 to protest against fuel price rises. The protests immediately turned political, with demonstrators burning pictures of senior officials and calling on clerical rulers to step down.
Iranian authorities earlier this month acknowledged that some ""rioters"" were shot and killed by security forces. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denounced the unrest as a ""very dangerous conspiracy"" by Iran's enemies.
Amnesty said Iranian authorities had carried out a ""wide-scale clamp down designed to instil fear and prevent anyone from speaking out about what happened"".
""Iran's authorities are...arresting thousands of protesters as well as journalists, human rights defenders and students to stop them from speaking out about Iran's ruthless repression,"" it said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission urged Malta on Monday to speed up reforms to ensure the independence of its judiciary amid uproar over the investigation into the 2017 murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
In a letter to Maltese Justice Minister Owen Bonnici seen by Reuters, European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said Malta should carry out a thorough investigation, free from political interference, to bring those responsible to justice.
A drawn-out inquiry has led Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to offer his resignation after his former chief of staff was briefly arrested by police investigating the murder.
Malta, said Reynders, needed to ensure the independence of judicial appointments and dismissals and a separate prosecution service, as requested by the EU in July.
""Recent controversies have underlined that progress should accelerate, for example on securing an effective and autonomous prosecution service with clear protections from the risk of political interference,"" Reynders wrote.
Muscat has said he will resign in mid-January once a new leader of his Labour Party is picked, but the European Parliament told EU leaders last Thursday he should go immediately to ensure the investigation is not compromised.
Caruana Galizia's family say they suspect Muscat's government of a cover-up. Muscat denies wrongdoing.
""The continued concerns surrounding the investigation have put the spotlight on a number of more systemic issues,"" Reynders wrote, adding that all EU countries should respect the rule of law.
Reynders advised Malta to set out a clear reforms timetable and to consult the Venice Commission, an advisory body of legal experts for the Council of Europe, on all draft legislation.
Two years after the car bomb that killed the anti-corruption journalist, police have been unable to say who hired the killers. Last month, a man given immunity from prosecution confessed to being the middleman.
Since then, one of Malta's wealthiest men has been charged with complicity to murder. Muscat's government has denied his request for immunity in return for testimony he said would implicate senior officials."

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The nomination of Lebanon's next prime minister was postponed on Monday as new complications surfaced in efforts to agree a government that is urgently needed to pull the country out of a destabilizing economic crisis.
More than seven weeks since Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister, prompted by protests against the ruling elite, politicians have been unable to agree on a new administration despite a deepening financial crunch.
The impasse took a violent turn at the weekend when Beirut was clouded in tear gas as security forces clashed with protesters who blame the politicians for corruption and bad governance. Dozens were wounded.
The economic crisis, years in the making, has come to a head since protests began in October: banks are restricting access to savings, the Lebanese pound has lost a third of its official value, and thousands of jobs have been lost. Some banks further lowered ceilings on cash withdrawals on Monday.
Despite differences between the main parties over the composition of a new government, Hariri had been on course to be nominated prime minister for a fourth time in the consultations.
But in a last-minute change of plan, President Michel Aoun postponed these until Thursday at Hariri's request to allow for more talks about the next government, the presidency said.
Political sources and analysts attributed the move to a decision by the Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) party to name neither Hariri nor anyone else for prime minister, a post which must go to a Sunni Muslim in Lebanon's sectarian system.
The LF wants a cabinet of independent specialists. 
Hariri, who is aligned with Gulf Arab and Western states, wants to lead a cabinet of specialists. But his position is at odds with Aoun and his powerful Shi'ite ally, the Iran-backed Hezbollah. Both believe the government must include politicians.
Hariri's office confirmed in a statement the decision was prompted by the LF move, saying it would have left him without the support of a leading Christian grouping, a necessity for ""national consensus"".
With tensions running high between Hariri and Aoun, who is also Christian, the LF decision denied Hariri's candidacy a pan-sectarian seal of approval.
SUNNI BACKING
""He can't come to office without (either) of the big Christian blocs,"" said Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of the An-Nahar newspaper. ""I don't expect from now until Thursday morning we will find a miraculous solution.""
A senior politician involved in contacts among the parties said the matters had grown more complicated.
The party founded by Aoun, the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), has said it will not join a government formed on Hariri's terms. The FPM urged an end to ""time wasting"" and urged Hariri to nominate a candidate of ""integrity"" to be prime minister.
But several attempts to find an alternative to Hariri have failed. Hariri is Lebanon's leading Sunni and the only candidate backed by the Sunni religious establishment.
The heavily armed Hezbollah has said the next government must bring all sides together to tackle the crisis, including the FPM. Hezbollah's leader has said the formation of a new government will be hard even if a prime minister is designated.
Lebanon's foreign allies have urged the formation of a credible government that can enact swift reforms if it wants to receive international support. 
Jan Kubis, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, said the weekend violence ""showed that postponements of a political solution of the current crisis create a fertile ground for provocations and political manipulation"". 

He added the violence should be investigated to prevent a move toward ""aggressive and confrontational behavior by all"".

PARIS (Reuters) - France's minister for pension reform resigned on Monday over a potential conflict of interest, dealing a blow to President Emmanuel Macron as trade unions staged a 12th day of strikes and prepared for more street protests against the planned changes.
Jean-Paul Delevoye, the High Commissioner for Pensions, was one of Macron's most trusted allies and one of few with cabinet experience. He quit after failing to publicly declare more than a dozen posts he held in addition to his cabinet job.
His resignation, first reported by Le Monde newspaper, comes at a crucial moment for Macron whose government is locked in a standoff with unions over the plans to overhaul France's convoluted pension system to help plug a chronic deficit.
The unions have said they will step up their protests unless the government withdraws the reform. Much of the rail network remained gridlocked on Monday as days of traffic chaos continued across France.
In a statement confirming Delevoye's resignation, Macron's office said: ""The president hails his personal commitment and his work on the pension reform. His withdrawal allows for a clarification of the situation.""
Delevoye had been drafted into the cabinet in September after submitting a report recommending that the retirement age for receiving a full pension be raised by two years.
Unions have branded any attempt to raise the retirement age a ""red line"" and have asked their members, including doctors, teachers, dockers and others to join mass protests on Tuesday after the government's broad plan was published on Dec. 11.
Pressure had been mounting on Delevoye to resign over the weekend after it emerged that he had failed to disclose publicly 13 positions, something a minister must do as part of a mandatory declaration of interest when taking up a cabinet role.
One of the positions was as a voluntary administrator for an insurance training institute, a sector that could benefit from the planned pension reform.
Delevoye has said it was a mistake not to disclose the posts, but with almost daily revelations appearing in local media, his position appeared increasingly compromised and could have distracted from the government's efforts to bring the unions back to the negotiating table.
""This project is essential for France. My staying on would weaken it,"" Delevoye said in his resignation letter, which was seen by Reuters."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine authorities said on Monday they had identified the suspects in the killing of a British tourist who was shot and killed in an armed robbery attempt outside a luxury Buenos Aires hotel over the weekend.
Police, meanwhile, arrested four member of the wider gang suspected of coordinating the crime.
Officials said they have identified and are working to arrest the gang members suspected in the shooting on Saturday, which killed one man and injured another in the luxurious tourist district known as Puerto Madero.
The gang suspected in the attack is known for other targeted robberies in Buenos Aires, police said.
""It's not the first thing they have done here in the city of Buenos Aires. We already managed to identity the actors and we are working on their arrest,"" said Gabriel Berard of the Buenos Aires police in a news conference on Monday.
The tourist, who a source with knowledge of the case confirmed as 50-year-old Matthew Gibbard of England, was targeted by the thieves for his high-end watch as he arrived at the capital's Ezeiza international airport on Saturday morning. He was traveling with his stepson, Stefan Zone, 28.
Men on motor bikes followed their car until it stopped outside the luxury Faena Hotel and attempted to rob them, police said.
When they resisted, Gibbard and Zone were shot. Gibbard died from his injuries. Zone is recovering in the hospital, the source said.
Officials said the vehicles used in the attack were stolen and had been identified by police.
Although fatal robbery attempts against tourists are rare in Buenos Aires, petty crime is common. In the last 12 months, a Swedish tourist was shot in the leg, which doctors had to amputate, in a robbery in the popular tourist neighborhood of San Telmo. Weeks later, a Canadian man was stabbed in a robbery attempt for his cell phone in the same area of the city."

Larkin, who is on his second season with Anadolu Efes, himself had also expressed interest in playing for the Turkish national team, echoing Turkish national team coach Ufuk Sarica.
""It would be a great offer, if it comes. I feel this is more like a home for me. Turkey's jersey would look pretty good on me too,"" Larkin said in an interview on Turkish television in September.
The 27-year-old had an unstable career at the NBA, playing one season each for the Dallas Mavericks (2013-14), New York Knicks (2014-15), Brooklyn Nets (2015-16). Later, he joined the Spanish side Baskonia (2016-17), and went back to Boston Celtics (2017-18), before joining Turkey's Anadolu Efes last year.
Sarica had complained about possible difficulties of the player getting a Turkish passport, but Erdogan's support means that the paperwork can be a formality.
""We will do what we need to do about it. We would like to see such a successful basketball player in our national team. Larkin can take our national team to very good results"", Erdogan said during a TV interview on Sunday.
Last month, Larkin broke the EuroLeague record by scoring the most points in a single game by netting 49 points against Bayern Munich in Istanbul.
Anadolu Efes is paying $2.6 million net to Larkin, who will get $2.8 million net for the 2020-21 season if he stays in Istanbul."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Protests over a new Indian citizenship law based on religion spread to student campuses on Monday as critics said the Hindu nationalist government was pushing a partisan agenda in conflict with the country's founding as a secular republic.
Students pelted stones at police who locked up the gates of a college in the northern city of Lucknow to prevent them from taking to the streets. About two dozen students at another college in the city sneaked out to protest. 
Anger with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was fueled by allegations of police brutality at Jamia Millia Islamia university on Sunday, when officers entered the campus in the capital New Delhi and fired tear gas to break up a protest. At least 100 people were wounded.
There were similar scenes at the Aligarh Muslim University in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where police also clashed with protesters.
Under the law passed by parliament last week, religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians in neighboring Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who have settled in India prior to 2015 will have a path to citizenship on grounds they faced persecution in those countries. 
Critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, weakens India's secular foundations.
The head of Jamia Millia demanded an investigation into how police were allowed to enter the campus. ""It is not expected of the police to enter the university and beat up students,"" Najma Akhtar told a news conference.
Students said police fired tear gas and windows were broken in the library. They ducked under desks and switched off the lights as advised by teachers. 
Hundreds of people gathered outside the New Delhi police headquarters to protest against alleged police brutality and the detention of students. Police said they acted with restraint.
Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, said the Modi government was dividing up Indian society through the citizenship law and a plan to launch a national citizenship register. 
""The best defense against these dirty weapons is peaceful, non-violent Satyagraha,"" he said in a tweet referring to the strategy of passive political resistance advocated by independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. 
The most violent protests during the past few days took place in the northeastern state of Assam, where mobs torched buildings and train stations, angry the law would help thousands of immigrants from Bangladesh become lawful citizens. At least two people were killed. 
Protests were held in Mumbai's Indian Institute of Technology and Tata Institute of Social Sciences overnight and on Monday and more were planned at Bombay University and in the southern city of Bengaluru later in the day. 
Some Bollywood celebrities like actress Konkona Sen Sharma, and directors Mahesh Bhatt and Anubhav Sinha, also criticized the police action on Twitter and called on others to speak up.
""We are with the students! Shame on you @DelhiPolice,"" Sen Sharma tweeted. 
Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party denies any religious bias. It says the new law is meant to help minority groups facing persecution in the three nearby Muslim countries.

Modi has said the law has been passed by parliament and there is no going back on it. He told a rally on Sunday the decision was ""1000 percent correct"".

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping offered his support for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Monday, praising her courage in governing the Chinese-ruled financial hub in these ""most difficult"" times after months of often violent anti-government protests.
His comments came after Hong Kong police fired tear gas in late night street clashes with anti-government protesters as the former British colony's worst political crisis in decades shows no sign of resolution.
""The situation in Hong Kong in 2019 was the most complex and difficult since its return to the motherland,"" Xi told local media in brief comments before a closed-door meeting with Lam in Beijing.
""The central government fully recognizes the courage and assumption of responsibility you have displayed in these exceptional times in Hong Kong.""
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, including a free press and independent judiciary, which the protesters say is being eroded by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. China denies the charge.
Hong Kong media have speculated that Lam's talks with Xi could yield fresh directives on the crisis, including a possible cabinet reshuffle. Xi did not go into specifics, but reiterated his support for Lam despite some previous media reports suggesting she might be replaced.
He added Beijing was ""unwavering in supporting Hong Kong police in firmly upholding the law"" and said Lam had continued to uphold the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
Xi said last month that China was ""unwavering"" in defending national security and sovereignty, implementing the ""one country, two systems"" policy and opposing foreign forces interfering in Hong Kong.
He stated on Monday that these were Beijing's basic positions on Hong Kong affairs.
Lam earlier met Premier Li Keqiang who said Hong Kong was not yet out of the ""dilemma"" facing the city's ailing economy after months of sometimes violent protests.
'RATHER SPECIAL' YEAR
Late on Sunday, groups of masked youths blocked roads around the densely populated Mong Kok district of Kowloon, over the harbor from Hong Kong island, prompting police to fire multiple rounds of tear gas and baton charge crowds.
Lam said she was encouraged by Xi's recognition of her efforts.
""This year is of course a rather special one because in the last six months Hong Kong has been haunted by social unrest, disturbances and violence acts,"" she said. ""So I spent a bit more time to give them an account of where things stand.""
Amid signs of the city's growing economic woes, Lam said China had pledged to continue to offer favorable economic policies and its full support, including development in the Greater Bay Area in Guangdong province adjoining the city.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said in a report on Monday that press freedom in Hong Kong has come under an accelerating squeeze despite China's pledges to maintain an open society. 
Large media companies had come under mainland Chinese ownership or influence, while targeted violence had underscored potential dangers for journalists who challenge China's wishes, the report said. 
Asked about the report during a daily news briefing in Beijing on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had not seen the report and that it was not worthy of comment.
Hong Kong, home to more than 7 million people, entered its first recession in a decade in the third quarter with the tourism and retail sectors particularly hard hit by the protests.
Hong Kong airport reported its biggest fall in passenger numbers in more than a decade in November, official data released on Sunday showed.
Lam's administration has pledged HK$25 billion ($3.2 billion) in stimulus but analysts say it is unlikely to have a major impact as long as the unrest continues.

While the number of protests and violence have eased in recent weeks, the pro-democracy movement still enjoys broad backing, with families, children and retirees coming out to recent demonstrations.

Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who was a legislator in India's most populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh, was convicted by the court in Delhi under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, lawyer Tanveer Ahmed Mir said. Sengar had pleaded not guilty. 
Sentencing is expected later in the week. 
The case was thrust into the spotlight last year when the accuser, who was a teenager in 2017 when she says she was raped, tried to kill herself, accusing the police of inaction.
In July, a truck crashed into the car of the woman who had accused Sengar of rape. Two of her relatives were killed in the crash and she was injured. Since then the family has been provided with security.
Having faced criticism for failing to act swiftly against the politician, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP expelled him from the party in August.

Public anger has been mounting in India over sexual violence against women and the lack of speedy justice for the majority of victims.

Arsenal distanced itself from Ozil's comments, saying that they were entirely his personal opinion. China’s state broadcaster CCTV later removed Arsenal’s Premier League game against Manchester City from its Sunday broadcast schedule.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions in Xinjiang as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a briefing: ""I don’t know if Mr. Ozil has ever been to Xinjiang personally but he’s been completely deceived by fake news and false statements have influenced his judgment.""
""We also welcome Mr. Ozil to come to Xinjiang if he has the chance, to take a walk and look around, as long as he has a conscience, is able to distinguish right from wrong and uphold the principles of objectivity and fairness, he will see a different Xinjiang,"" he added."

The country's anti-graft court decided in favor of the Marcoses for the fourth time since August, with judges ruling that photocopied documents could not be used as evidence, so the case would not proceed.
It has been referred to widely as the ""mother"" of cases in a three-decade effort by a special presidential panel to recover an estimated $10 billion allegedly siphoned off by Marcos and a family that had lived lavishly during his 20 years in power, 14 of which were ruled under martial law.
The case lodged by the Presidential Commission on Good Government had sought the return of 200 billion pesos ($3.93 billion) it said was tied up in equities, numerous local and foreign banks and real estate at home and in the United States and United Kingdom.
It also included the value of 177 paintings and 42 crates of jewelry worth nearly $9 million.
In a 58-page verdict, the court ""acknowledged the atrocities committed during martial law under the Marcos regime and the 'plunder' committed on the country's resources"".
""However, absent sufficient evidence that may lead to the conclusion that the subject properties were indeed ill-gotten wealth, the court cannot simply order the return of the same to the national treasury.""
The same court dismissed similar cases against the family in August, September and October, all for lack of evidence.
Despite being overthrown in a 1986 revolt and driven into exile, the Marcos family remain a powerful force in the Philippines, with loyalists throughout the bureaucracy and political and business elite.
The late leader's wife Imelda was a four-term congresswoman, daughter Imee is currently a senator, as was son and namesake Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who has been tipped as a possible candidate for the presidency in 2022. A relative is the current Philippine ambassador to the United States.

The family has a powerful ally too in President Rodrigo Duterte, who has spoken well of the former dictator, backed Imee's senate run and expressed a desire for Marcos Jr to have been his vice president.

The breakaway Turkish Cypriot cabinet on Friday designated the Gecitkale airport on the island as a base for the drones, Demiroren news agency said. It said unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), both armed and unarmed, would begin operations Monday.
Cyprus, an EU member, was divided in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. It has argued with Turkey for years over the ownership of fossil fuels in the eastern Mediterranean, thought to be rich in natural gas.
On Monday, the head of Turkey's Defence Industry Directorate Ismail Demir said the first unarmed Turkish drone took off from an airport in Turkey's western province of Mugla and landed at Gecitkale airport at 0700 GMT.
Turkey began seeking oil and gas off the coast of Cyprus earlier this year, sending two drill ships and an exploration vessel with UAVs escorting them. In response the European Union has called the activities illegal and readied sanctions against Turkey.
Ankara says that some areas in which Greek Cypriot ships operate are either on its continental shelf or in areas where the Turkish Cypriot state has rights over any finds.
Last month, Turkey and Libya's internationally recognized government signed an agreement on maritime boundaries in the sea. Athens has accused Turkey of violating international law with the deal, but Ankara denies the claims and says the accord aims to defend its rights in the region."

The row between U.S.-allied Arab states saw Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar in June 2017 over allegations that it backs terrorism. Doha denies the charge and says the embargo aims to undermine its sovereignty.
""We have broken the stalemate of non-communication to starting a communication with the Saudis,"" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told CNN on Sunday.
""We want to understand the grievances. We want to study them and to assess them and to look at the solutions that can safeguard us in the future from any other potential crisis,"" he said without mentioning what concessions, if any, were possible.
The boycotting nations set 13 demands, including closing Al Jazeera television, shuttering a Turkish military base, downgrading ties with Iran and cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Sheikh Mohammed, who made an unannounced visit to Riyadh in October amid hints the rift could soon subside, denied Qatar has direct ties with the Brotherhood, which the other countries label a terrorist organization.
He also said Doha would not alter its relationship with Ankara in order to resolve the dispute, which has undermined Washington's efforts to maintain Gulf unity to confront Iran.
""Any country that opened up for us and helped us during our crisis, we will remain grateful for them ... and we will never turn our back to them,"" he said.
Turkey sent troops, military hardware, food and water to small but wealthy Qatar after the boycott began.
Asked how long a resolution would take, Sheikh Mohammed said: ""We believe we are still at a very early stage, and what happened in the last 2-1/2 years was a lot and there is, I think, a need for some time to rebuild trust again.""
Qatar's premier attended an annual Gulf Arab summit in Riyadh last week, its highest representation since 2017, but the boycott got no direct public mention.
Efforts to end the row appeared to intensify after a September attack on Saudi oil plants that initially halved the kingdom's output and pushed the region toward war. Riyadh and Washington blame the strikes on Iran, which denies involvement."

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that official inquiries into last week's fatal volcano eruption could take up to a year, and will carry potential criminal penalties of up to five years in jail.
Ardern also announced a NZ$5 million ($3.2 million) fund to help small businesses affected by the eruption, after New Zealanders held a minute of silence to honor the victims a week on from the tragedy.
The official death toll from the surprise eruption on White Island, also known by its Maori name of Whakaari, stands at 16. Two people whose bodies are believed to be in the waters around the island are still officially listed as missing. 
A further 26 people remain in hospitals in New Zealand and Australia, many in critical condition with severe burn injuries. 
""There remains now questions to be asked and questions to be answered,"" Ardern told reporters in Wellington after she led the country in a minute of silence for the dead and injured, who included tourists from United States, Germany, China, Britain and Malaysia.
There has been growing criticism that people were allowed on the island, a popular destination for day-trippers, given the risks of an active volcano. That has led to speculation the tragedy could foretell major changes for New Zealand's thrillseeker tourism economy.
WorkSafe, New Zealand's primary regulator for workplace related incidents, has opened a health and safety investigation, Ardern said, while the coroner is conducting a separate inquiry.
Worksafe can prosecute individuals and companies for breaches of health and safety laws, with penalties including fines of up to NZ$3 million and jail terms of up to five years, Ardern said.
A coronial investigation is automatically triggered in the event of a sudden, violent or unnatural death. A coroner can also make recommendations to prevent similar deaths in the future.
Ardern said the Worksafe investigation could take a year, while the coronial inquiry was ""also likely to continue for some time.""
The NZ$5 million support fund is expected to be distributed among businesses in Whakatane, the mainland coastal town that serves as the jumping off point for trips to Whakaari. Asked if operators of tours to the island would be among the beneficiaries, Ardern said that specifics had not yet been determined. 
SEARCH ONGOING
At White Island, recovery teams again conducted aerial searches in a bid to locate the bodies of the last two people known to have been on the island. 
Six bodies were retrieved from the island on Friday, and officials believe the remaining two bodies are now likely to be in the surrounding waters. Naval divers are scheduled to continue the search on Tuesday.
""We will continue the operation for as long as we have a chance of recovering those bodies,"" New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush told Radio New Zealand.
Many of dead and injured were Australians on a day tour from a  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL) ship. The 16-deck Ovation of the Seas docked back in Sydney on Monday, with some passengers disembarking in tears as they were reunited with family members.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne met with her New Zealand counterpart in Wellington on Monday to express Australia's thanks to emergency and medical crews.
Legal experts said last week they expected to see lawsuits filed in the U.S. courts by injured passengers and families of those who died. Royal Caribbean's potential liability for the deadly excursion could hinge on whether the eruption was an unforeseeable ""act of God,"" maritime lawyers told Reuters.

""We will to continue to provide ongoing support and services to them and their families during this difficult time,"" a spokeswoman for the company said in an emailed statement on Monday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A backburning operation intended to contain a massive wildfire in eastern Australia sparked out of control, damaging buildings and cutting off major roads, authorities said, as the country heads into another heatwave that may topple temperature records.
The accident occurred about 250 km (155 miles) northwest of Sydney, where firefighters were trying to stop a blaze of some 378,000 hectares (934,000 acres) reaching communities by employing pre-emptive controlled burning.
""We saw a dramatic shift in conditions, a flare-up of fire, some extraordinary behavior of that fire, and that fire has spread,"" New South Wales state Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday.
Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the area, Fitzsimmons added, although he did not give an exact figure. There were no new reports of casualties on Monday.
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned nearly 3 million acres of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Bushfires are common in Australia's hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
Spot fires that would normally be contained on their own have been fanned by wind, coming together into what authorities have called megafires to Sydney's north, west and south, prompting evacuations and sporadically shrouding the country's biggest city in smoke.
The Bureau of Meteorology warned of severe to extreme heatwave conditions in the inland parts of the country's south-east, with temperatures expected to approach or exceed a national average record of 40.3 degrees Celsius (105.4 degrees Fahrenheit).
""We saw significant heat build over Western Australia over the course of last week, and that heat is now pushing east over the continent, which is going to lead to several days of exceptional heat,"" bureau climatologist Blair Trewin said in a statement.
""We're closely monitoring the development and progression of this heat but based on current forecasts we could see that record broken this week.""
The Rural Fire Service's Fitzsimmons said the heat would exacerbate fire danger, and ""despite the very best efforts of everyone, we're not going to able to contain these fires that we're expecting later in the week."""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore opposition politician was asked to correct a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post criticizing state education spending on Monday, the fourth use of a new ""fake news"" law that has been used against government opponents.
Government ministers are the arbiters of the Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which came into effect in October amid concern that it would be used to silence opposition ahead of an election expected within months.
In an effort to alleviate those concerns, Minister of Law K Shanmugam said when the legislation was passed in May that the law was meant to tackle ""falsehoods"", ""bots"", ""trolls"" and ""fake accounts"", and that free speech would not be affected.
Since the law was invoked on Nov. 26, three figures linked to the opposition and an opposition party have been told their online posts must carry a banner stating that they contain false information.
The posts ranged from accusing the government of influencing decisions by the state investment fund to an assertion that white-collar unemployment was rising.
The Ministry of Education on Monday directed opposition politician Lim Tean to correct a Facebook post about foreign students receiving more government funding than domestic students.
Lim responded on Facebook to defend his initial post saying it referred to grants and scholarships, and not overall spending, and he was considering legal options.
""It is clear to me that POFMA is being used by this government ahead of the upcoming GE (general election) to silence its opponents and chill public discussion of unpopular government policies,"" he said.
The POFMA office did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The Asia Internet Coalition, an association of internet and technology companies, has called the law the ""most far-reaching legislation of its kind to date"".
Facebook has said it was concerned the law grants broad powers to the government.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a press freedom non-profit group, called the law ""totalitarian"" and said it was aimed at eliminating public debate.
The government says the city-state is vulnerable to misleading and inaccurate news because of social sensitivities arising from its mixed ethnic and religious population, and widespread internet access.
Singapore has been ruled by the People's Action Party (PAP) since independence in 1965. The party is widely expected to win comfortably the next election, which must be held by early 2021."

One of the two Chinese officials is believed to be an intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover, the report said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, urged Pyongyang on Monday to return offers of talks, dismissing leader Kim Jong Un's year-end deadline while highlighting Washington's willingness to discuss ""all issues of interest"". 
Tension has been rising in recent weeks as Pyongyang has conducted a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with U.S. President Donald Trump, stoking fears the two countries could return to a collision course they had been on before launching diplomacy last year.
Biegun arrived in Seoul on Sunday amid speculation he might try to salvage negotiations by reaching out to North Korea, which has vowed to take an unspecified ""new path"" if Washington fails to soften its stance before the end of the year.
""The United States does not have a deadline. We have a goal,"" Biegun told a joint news conference with his South Korean counterpart Lee Do-hoon. 
""Let me speak directly to our counterparts in North Korea. It is time for us to do our jobs. Let's get this done. We are here, and you know how to reach us,"" Biegun said. 
'HOSTILE, UNNECESSARY'
Kim and Trump met three times since last year to negotiate an end to North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes but there has been scant progress. Working-level talks led by Biegun in October in Stockholm fell apart.
On Sunday, state media said North Korea had successfully conducted another test at a satellite launch site aimed at ""restraining and overpowering the U.S. nuclear threat,"" a second such test in a week.
Seoul officials are concerned the flare-up may signal a repeat of earlier cycles of detente ending in escalations. 
Biegun, who also met South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Monday, expressed regret over statements from North Korean officials in recent weeks, describing them as ""so hostile and negative and so unnecessary"". 
""But it does not have to be this way. It is not yet too late,"" Biegun said. 
Analysts said chances are slim for North Korea to accept Biegun's call for dialogue, citing Pyongyang's recent statements Washington had ""nothing to offer"" even if were talks to reopen.
""For North Koreans, Biegun effectively challenged their supreme leader by brushing off the year-end deadline,"" said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. 
Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean nuclear envoy, said Biegun's offer appeared to be aimed at undercutting Pyongyang's bid to deal directly with Trump.
Trump's re-election battle and the impeachment inquiry against him may have led Kim to overestimate North Korea's leverage, diplomatic sources have told Reuters.

""North Korea won't likely show up at the negotiating table unless the United States promises to make clear concessions instead of calling for a meeting for meeting's sake,"" said Kim Dong-yub, a professor at Kyungnam University in Seoul.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - It wasn't only the moves to ban Thailand's most vocal opposition party that brought Gift onto the street for the first time.
The 25-year-old landscape architect was also stung by taunts that her generation was not brave enough to go beyond online comments in challenging the army-dominated establishment's enduring hold since elections to end junta rule.
She and other first-timers joined veterans of Bangkok's turbulent decades of street protest as thousands rallied at the weekend in the biggest demonstration since a 2014 coup.
""They say the new generation only exists on social media, so we're out here to show we have a voice too,"" said Chattip Aphibanpoonpon, who like many Thais goes by her nickname.
""The conflict used to be about people on two sides. Now it's a battle between the military and the people. It's not fair.""
In a country long roiled by bloody protests - and punctuated by coups in the name of ending them - Saturday's peaceful rally was a reminder of the tension that is building again rapidly between the establishment and those seeking change.
At the forefront is 41-year-old auto-parts billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, who was recently banned as a member of parliament and whose Future Forward party faces dissolution.
In both cases, party supporters believe the legal grounds are spurious and designed to eliminate a challenge to Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha, the former junta leader who stayed on after March elections the opposition says were manipulated.
'JUST THE BEGINNING'
""This is just the beginning,"" Thanathorn told protesters who spilled in afternoon sunshine across walkways and staircases between a Bangkok shopping mall and art gallery.
The protest was called just a day before as a ""flash mob"" by Thanathorn's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live and a single tweet that got nearly 67,000 retweets and 41,000 likes.
It is Future Forward's social media heft - as well as pledges to change the army-drafted constitution and to end conscription - that have the army worried.
Army chief Apirat Kongsompong has said Thailand faces a situation of ""hybrid war"" against a movement he accuses of seeking to use social media to rally people against the army and the powerful palace.
""The young people are enthusiastic and determined and full of energy, but they don't see through politicians' tricks,"" said Warong Dechgitvigrom, a right-wing politician who sees Future Forward as an existential threat to Thailand and its monarchy.
Government spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat said the party should express its opinions through parliament rather than on the street, but she did not expect the situation to escalate.
The turnout was a reflection of growing political engagement among young people, but would not necessarily spiral, said Titipol Phakdeewanich, dean of the political science faculty at Ubon Ratchathani University.
""I don’t see it becoming a serious movement like in the past or on the scale of Hong Kong,"" he said.
Widespread coverage on social media underscored the extent to which the opposition leads the government on that front.
Thanathorn has 1.1 million Facebook followers and 670,000 on his @Thanathorn_FWP Twitter account, compared with Prayuth's 770,000 and 55,000 for @prayutofficial on Twitter.
That social media heft helped Future Forward into third place in the March election, after the traditional opposition party Pheu Thai and a pro-army party backing Prayuth.
The question has been whether online activism would translate into a readiness to take to the street. And it hasn't only been establishment parties casting doubt.
Before Saturday's rally, veteran activist Anurak Jeantawanich challenged Future Forward supporters as ""only using hashtags, but afraid to take to the streets"". If fewer than 2,000 people showed up ""you might as well just let your party be disbanded"", he said.
Several thousand gathered, if not the 10,000 plus claimed by organizers.
NOT ONLY TYPING
""I'm come from social media,"" read a placard held by Pisit Iewlatanawadee, a 29-year-old business owner from Nakhon Pathom in central Thailand.
""We're not only good at typing,"" he said. ""We also want to participate in opposition to authoritarian government.""
Rafah Supanphong, 25, told Reuters: ""They keep saying we are only brave on online platforms, it encouraged me to come out.""
The younger protesters joined many older ""red shirts"" who recalled years of street clashes and bullets in their support for ousted populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in clashes with pro-establishment ""yellow shirts"".
At the weekend protest, veteran Thaksin protesters sat munching sticky rice from wicker containers as young professionals took selfies nearby. 
Earlier, the Pheu Thai party of the self-exiled Thaksin said it backed the rally by ""younger brother"" Thanathorn.
A small group of police challenged the rally organizers for holding a demonstration without notice, but they made no attempt to stop it. On Monday, police said they were investigating whether the law had been broken.
Future Forward said it had not been a political rally so it did not need to give notice.
The next challenge for the authorities is a ""Run Against Dictatorship"" that activists are organizing for Jan. 12. A run Facebook page already has more than 28,000 likes.
Like many of those who joined Saturday's protest, Chattip is no radical tempered by hardship in a country where the traditional political fault-line has been between a Bangkok-based elite and the poorer north and northeast.
She works at a company that prides itself on harmonious garden and landscape designs. Her Instagram feed tracks good food, smiling friends and foreign adventures.
""The middle-class tend to not want to participate because we can afford to live normally no matter who the government is. But that's not the way it should be,"" she said. 

""We want democracy back ... Now is the time.""

TAKUA PA, Thailand (Reuters) - Fifteen years after the Indian Ocean tsunami killed more than 230,000 people on Boxing Day, 2004, a cargo container at a police station in southern Thailand bears witness to the hundreds of victims whose remains were never identified.
Inside are personal items - wallets, documents, electronics, all bagged and labeled as evidence - that police hope might one day help to give a name and a proper resting place to those buried nearby in graves marked only by numbers.
""There are still more relatives of the victims, both near and far, that have hopes of finding their lost loved ones,"" said Colonel Khemmarin Hassini, deputy police commander in Takua Pa district, one of the areas hardest hit by the tsunami.
Triggered by a massive 9.1-magnitude earthquake, the tsunami killed more than 230,000 people as waves as high as 17.4 meters (57 feet) crashed onto the shores of more than a dozen countries, wiping some communities off the map in seconds.
In Thailand, where more than 5,000 people died, the Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) unit involving police and forensic experts from 30 countries was able to identify more than 3,600 bodies in under two years, the largest and most successful project of its kind.
Colonel Khemmarin was part of that international team, but he said 15 years later a lot of the ""communication channels have shut down"" and leads had been lost.
""If we are determined enough and reactivate our operations once again, I think some of the 340 unidentified bodies could be identified,"" he told Reuters in Takua Pa town.
Hin Temna, 76, who lives in nearby Ban Nam Khem village, lost seven family members killed and his oldest daughter remains missing. They were among more than 1,500 people from the village who died in the disaster.
""There's no use to keep hoping (I will find my daughter). I don't think we will,"" he said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A small Singapore opposition party has corrected online posts critical of the government following an order by the labor ministry under a new 'fake news' law that rights groups say is being used to chill dissent.
Seeking to stir support ahead of a parliamentary election expected within months, the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), which has no seats in parliament, posted articles in recent months on its website and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) arguing that an increasing number of white-collar workers were losing their jobs.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) ordered the SDP to place a correction notice on these posts because it said jobs for professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) had been steadily rising since 2015.
""CORRECTION NOTICE: This post contains a false statement of fact"" was subsequently placed above the posts with a link to a government webpage where ""the correct facts"" could be found.
The SDP said it had complied but would appeal the order, the most severe since the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) came into effect in October.
The MOM said it would consider the grounds of SDP's application when submitted.
In the latest use of the law, the Ministry of Education on Monday directed opposition politician Lim Tean to correct a Facebook post about foreign students receiving more government funding than local students.
Reuters could not immediately reach Lim Tean.
The Asia Internet Coalition, an association of internet and technology companies, has called the law the ""most far-reaching legislation of its kind to date"".
Facebook has said it was concerned the law grants broad powers to the government.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a press freedom non-profit rights group, called the law ""totalitarian"" and said it was aimed at eliminating public debate.
The government says the city-state is vulnerable to misleading and inaccurate news because of social sensitivities arising from its mixed ethnic and religious population, and widespread internet access.
Singapore, which has been ruled by the People's Action Party (PAP) since independence in 1965, is widely expected to win comfortably the elections, which must be held by early 2021."

Disaster response officials said five people were believed to be trapped in the rubble of the Southern (NYSE:SO) Trade Shopping Centre in Padada, a town on the island of Mindanao located about 20 kms (12 miles) from the epicenter of Sunday's quake.
Rescuers were using chainsaws and thermal imaging equipment to look for survivors, but said there was little hope of finding anyone alive.
""It's very distressing. There's a very slim chance of finding survivors,"" regional disaster official Christopher Tan told CNN Philippines.
A six-year-old girl was killed when the wall of her house collapsed on her during the 6.8 magnitude quake, the fifth to hit the region since October. Rescuers also recovered the bodies of two women during a night disrupted by several aftershocks.
A further 31 people were injured, said Francis Irag, regional information officer.
(GRAPHIC: Philippines earthquake - https://graphics.reuters.com/PHILIPPINES-QUAKE/0100B4RJ2HR/Philippines-earthquake.jpg)
Television footage early on Monday showed fire and rescue personnel using torches to search the outside of the shopping center, a small two-storey building, in darkness. Roads were blocked by rubble and mangled metal.
There were widespread power outages and minor damage to more than 300 homes and eight government buildings, according to the disaster agency's report late on Sunday.
President Rodrigo Duterte and his family were in Davao City when the quake struck some 61 km (38 miles) away, but were not harmed.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - More than 100 activists protesting against a new Indian citizenship law were injured in New Delhi on Sunday as they clashed with police who used tear gas and baton charges to disperse demonstrators at a major university.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says the new law will save religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians from persecution in neighboring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan by offering them a path to Indian citizenship. But critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, weakens India's secular foundations.
Sunday was the fifth straight day of protests across the country against the law enacted earlier this month, and the third day running in the capital. 
Police tried to contain thousands of protesters, including locals and students, who had gathered near the Jamia Millia Islamia University in southeast Delhi. Clashes erupted and authorities said protesters torched buses, cars and motorbikes.
Officials at two local hospitals said more than 100 people with injuries had been brought in following the clashes. 
""Many of them have fracture injuries. We are running out of plaster of paris for casts,"" said Inamul Hassan, an official at the Alshifa Hospital located near the university, adding more than 80 people with injuries had been brought to the hospital.
A spokesman for Holy Family Hospital told Reuters' partner agency ANI that it had treated 26 students suffering from minor injuries. 
POLICE STORM CAMPUS
Police resorted to baton charges and firing tear gas on the protesters to disperse them, according to a Reuters witness. Officers stormed the campus grounds to confront protesters they said fled into the university and threw stones at police.
""About 4000 people were protesting and police did what they did to disperse them when the crowd burnt buses,"" said Chinmoy Biswal, a senior police officer in the area. ""If it had been a peaceful mob it would have been dispersed peacefully.""
He added that police entered the campus to maintain order and that six officers had been wounded in the clashes.
However some students and officials at Jamia Millia, a storied institution almost 100 years old, decried the police action.
""Police have entered the campus by force, no permission was given. Our staff and students are being beaten up and forced to leave the campus,"" Waseem Ahmed Khan, a senior faculty member of the university, told ANI. 
Student Tehreem Mirza said students took shelter in the library after police on the campus fired tear gas.
BJP-CONGRESS BLAME GAME
The protests have raged particularly in some eastern states such as Assam, Tripura and West Bengal, where resentment toward Bangladeshi immigrants has persisted for decades.
Authorities have shut down internet access in several parts of the affected states in an attempt to maintain law and order.
Modi, speaking at a rally in the eastern state of Jharkhand on Sunday, blamed the opposition Congress party and its allies for inciting violence against the citizenship law.
The Congress party in turn slammed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party on Twitter saying, the government ""has failed at its duty to maintain peace in the nation.""
Local authorities ordered all schools in southeast Delhi to remain closed on Monday. Jamia Millia university had already said, on Saturday, that it was closing early for the winter break. The Aligarh Muslim University in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh also announced that it was shutting early for the break after student protesters clashed with police on Sunday. 
Hundreds of activists gathered outside the New Delhi police headquarters on Sunday night to protest against alleged police brutality and the detention of students. 
A lawyer, who is trying to negotiate the release of detained students, said at least 28 were being held at one police station in South Delhi. A police spokesman did not respond to a call, or message asking about the number of people detained.

Meanwhile, protests against the law continued in parts of eastern India. A highway connecting West Bengal and Assam was blocked in several places on Sunday when protesters burnt tires, demanding the law be scrapped. Violence was also reported in Patna, the capital of the eastern state of Bihar.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Tear gas engulfed central Beirut as security forces chased protesters near Lebanon's parliament on Sunday in a second night of street clashes that wounded dozens of people. 
Protesters had returned despite a fierce crackdown by security forces the night before when clashes also injured dozens. 
It marked the most violent unrest in the capital in a historic wave of protests that has swept Lebanon since Oct. 17 and pushed Saad al-Hariri to resign as prime minister. 
The protests erupted from anger at a political elite that has overseen decades of corruption and steered the country toward its worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
""We will not leave. They are the ones who looted the country. They are the ones who got us here. We want our rights,"" said Nadine Farhat, 31, a lawyer protesting on Sunday. 
Riot police and security forces, deploying again in large numbers, unleashed water cannons at hundreds of demonstrators who remained on the streets.
The Lebanese Civil Defense said it had treated 46 people for injuries and taken 14 others to hospital. 
The clashes rocked a commercial district of Beirut for hours late into the night, and army soldiers closed off some roads. 
Lebanon's Internal Security Forces said they fired tear gas after demonstrators pelted them with fireworks and stones, injuring some officers. On Twitter, the ISF called on people to leave the streets. 
Crowds of men and women ran for cover chanting ""revolution, revolution!"" as white smoke streaming out of tear gas canisters encircled them. Some hurled the canisters back at riot police standing nearby in body armor.
""They attacked us in a barbaric way, as if we're not protesting for their sake, their children,"" said a protester, Omar Abyad, 25, a nurse who has been unemployed since he graduated two years ago. 
Abyad said he rallied on Sunday in part against Hariri's potential return as prime minister, calling him one of the same faces who have long ruled the country.
Lebanon's main parties have fueded over forming a new government, and Hariri is expected to be named prime minister again at formal consultations on Monday. But political rifts look set to hinder agreement on the next cabinet, which the country badly needs to ward off an even worse crisis.
Foreign donors say they will only help after there is a cabinet in place that can enact reforms.
Lebanon's economic woes, long in the making, have come to a head: Pressure has piled on the pegged Lebanese pound. A hard currency crunch has left many importers unable to bring in goods, forcing up prices. And banks have restricted dollar withdrawals.

""There's no work, no wages, no money, nothing,"" Abyad said. ""I am in the streets and I have nothing to lose.""

465,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2019 05:09PM ET</span>",Colombia peace court exhumes bodies in extrajudicial killings case,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's special justice tribunal has begun to exhume bodies from a grave in the country's northwest as part of an investigation into as many as 50 possible extrajudicial killings allegedly committed by the army.
The Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), a tribunal created under a 2016 peace deal to prosecute former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels and military leaders for alleged war crimes, has started exhumation work in a cemetery in the municipality of Dabeiba, it said in a statement late on Saturday.
""This process is taking place after a series of voluntary testimonies, in which an ex-member of the Army indicated they had knowledge of illegitimate deaths presented as people killed in combat by agents of the state in Dabeiba,"" the JEP said.
""It is presumed that in the Dabeiba cemetery the remains of 50 people presented as killed in combat or false positives will be found,"" the statement added. 
The term false positives refers to civilians murdered by members of the military and registered as guerrilla fighters killed in combat so that soldiers could receive benefits for conducting apparently successful anti-insurgency missions.
False positive killings numbered at least 2,248 between 1998 and 2014. The majority of the murders took place during the term of former President Alvaro Uribe, according to the attorney general's office. 
Dozens of army officials have been arrested and convicted of involvement in the killings, with some appearing before the JEP to testify and receive lighter sentences than they would under the ordinary justice system.
The Defense Ministry said in a statement late on Saturday that members of the military are cooperating with the JEP. 
Some human rights groups say the number of false positives could be as high as 4,000.
Preliminary information indicates most of the presumed victims in the Dabeiba grave will be men aged between 15 and 56 who resided in Medellin, the JEP added. Some were disabled.
Seven bodies have so far been recovered since the exhumations began on Dec. 9, the JEP said, without specifying the dates or causes of their deaths.
A figure of 50 bodies would make it one of the largest-ever massacres committed by the armed forces.
Colombia's five-decade internal conflict between guerrilla groups, right-wing paramilitaries, drug gangs and the army has killed more than 260,000 people and displaced millions. Figures of those forcibly disappeared vary widely, but number in the tens of thousands.

Hariri, a Western ally and the leading Sunni Muslim politician, is widely seen by politicians as the only candidate for the post. He quit the job in late October under pressure from protests against the political elite that has overseen decades of corruption and bad governance. 
But he is at odds with Iran-backed Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah movement and its allies, including President Michel Aoun, over the make-up of the next government.
Lebanon needs a new government to pull it out of the worst economic crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war. Foreign donors will only help after there is a cabinet that can enact reforms. 
Hariri wants to lead a cabinet of specialist ministers which he says would be able to tackle the crisis and attract foreign aid, while his opponents want a combination of politicians and experts.
Aoun's formal consultations with lawmakers to designate the premier, postponed from last week, are scheduled to take place on Monday despite the dispute.
""It should be clear to anyone who might nominate Hariri tomorrow that he will only form a government of specialists,"" a source close to Hariri told Reuters.
Aoun is required to choose the candidate with greatest support among parliament's 128 lawmakers.
Though it was not immediately clear how many lawmakers would back Hariri, political sources said he would most likely be picked, barring any last-minute surprise in Lebanon's volatile politics. 
Attempts to reach compromise deals on other candidates for the job of prime minister - reserved for a Sunni in Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system - have failed. 

Hundreds of people protesting against the ruling elite returned to central Beirut on Sunday, despite a fierce crackdown by security forces near parliament the previous night. The security forces had fired tear gas and rubber bullets overnight at demonstrators in clashes that wounded dozens.

Similar attacks have killed at least 179 civilians, researchers say, since the Congolese army launched an offensive on Oct. 30 against the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active in eastern Congo.
In his State of the Nation address on Friday, Congo President Felix Tshisekedi said the campaign had ""dismantled"" nearly all of the ADF's sanctuaries and that the rebels were turning to guerrilla tactics out of desperation.
But the government has blamed the ADF for similar attacks going back years, including dozens of night-time massacres since 2014 that have killed hundreds of civilians. Repeated military operations have failed to fully eradicate the group.
Richard Kivanzanga, the deputy administrator of Beni territory, told Reuters he had counted 22 bodies on Sunday in the villages of Baoba and Ntombi.
""The assailants killed women, men and children,"" he said. ""It wasn't possible to evacuate all the bodies today because we had to wait for an escort from the army.""
The surge in violence has lead to deadly protests against the army and U.N. peacekeepers for failing to protect them.
It has also complicated efforts to stamp out an Ebola outbreak in the area. Infections have started to rise in areas health workers have been unable to access because of insecurity.
The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Tuesday on six members of the ADF, including its leader Musa Baluku. Islamic State has claimed some ADF attacks this year, but researchers say there is a lack of hard evidence linking the two groups."

The newspaper reported https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/world/asia/us-china-spies.html on Sunday that one of the two Chinese officials is believed to be an intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover.
The Chinese officials breached security at a base in Virginia this fall, and only stopped driving after fire trucks were used to block their path, the Times said.
A law enforcement official familiar with the episode confirmed to Reuters that the account in the New York Times is accurate.
An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the incident.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Chinese Embassy in Washington could not be immediately reached for comment.
Though the exact reason for why the Chinese officials drove onto the base in Norfolk, Virginia was unknown, American officials believe it may have been to test security, one source told the newspaper.
When they finally stopped driving, the Chinese officials told the military guards they had gotten lost.
Weeks later, on Oct. 16, the State Department issued new rules on Chinese diplomats which require them to notify the department before they have any meetings with local or state officials, or with educational and research institutions.
The United States in recent years has stepped up efforts to combat concerns about suspected spying by the Chinese.
Investigators have been asking American universities to keep a closer watch on students and visiting Chinese scholars, and last year U.S. President Donald Trump signed a law prohibiting the U.S. government from buying telecom and surveillance equipment from Chinese companies Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063).

Firefighters recovered 10 bodies as the fire ripped through the three-storey factory at Gazipur, on the outskirts of Dhaka, local police official, Jabedul Islam, said.
It was not immediately clear how many workers were inside the factory when the fire broke out and what caused the blaze, he added.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of backing terrorism and aligning itself with Iran.
Doha denies their charges and accuses its neighbors of seeking to curtail its sovereignty.
Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser Al Thani attended an annual Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Saudi Arabia last Tuesday, its highest representation at the meeting since 2017.
Asked at the Doha Forum in Qatar if the recent contact between Doha and Riyadh was good for the region, Zarif told reporters: ""Of course it is.""
Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told the same event on Saturday that there had been ""small progress"" in resolving the bitter dispute.
Sheikh Mohammed briefly met with Zarif in public at the forum on Sunday and sat in the audience as the Iranian foreign minister gave an address.
Kuwait and the United States have tried to mediate the rift between Qatar and its neighbors, which has undermined Washington's efforts to confront Iran.

Mainly Shi'ite Iran and Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia are locked in a struggle for influence in the Gulf region.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Small groups of protesters gathered in shopping malls across Hong Kong on Sunday amid brief scuffles with riot police as attention turned to an upcoming meeting between Hong Kong's leader and China's president.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam is scheduled to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Monday and some observers say the visit could yield fresh directives including a possible cabinet reshuffle. 
Lam, however, appeared to play that down before she left, saying the first task was to curb violence and restore order.
On Sunday in the peak shopping season ahead of Christmas, groups of masked protesters, clad in black, marched through several malls chanting slogans including ""Fight for freedom"" and ""Return justice to us"".
Riot police used pepper spray on crowds in one Kowloon mall, local media reported. 
In Shatin, Reuters witnessed police firing a tear gas canister outside the New Town Plaza mall, and several people were taken away after entrances and walkways were blocked, glass panels smashed, and graffiti sprayed. 
Police said in a statement that some shops had been damaged and that a smoke bomb had been set off. Many shops closed early. 
In the evening, several hundred protesters held a vigil for a protester who fell to his death outside a luxury mall exactly six months ago after holding up a banner. Some laid white flowers, as others softly hummed 'Sing Hallelujah' to commemorate Leung Ling-kit, known as ""raincoat man"" for what he wore at the time.
""He is the first person to die because of this revolution,"" said Tina, 18. ""I came tonight because I want to always remember that we can’t give up and we have to keep fighting for freedom.""
Several hundred people, many social workers, gathered earlier to reiterate demands that include full democracy and an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality. Some called for more mass strikes, while others sat at tables to write Christmas cards to those who have been jailed. 
Separately, a pro-government rally drew over a thousand people, with participants denouncing the use of violence during protests. 
Hong Kong has been embroiled in its worst political crisis in decades since June with anti-government protests posing a populist challenge to China's Xi and complicating ties between China and the United States at a time of heightened tensions including over trade. 
Demonstrators have railed against what they see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, gradually ramping up the use of violence over many months of unrest. 
They also say they are responding to excessive use of force by police. Last Sunday, a protest march drew around 800,000 people, according to organizers, suggesting the movement still has significant public support.
The government is planning more public dialogue through social media channels, as well as a second town hall session with top officials to try to bridge differences. 

Despite the febrile public mood, China maintains it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula granting Hong Kong autonomy and says it fully supports Lam.

The statement by Argentina cabinet chief Santiago Cafiero contradicted Argentine Foreign Minister Felipe Sola, who had said on Thursday he had asked Morales to refrain from making political statements.
Argentine President Alberto Fernandez, inaugurated on Tuesday, had said before taking office that leftist Morales would be welcome in the country. Morales left Bolivia after a contested October election that caused a political crisis.
""The refugee has the same rights as an Argentine citizen in terms of freedom of expression. We are not going to restrict his freedoms,"" Cafiero told daily newspaper La Nacion.
Morales later wrote on Twitter that he was helping to plan his party's campaign strategy for the upcoming election.
Bolivia's acting president said on Saturday that an arrest warrant for Morales on charges of sedition would be issued over the days ahead.
Morales left Bolivia in mid-November, within days of resigning after the Organization of American States said there were irregularities in the way votes were counted in the October election. Morales claims to have won re-election in the vote.
He resigned under pressure from the armed forces in what he has called a coup d'etat. Morales Arrive in Argentina from Mexico, where he had spent about a month after leaving Bolivia."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey moved closer to military support for Libya's internationally recognized government late on Saturday when a bilateral deal that provides for a quick reaction force if requested by Tripoli was sent to parliament.
Ankara's latest move raises tensions in the Mediterranean region and risks confrontation with forces led by Khalifa Haftar based in eastern Libya, where rival political factions have been based since 2014.
Late last month, Ankara and Tripoli signed an expanded security and military accord and, separately, a memorandum on maritime boundaries that Greece said violates international law. 
While the maritime accord has been sent to the United Nations for approval, the military deal has been presented to Turkey's parliament. ""Parliament will enter it into force after approval,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Sunday.
It was unclear when a vote would take place in the parliament controlled by President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party (AKP) and its nationalist MHP allies.
On Thursday, Haftar urged his forces to advance toward the center of Tripoli in what he said would be a ""final battle,"" after an offensive against the government that began in April but has stalled outside the capital.
Athens, which expelled the Libyan ambassador over the maritime boundary pact, has condemned the maritime accord and warned that Ankara is escalating tensions in the region.
""Turkey must choose if it will follow the road of self-isolation, continuing to play the role of trouble-maker in the region, or behaving like a good neighbor henceforth,"" Greece's deputy foreign minister, Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, told Sunday's Ethnos newspaper.
Greece has also condemned new Turkish gas exploration off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus. 
On Sunday, Israel's energy ministry told Reuters that a Turkish vessel had asked one of its research ships to leave an area where it was ""legally located in Cyprus's commercial waters."" Israeli and Turkish media said Turkey's navy escorted the ship away in the incident, which occurred two weeks ago. 
According to the text of the military agreement sent to Turkish lawmakers, Tripoli could request vehicles, equipment and weapons for use in army, navy and air operations. It also provisions for new intelligence sharing. 
Utku Cakirozer, lawmaker from Turkey's main opposition CHP and a member of the NATO parliamentary assembly, said it was ""worrying"" that Erdogan raised the prospect of sending troops and taking sides in the Libyan conflict.

""Turkey should not enter into a new adventure,"" he told Reuters. ""The AKP government should immediately stop being a party to the war in Libya.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will ""get Brexit done"" by Jan. 31 and then agree a new trade deal with the European Union by the end of 2020, cabinet office minister Michael Gove said on Sunday, vowing to deliver on the government's top priority.
Johnson and his team were triumphant last week when he won a commanding majority of 80 at an early election he said he was forced to call to break the Brexit deadlock. Winning over many traditionally Labour voters in northern and central England, Johnson has proclaimed he will lead a ""people's government"".
First, the Conservative leader must make good on his often-repeated promise to ""get Brexit done"" and then turn to realizing another priority - to increase funding into Britain's much loved but struggling public health service, a pledge he plans to enshrine in law.
""I can absolutely confirm that we will have an opportunity to vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in relatively short order and then we will make sure that it passes before January 31st,"" Gove told Sky News.
Asked about a new trade accord with the EU, Gove said: ""It will be concluded next year. We will be in a position to leave the European Union before the 31st of January next year and then we will have concluded our conversations with the EU about the new framework of free trade and friendly cooperation that we will have with them by the end of next year."" 
The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has cast doubt over whether the trade talks will be so swiftly concluded, saying last month that the negotiations would be ""difficult and demanding"" and warning Britain the bloc ""will not tolerate unfair competitive advantage"".
Johnson, who celebrated his victory by visiting Sedgefield, a former Labour bastion that was the parliamentary seat of ex-prime minister Tony Blair but voted Conservative this time, will set out his program on Thursday in a Queen's Speech.
Rishi Sunak, a deputy finance minister, said the government aimed to re-submit the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to parliament for ratification before Christmas to allow ministers to start work on other priorities such as ""leveling up"" the country.
LABOUR SOUL-SEARCHING
After more than three years of debate over Brexit, Johnson faces a struggle to unite a country where disagreements over how, when or whether Britain should leave the EU have torn towns, villages and even families apart.
According to the Sunday Times, Johnson plans to make major changes to his top team of ministers in February to focus on delivering his election promises, especially those made to voters in northern and central England, once called the ""red wall"" because of their loyalty toward Labour.
For the opposition Labour Party, Thursday's election was its worst result since 1935 and underlined how its equivocal Brexit policy and its socialist leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had proven an electoral disaster for many traditional supporters.
""Let me make it clear that it's on me. Let's take it on the chin,"" Labour's finance chief John McDonnell told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""I own this disaster.""
He said there would be a new leader in place by early next year, and already some said they were considering running. 
Lisa Nandy, a lawmaker for the northern town of Wigan, said she could enter the race, while justice policy chief Richard Burgon said he would back Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour's business policy chief, if she decided to run for the leadership.
Corbyn, who apologized to Labour supporters in two newspapers on Sunday, has said he will step down as soon as a new leader has been elected by the party membership.
""I will make no bones about it. The result was a body blow for everyone who so desperately needs real change in our country...I'm sorry that we came up short and I take my responsibility for it,"" he wrote.

But Corbyn added: ""I remain proud of the campaign we fought ... And I'm proud that our message was one of hope, rather than fear.""

Kurz's People's Party (OVP) won 37.5% of the vote in the Sept. 29 election, meaning they require a coalition partner to command a majority in the lower house.
Since then talks with the resurgent Greens have taken longer than for the last coalition Kurz assembled, with the far-right Freedom Party in 2017. Both sides have said big differences remain and the Greens have said they are in no hurry.
""I want to be done by early January,"" Kurz told Sunday's edition of the Kronen Zeitung tabloid.
Another newspaper, Kurier, which is part of the same media group, quoted Kurz as saying: ""There will be a government in January.""
Kurier said the final coalition deal would be presented to the public between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11 at the latest, while Krone said that if all goes according to plan the new government will be sworn in by mid-January. Both cited Kurz as their source.
Little has emerged so far on the details of the talks, and Kurz has made disciplined communications one of his hallmarks, along with a tough line on immigration on which he has built his career.
Both newspapers, however, had an initial outline of the coalition deal taking shape. The talks will only break for three days over Christmas, Krone said.
One of the Greens' priorities is adjusting taxes to better reflect the environmental impact of certain goods, such as doing away with favorable treatment of diesel fuel.
Kurier said one initiative that appears to have been agreed is that ""environmentally damaging emissions"" will become more expensive but commuters who do not have the opportunity to use public transport instead of their car will receive some kind of compensation.
Kurz said during the campaign that any measures to reduce carbon emissions should not come at the expense of ordinary citizens who drive to work.
Kurier said the parties had agreed public transport would be made ""massively"" cheaper and ""a large amount of money"" would be spent on expanding the rail network - in a country where public transport is already relatively efficient and cheap.
At the same time, however, Kurz told both newspapers he is committed to running a balanced budget and maintaining his hard line on immigration."

Georgian villagers living near the loosely guarded rural boundary are often detained on similar grounds but the detention of the doctor, a high-profile local figure, has drawn more attention. Colleagues said he was trying to reach a patient.
Vazha Gaprindashvili, president of Georgia's association of orthopaedists and traumatologists, was taken to South Ossetia's regional center Tskhinvali on Nov. 9 and given two months of pretrial custody by separatist authorities, who said the doctor had crossed illegally into the territory.
Hundreds of people including Gaprindashvili's relatives, colleagues, politicians and civic activists gathered on Sunday at the administrative boundary line in the village of Odzisi demanding Gaprindashvili's release.
Some held posters saying ""Freedom for Doctor Vazha!"" and ""Love for the Motherland is not a crime.""
The Georgian Foreign Ministry said last month the doctor's Gaprindashvili's detention ""highlights the alarming situation of human rights violations in the occupied territories"".
The United States and rights group Amnesty International called for Gaprindashvili's immediate release and reopening of all cross points along the South Ossetia boundary. Russian authorities had no immediate comment.
Russia won a brief war against fellow ex-Soviet republic Georgia in 2008, after which Moscow recognized two Georgian breakaway regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as independent and deployed troops there. Russia and South Ossetia signed a deal in 2015 to integrate their security forces."

WHAKATANE (Reuters) - Helicopter pilot Mark Law did not hesitate to fly out to New Zealand's White Island volcano immediately after it erupted to carry survivors to hospital, but after a harrowing week he knows his town's adventure tourism industry faces an uncertain future.
As the search continues for the final two missing bodies from Monday's deadly eruption, Law knows it will be challenging for his business, Kahu Helicopters. Some of his seven staff, including three pilots, could lose their jobs.
""We're going to be greatly affected, we're anticipating probably damn near shutting the doors. It's going to be devastating, we've been operating that part of our business for years,"" he said.
Law is not alone worrying about his future in Whakatane, a picturesque town of 35,000 of the shore of the Bay of Plenty that is the main access point to the volcanic island.
Anne Tolley, the local member of parliament, said the town was shattered by the disaster and its thoughts were with the victims, but hoped that tours would one day restart.
“It is iconic and it is certainly is the centerpiece of the town’s tourism. We also have fantastic beaches and walks and the kiwi, but Whakaari, you will have seen all the signs, we are the gateway to Whakaari,"" Tolley told Reuters, using the Māori name for the volcano.
Daily tours had taken more than 10,000 visitors every year to privately owned island 50km (30 miles) off the coast.
Tours to the island were part of Whakatane's history, and operators had been gearing up for the peak Christmas holiday season before Monday's disaster, Tolley said.
“It’s very difficult coming at probably the busiest time of year for them. It will be devastating.""
 
RESCUE
On Monday, the 48-year-old Law had quickly organized three other pilots to fly out to the island, where they picked up 10 badly burned people and flew them back to Whakatane's hospital.
Law and his team tried to fly back to the island to recover the bodies of those they knew had died, but were ""tremendously disappointed"" to be stopped by police.
After initially being sidelined from police operations, by mid-week Law was sharing his knowledge of the volcano's terrain and environment with the military squad that on Friday retrieved six of the eight bodies left behind. On the weekend, the search continued for the remaining bodies.
""At the end of the day people on the ground generally know and it is important… to weave into the plan the effort of the local people,"" Law told Reuters.  
 
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Shock had ripped through Whakatane at the eruption, with the local hospital overwhelmed as dozens of seriously injured people were delivered from the island.
Whakatane's tourism sector had been growing strongly with the unique marine volcano at its heart, but with the prospect that people may be reluctant to visit the island even if it is reopened, immediate prospects will be challenging.
As the recovery mission on Friday played out, Boz Te Moana, 24, and Michael Mika, 28, waited to support their community gathered in the indigenous Māori marae, or meeting ground.
The two, who had traveled from their homes further up the Whakatane River, hoped in time tours to the waters around the island would be allowed again but tourists should not step foot on it again, out of respect for the dead, they said.

""I don’t know if the mamae or the hurt will ever change, but the environment, it's up to the town itself to move forward from here in the most positive way,"" said Te Moana, using the Māori word for pain.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hailed the completion of the National Stadium built for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics on Sunday, his speech at the Kengo Kuma-designed venue praising the efforts to finish on schedule after an early setback.
The stadium, built at a cost of 156.9 billion yen ($1.44 billion), will have a capacity of 68,000 when it hosts the Olympic Games opening ceremony on July 24.
It will stage athletics and soccer events at the Games as well as the closing ceremony.
During his speech, Abe referred to the challenges organizers faced when the original design was scrapped because of a public outcry over spiraling costs.
The change meant construction did not begin until December 2016 and the stadium was unable to host matches at this year's Rugby World Cup as originally planned.
“For this National Stadium, which will be the symbol of Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic games, I assume there must have been many difficulties for the process of its construction,” said Abe.
""The design was changed during the process. 
“It is purely the result of everyone’s ‘All Japan’ contribution and hard work, so that we finally celebrate today.”
Sunday’s ceremony was restricted to a small number of officials and the first public event will be on Dec. 21.
The Emperor’s Cup soccer final will be the first sporting contest to be staged there on New Year’s Day.
“We have to make next year’s Tokyo Games an opportunity to share dreams and hopes, to create a proud legacy, show Japan’s power to the world, and open up the future of this country,” said Abe.

The 2020 Olympics run from July 24 to Aug. 9.

MANILA, Philippines (Reuters) - A strong earthquake struck near the Philippine city of Davao on Sunday, killing a child, damaging buildings and causing several injuries, officials said, the latest in a series of tremors to strike the southern part of the country in recent months.
The magnitude 6.8 quake was centered 61 km (38 miles) southwest of Davao on the island of Mindanao, at a depth of 28.2 km, the U.S. Geological Survey said, revising down the magnitude from an earlier 6.9. 
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat from the quake, based on available data.
Vincent Fernandez, the mayor of Matanao town in Davao del Sur province, near the epicenter, told Radio DZMM that a six-year-old girl had died after a wall collapsed on her. 
Fernandez said the extent of the damage was not yet clear but authorities needed food, water and tarpaulins and blankets to help residents.
Anthony Allada, public information officer of nearby Magsaysay Town, said 14 people were injured but none seriously. Roads and buildings, including the local government office, were damaged and power was out in the town, he said.
The region was shaken by four powerful quakes in October and November, which together killed at least 20 people.
""We don’t know what to do anymore. Do we respond first or attend to our families first?”, Allada told Radio DZMM.
President Rodrigo Duterte, who is from Davao, was in the city when the quake struck.
“He is ok. He and his daughter Kitty were in their house when the quake struck,"" presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said. ""First Lady Honeylet was on her way home when the ground trembled. She said her car was swaying. She is unhurt.”
A three-story building collapsed in the town of Padada, in Davao del Sur, the local disaster agency reported. Authorities said some people were inside the building, which housed a grocery market, and a rescue effort was underway.
""I saw the building when it fell,"" Leighton Angcan, a resident of Padada told Reuters. It was the tallest here and it was really destroyed. I saw people running outside.""
Video footage posted by users on Twitter showed overhead electrical wires swaying and erupting in a shower of sparks. Another video showed water sloshing out of a hotel swimming pool.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said damage and aftershocks could be expected.
Several strong aftershocks were recorded after the main tremor, the strongest a magnitude 5.7 centered north of General Santos City. 

The Philippines sits on the geologically active Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" and experiences frequent tremors.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Dozens of Indonesians have taken part in a shouting competition in the capital Jakarta, given five minutes on stage to belt out advice on issues such as health, education and child protection to a crowd below.
The contestants, mainly housewives, come from the city's native Betawi inhabitants, who have a reputation in Indonesia for being spontaneous and outspoken.
As well as being restricted to certain topics, contestants were barred from using swear words or pointing their finger when addressing the crowd, said organizer Muhammad Rifki.
The competition aimed to capture typical Betawi traditions, with winners competing for 1.5 million rupiah ($107) in prize money, he said. 
""Those are actually words or proverbs which are being used in the daily life,"" said Rifki.The competition, which is part of a festival hosted by the Kampung Melayu district, is being held in the densely populated neighborhood in the city of 10 million for the first time.
Housewife Sulistywati, who uses one name and was one of the 32 contestants, said before going on stage she had been practicing her performance at home in front of the mirror.

Biegun's arrival came a day after North Korea said it made another ""crucial test"" at a rocket launch site to develop a strategic weapon to deter U.S. nuclear threats.
Analysts said such tests could help North Korea build more reliable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the United States.
Biegun did not make any comments upon arrival at an airport near Seoul on Sunday afternoon.
Biegun plans to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Monday, as part of his three-day stay before leaving for Tokyo to consult with his Japanese counterpart. It is unclear whether he will meet with North Korean officials at the inter-Korean border.
Biegun’s trip led to speculation he might try to salvage negotiations by reaching out to North Korea, or by publicly sending a message.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump met three times since last year to negotiate an end to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, but there has been scant progress.
North Korea has vowed to take an unspecified “new path” if the United States fails to address its demands before the end of the year.
Tension has been rising in recent weeks as Pyongyang has conducted a series of weapons tests and stepped up criticism of the United States, stoking fears the two countries could return to a collision course that they had been on before launching diplomacy last year.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - United States captain Tiger Woods led from the front as the Americans dominated the Sunday singles to overhaul the Internationals at Royal Melbourne 16-14 and claim an eighth successive Presidents Cup.
Woods clinched a record 27th win in the event with a 3&2 victory over Abraham Ancer to fire up his team and then beamed from the sidelines as they landed crushing early blows before sealing the Cup with a match to spare.
""We did it together. We came here as a team. My team mates and my boys all played well, the captains did an amazing job,"" a thrilled Woods said after the Americans sewed up their 11th win in the 13th Cup.
""It's been one of the more amazing challenges but ... all the guys, they believed in one another and relied on one another.""
Matt Kuchar rolled in the winning putt from just over five feet on the 17th as he halved his match with Louis Oosthuizen.
Rickie Fowler halved the final match with Marc Leishman in front of a deflated gallery as the United States won eight of the 12 points on offer in a stinging Sunday reverse for the Internationals, who had led 10-8 overnight.
No team had won after trailing into the final day but the class and depth of the Americans prevailed when it mattered most.
""We were right there to the end ... Just a couple of matches didn't quite go our way,"" rued Internationals captain Ernie Els.
""We're getting closer. We've just got to keep it up.""
It has now been 21 years since the Internationals claimed their sole win, that victory coming at Royal Melbourne in 1998.
'AMAZING GOLF'
Woods's win over Ancer brought his record at the biennial event to 27 victories, 15 losses and one halved match in his ninth appearance as a player, eclipsing compatriot Phil Mickelson's 26-16-13 tally.
At 43 the youngest captain in the event's 25-year history and only the second playing skipper, Woods finished with an unblemished 3-0-0 record for the week.
Dustin Johnson crushed Chinese debutant Li Haotong 4&3 before Patrick Reed, under pressure after losing all three of his previous matches, pushed his team in front with a 4&2 win over Taiwan's C.T. Pan.
Reed had his swing coach Kevin Kirk carrying his bag after his brother-in-law caddie was ejected from the event for clashing with a spectator on Saturday.
The Texan charged out of the blocks with six birdies in the opening seven holes before Pan trimmed the American's six-hole lead to two by the 13th.
""The last couple of days were tough and today wasn't easy,"" said Reed, who was heckled throughout the event for a controversial penalty in the Bahamas last week.
""I played some amazing golf but he put the pressure right back on me.""
The Internationals' cause suffered a crushing blow when Hideki Matsuyama, having charged to a four-hole lead against Tony Finau, collapsed on the back nine and collected only a half-point.

Adam Scott, condemned to a ninth defeat in nine Cup appearances, lost 2&1 to Xander Shauffele before Webb Simpson beat South Korean An Byeong-hun by the same margin, slamming the door shut on the Internationals' hopes of victory.
The only suspense left was whether the Internationals could win the last three matches to grab a share of the Cup for the first time since 2003.
Australian Cameron Smith held up his end of the bargain with a 2&1 win over Justin Thomas but Oosthuizen squandered a two-hole lead to allow Kuchar to extend the Americans' reign."

(Reuters) - Passengers on a Qantas Airways Ltd flight evacuated their plane via emergency slides at Australia's Sydney airport on Sunday after the flight was forced to turn around.
In a statement, Qantas said flight QF575 to Perth returned to Sydney shortly after takeoff due to a hydraulic issue.
""Once back at the gate, the captain made the decision to evacuate the aircraft as a precaution and three emergency slides were deployed,"" the statement said.
Qantas said engineers were inspecting the aircraft, an Airbus A330-200 that can carry up to 271 passengers.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported that the plane was stuck on the tarmac after landing and smoke began to fill the cabin.
""We were on the runway waiting to be towed in and we started to smell burning,"" the ABC quoted passenger Dillon Parker as saying.
A Qantas spokeswomen told journalists at Sydney airport that it was her understanding that there was mist in the cabin.
""I think perhaps some of the hydraulic fluid was pumped in by the air-conditioning system, I haven't heard of any indications of smoke,"" the spokeswomen said in a televised press conference.
""It may have appeared like smoke but it was mist from the hydraulic system.""
One passenger, Ally Kemp, said on Twitter that the experience was ""terrifying"".
""Just had to evacuate my flight to Perth after engineering issues. Everyone had to exit the plane via slide onto Sydney tarmac after the cabin filled with smoke and the captain screamed evacuate,"" she tweeted."

(Reuters) - New Zealand recovery teams returned to the volcanic White Island on Sunday but were unable to locate two remaining bodies in their search, as the death toll from Monday's eruption rose to 16, police said. 
Authorities said eight police search and rescue staff were deployed for 75 minutes to an area in which their information suggested one body may remain. 
“I can say we have found no further bodies in that area,"" Deputy Police Commissioner Mike Clement told a media conference on Sunday. 
On Friday, six bodies were successfully retrieved from the island by a New Zealand military team and taken to the mainland for disaster victim identification.
Police said they remained committed to recovering the two bodies and that police and military divers were continuing to scour the waters around the island.
“Everyone went out there absolutely desperate to find bodies and return them to loved ones,"" Clement said. 
On Saturday, divers faced contaminated waters and low visibility as they searched the sea surrounding the island.
The volcano, a popular destination for day-trippers, erupted on Monday, spewing ash, steam and gases over the island. Among the 47 people on the island at the time were Australian, U.S., German, Chinese, British and Malaysian tourists.
The death toll rose to 16 on Sunday as one more person died in an Australian hospital. That death is the first to occur in Australia following the eruption, where many of the victims were from and have been transferred.
The toll may rise further as more than two dozen people are still hospitalized across New Zealand and Australia, most with severe burn injuries.
Police on Saturday began formally releasing the names and nationalities of those killed, with 21-year-old Australian Krystal Browitt the first person identified.
On Sunday, police also released the names of New Zealander Tipene Maangi and Australians Zoe Hosking, Gavin Dallow and Anthony Langford.
There has been criticism that tourists were allowed on the island at all, given signs of increasing tremor activity in the days before the eruption.

A minute's silence will be observed in New Zealand on Monday, December 16 at 2.11 p.m. local time (0111 GMT), exactly one week after the fatal eruption occurred.

Morales is in Argentina, granted refugee status this week just days after the inauguration of new President Alberto Fernandez. Peronist Fernandez succeeded outgoing conservative Argentine leader Mauricio Macri, who lost his bid for re-election in October.
Morales had spent the previous month in Mexico in the wake of a highly-contested October election in Bolivia. He had proclaimed victory after his government was accused of manipulating the vote results. Morales, who had been in power nearly 14 years, left Bolivia as the controversy grew.
""He can return whenever he wants. He left because he wanted to,"" Anez told reporters. ""The arrest warrant will be issued in the next few days, because we have already brought the charges.""
Morales had obtained his fourth consecutive term in the October vote, according to the official count, which was criticized for irregularities by the Organization of American States. Morales resigned under pressure from the armed forces in what he has called a coup d'etat."

MADRID (Reuters) - Negotiators worked into the early hours of Sunday to try to salvage a strong global commitment to fight climate change after some of the most vulnerable nations said they were being sidelined at a marathon U.N. summit in Madrid.
Talks were scheduled to conclude on Friday but lurched into a second extra day as major economies and smaller states struggled to resolve outstanding issues under the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle global warming.
Kevin Conrad, Papua New Guinea's climate envoy, told delegates the talks had to be ""open and transparent,"" echoing concerns expressed by some other developing countries that their voices were not being heard.
""Over the last 24 hours, 90% of the participants have not been involved in this process,"" Conrad said.
Carolina Schmidt, a Chilean minister presiding over the two-week annual gathering, appealed to the more than 190 countries in the Paris accord to come together to send a clear signal of support ahead of a crucial implementation phase in 2020.
""We are almost there. It's hard, it's difficult, but it's worth it,"" Schmidt told participants, many of whom had barely slept during the grueling final phase.
Earlier, Chile faced fierce criticism after it drafted a version of the summit text that campaigners complained was so weak it betrayed the spirit of the Paris deal.
Supporters of strong climate action warn the Paris agreement could unravel unless countries at the Madrid summit signal they are ready to honor the deal by rapidly strengthening plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Scientists warn the world will only have a chance of avoiding catastrophic warming if countries move fast to slash emissions under the Paris process, which hinges on parties ratcheting up their targets in 2020.
This summit has revealed a wide gulf between demands for action by an increasingly vociferous global climate activism movement and inertia in major economies, even as carbon dioxide emissions have hit record highs.
The talks in Madrid have become mired in disputes over potential loopholes in rules governing international carbon trading, favored by wealthier countries to reduce the cost of cutting emissions.
Carlos Fuller, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the 44 low-lying nations in the bloc wanted strict rules but were being sidelined as larger countries dominated the talks.
""Are we a party to this process or not?,"" Fuller asked reporters outside a meeting hall.
Schmidt said she was committed to transparency and would personally facilitate attempts to break the deadlock over carbon trading as others worked to resolve another set of disputes over financial aid for poorer countries ravaged by climate impacts."

Asked about the value of beauty contests in today's world of MeToo# and the drive for equality and respect for women, the 23-year-old graduate of Florida State University said beauty for her was the least important aspect of her achievement.
""I want to make a change that's sustainable. So if we're talking women... it needs to be something that will make sure that their children and their children's children have a different value of life,"" an overjoyed Singh told reporters after winning the title in London.
Singh did not specify what kind of change she had in mind.

Describing herself as a ""changed woman"" after the experience of taking part in the Miss World competition, Singh added: ""There's no way I could chalk it up to just being about beauty, because that's the last on the list, honestly.""

In a major overhaul of its pension scheme, the French government has proposed that people work two years longer to get a full pension, drawing a hostile response from trade unions who said they would step up strike action to force an about-face.
The reform-minded CFDT had stayed out of the strike, which has caused travel chaos across the country since Dec. 5. But it said a ""red line"" had been crossed and called on members to join mass protests on Tuesday.
""Let's be clear: CFDT railway workers do not want a blockage during the holidays. Then in January (...) if the text has not changed, the CFDT will continue to mobilize,"" CFDT Secretary General Laurent Berger told Journal du Dimanche.
""We should not make users pay the bill. It would be unbearable if they could not spend this holiday season with their loved ones. We have to break the deadlock,"" he also said.
In contrast, hardline CGT union on Thursday had warned that there would be no break for Christmas unless the government dropped the whole pension reform plan.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told Le Parisien Dimanche he would meet unions next week and asked everyone to take responsibility ahead of Christmas.
""I don't think the French would accept that some people could deprive them of this moment,"" Philippe said.
Junior economy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said on Saturday that the proposal to encourage people to work until 64 through a system of bonuses and discounts could still be negotiated.
French retailers and hoteliers have warned that their crucial Christmas season could be derailed if the transport strike drags on for much longer."

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at Lebanese protesters in central Beirut on Saturday in clashes that went on into the night and wounded dozens of people. 
Hundreds of people had been marching in the capital as part of a historic wave of protests that has swept Lebanon since Oct. 17, furious at a ruling elite that steered the country toward its worst economic crisis in decades. 
Since the protests pushed Saad al-Hariri to resign as prime minister, talks between the main parties have been deadlocked for weeks over forming a new cabinet.
Lebanon urgently needs a new government to pull it out of the crisis. Foreign donors say they will only help after the country gets a cabinet that can enact reforms. 
Riot police and security forces deployed en masse in Beirut on Saturday night, chasing demonstrators, beating and detaining some of them, a Reuters witness and a protester said. 
Plumes of white smoke billowed from tear gas canisters and ambulance sirens rang out as the two sides raced around the streets of central Beirut in cat-and-mouse clashes late into the night.
Protesters pelted stones at police and others tried to push through steel barriers blocking paths to the parliament and government headquarters.
State news agency NNA said the tear gas made several people faint. The Lebanese Civil Defense said it treated 54 people for injuries, taking more than half to hospital. 
The Internal Security Forces said at least 20 police were wounded. 
The unrest erupted in October from a build-up of anger at the rising cost of living, new tax plans and the record of sectarian leaders dominating the country since its 1975-90 civil war. Protesters accuse the political class of milking the state for their own benefit through networks of patronage. 
Lebanon's economic crisis, long in the making, has now come to a head: Pressure has piled on the pegged Lebanese pound. A hard currency crunch has left many importers unable to bring in goods, and banks have restricted dollar withdrawals.

ROME (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people joined a demonstration in central Rome on Saturday organized by a grassroots movement known as ""the sardines"", launched only a month ago to protest against far-right leader Matteo Salvini.
The sardines began in the city of Bologna in November when Mattia Santori, 32, and three friends invited people to protest against Salvini's League, whose popularity is high ahead of an election in the northern Emilia-Romagna region.
Salvini hopes to lead a resurgent right to its first poll victory in the wealthy region on Jan. 26. He says that if the left loses power there, it should also quit the coalition government in Rome and open the way for a national ballot.
Students, pensioners and families with children filled Rome's Piazza San Giovanni on a sunny afternoon, some holding pictures of sardines on cardboard and chanting a popular resistance song.
""I'm here because I'm against Salvini and I'm against the right and I want to see how many people feel like me,"" said Flavia Simula, a 68-year old retired biologist.
Since their maiden protest in Bologna gathered an estimated 15,000 people, the popularity of the ""sardines"" has spread. 
They have held bigger rallies in several Italian cities, including Turin and Milan, to denounce Salvini, whose anti-immigrant, Italy-first rhetoric has resonated with many voters.
The demonstration in Rome appeared to be their largest so far, with a policeman at the scene estimating a turnout of 40,000 people. The organizers gave no official figures.
TARGETING POPULISTS
""Our aim was to fill the square and we managed to do that,"" Santori said. ""The sardines are just people who fill a space with their ideas and who fight an enemy - the simplification of the issues by populists.""
Pollsters say Emilia-Romagna, a leftist stronghold, could fall to the League and its rightist allies following successes in other regional votes, most recently in central Umbria.
They say the right is also likely to win any national vote, with the League seen as Italy's most popular party.
""I am here to say I am against fascism, I consider Salvini a fascist,"" said 18-year old student Luca Baironi.
Salvini has accused the center-left Democratic Party (PD) of being behind the movement and dismissed the protests, saying he likes kittens because ""they eat sardines"".
The sardines deny any political affiliation and say they just want to register their opposition to populist forces gaining strength after a decade of economic stagnation.
Santori said on Saturday 99% of the group's sympathizers did not want the sardines to become a party. ""We don't want to replace political movements,"" he said. 
The ruling 5-Star Movement was born out of a street protest in Bologna in 2007. It triumphed in last year's national election but support has dropped sharply since it forged a government first with the League, then the PD.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2019 04:47PM ET</span>",Anger erupts at U.N. climate summit as major economies resist bold action,"By Matthew Green and Valerie Volcovici
MADRID (Reuters) - Major economies resisted calls for bolder climate commitments as a U.N. summit in Madrid limped toward a delayed conclusion on Saturday, dimming hopes that nations will act in time to stop rising temperatures devastating people and the natural world.
With the two-week gathering spilling into the weekend, campaigners and many delegates slammed Chile, presiding over the talks, for drafting a summit text that they said risked throwing the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle global warming into reverse.
""At a time when scientists are queuing up to warn about terrifying consequences if emissions keep rising, and school children are taking to the streets in their millions, what we have here in Madrid is a betrayal of people across the world,"" said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a climate and energy think-tank in Nairobi.
The annual climate marathon had been due to conclude on Friday, but dragged on with ministers mired in multiple disputes over implementing the Paris deal, which has so far failed to stem the upward march of global carbon emissions.
Long-time participants in the talks expressed outrage at the unwillingness of major polluters to show ambition commensurate with the gravity of the climate crisis, after a year of wildfires, cyclones, droughts and floods.
The European Union, small island states and many other nations had been calling for the Madrid decision to signal that the more than 190 countries participating in the Paris process will submit bolder pledges to cut emissions next year.
The agreement enters a crucial implementation phase in 2020, when countries are supposed to ratchet up their ambitions ahead of the next major round of talks in Glasgow.
If big economies such as China, India, Japan, Brazil, Australia and others fail to agree on more meaningful climate action soon, then scientists say already slim hopes of averting catastrophic temperature rises will all but vanish.
'STRONG MESSAGE'
Although no advanced economy is yet on track for the kind of action scientists say is needed to steer the climate onto a safer path, all the EU's 28 member states, bar Poland, agreed in Brussels on Thursday to target net zero emissions by 2050.
Krista Mikkonen, Finland's environment minister, speaking on behalf of the EU, told the talks it would be ""impossible to leave"" without agreeing on a ""strong message"" on the need to redouble pledges to cut emissions next year.
Ministers broke into groups on Saturday for eleventh-hour negotiations on a tangle of issues, including finance for climate-vulnerable countries, carbon markets and the all-important issue of the strength of the summit's final text.
With the clock ticking, Andrés Landerretche, Chile's summit coordinator, said the goal was to conclude on Saturday. ""The vast majority of delegations are asking for a more ambitious text, and that's what we're aiming at,"" he told reporters.
Campaigners had said a draft text circulating earlier was among the worst they had seen at climate negotiations.
""The approach Chile has taken on this text shows how it has listened to the polluters and not to the people,"" said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International.
The Paris process has been weakened by a move by U.S. President Donald Trump to begin withdrawing the world's largest historical emitter from the agreement last month, making it easier for other big countries to backslide."

MADRID (Reuters) - Green activists dumped horse manure and staged a mock hanging outside the venue of a U.N. climate summit in Madrid on Saturday, airing their frustration at the failure of world leaders to take meaningful action against global warming.
Led by grassroots group Extinction Rebellion, the actions were timed to coincide with the closing of the COP25 summit, where negotiators have been unable to agree on how to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
""Just like rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic, this COP’s fiddling of carbon accounting and negotiating of Article 6 is not commensurate to the planetary emergency we face,"" Extinction Rebellion said in a statement. 
Twelve members of the group stood on melting blocks of ice, nooses drawn tight around their necks to symbolize the 12 months remaining until the next summit, when the Paris deal enters a make-or-break implementation phase.
Attached to the pile of manure was a short message to leaders saying ""the horseshit stops here."" 
In contrast to a protest held last weekend, in which hundreds of demonstrators blocked one of Madrid's central shopping streets for a mass disco-dance, the mood at the gathering was subdued.
""Even if they reach an agreement it's still not enough. This is the 25th COP they've had and nothing has really changed,"" protester Emma Deane told Reuters from her perch atop an ice block, holding her young daughter in her arms. 
""She's going to grow up in a world where there's no food on the shelves and that breaks my heart."" 
Still, Extinction Rebellion spokesman Ronan McNern stressed the importance of humor in the face of the climate crisis. 

""Out of shit comes the best roses. We hope that the international community comes together to create a beautiful future,"" McNern said.

With the cash-strapped government facing significant debt maturities in 2020, farmers had been expecting an increase in export taxes on crops such as soybeans, wheat and corn. Growers, already harried by high financing costs in the inflation-racked country, where the benchmark interest rate is at 63%, had been dreading the expected increase in grains export taxes. 
""Given the serious situation that public finances are going through, urgent adoption is necessary to meet, at least partially, budget expenditures with new resources,"" the decree stated.
Reuters contacted representatives of the ministries of economy and agriculture to obtain details of the measure, but the officials declined to comment on the technicalities of the decree, which said the tax on corn and wheat of 4 pesos per export dollar would no longer be in effect.
The government office that registers grains exports will be closed on Monday while the new tax structure is put in place.
""I understand that there was an increase in grains export taxes. What we do not know is in what magnitude because there are several ways to make the formulas. The decree is not clear,"" Carlos Iannizzotto, head of Coninagro, one of Argentina's main farm groups, told Reuters.
""It fills us with questions because in a context of no economic growth and high inflation, a measure like this is out of order,"" he said. ""It is not a good start.""
Argentina is the world's No. 3 corn and soybean exporter as well as its top supplier of soymeal livestock feed.
The country's new agriculture minister, former left-leaning congressman Luis Basterra, was sworn in on Tuesday after Peronist President Alberto Fernandez was inaugurated to replace free-markets advocate Mauricio Macri, who failed to win re-election due to the unpopularity of his tight fiscal policies.
Basterra's appointment was met with some scepticism by farmers worried about increased state intervention in the markets under the new Peronist administration. 
Chief among farmers' concerns has been the threat of grains export tax increases needed to close the country's fiscal gap. 
The drive to increase tax revenue was sanctioned under a $57 billion standby loan deal that Macri signed with the International Monetary Fund calling for Argentina to wipe out its primary fiscal deficit.
Fernandez says the IMF deal will have to be reworked while his government heads into bond restructuring talks.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Albanian prosecutors have issued a series of arrest warrants on charges including murder and abuse of office over the deaths of 51 people killed when a 6.4-magnitude earthquake toppled dozens of buildings last month, police said on Saturday.
Police and prosecutors said initial investigations showed ""the loss of life in the collapsed buildings came also because their builders, engineers and owners had failed to observe the rules, norms and standards of safe constructions.""
Prosecutors issued 17 warrants in total, police said. Two of the nine people detained on Saturday on murder charges were the owners of two hotels that collapsed, killing four people in Durres, Albania's second-biggest city and main port.
A third was the manager of a police vacation hotel where a high-ranking police officer was killed under the rubble.
During the three decades since toppling communism in 1990, many Albanians have moved nearer cities, squatting on land and building with little supervision by authorities.
Many of the buildings have been legalized since then by governments eager to get votes but also seeking to urbanize such areas by putting in sewage systems and roads.
Both hotels on the 10-mile long beach on the Adriatic Sea south of Durres port were built illegally, police said, and the second had also been legalized illegally.
Police said that some of the 17 people being sought by prosecutors had fled after the Nov. 26 quake.
The high-rises built during the post-Communist boom along the beach are mostly apartments and hotels catering to both Albanians and foreigners, including ethnic Albanians from the Balkans and the Diaspora. Most suffered no damage.
Albania has yet to calculate the cost of rebuilding housing for the 14,000 people left homeless by the quake."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The European Union should spend more than the 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) already allotted to fund Syrian refugees in Turkey, and speed up the flow of that money, the Turkish foreign ministry's EU point person said on Saturday. 
EU funds support the roughly 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, after Syria's more than eight year war killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions from their homes. In turn, Turkey has agreed to halt further immigration to Europe. 
""The flow of funds should be sped up and the amount of funding should be increased,"" said Faruk Kaymakci, a deputy Turkish minister of foreign affairs. 
""As long as the crisis is there we have to work together. The 6 billion euros will not solve the problem when it is finally all spent,"" Kaymakci told reporters in Istanbul.
The EU, which set up the funding in 2015, says more than 5.6 billion euros have been allocated, more than 3.5 billion contracted and more than 2.4 billion disbursed.
Kaymakci said hosting the refugees costs Turkey some $40 billion in total.
Europe's relations with Turkey are strained on several fronts including disagreement over a Turkish military incursion in October against a Kurdish militia in northeast Syria. 

Turkey in late October threatened to ""open the gates"" to allow refugees into Europe unless Europeans back its plan to resettle them in northeast Syria.

KOLKATA/LUCKNOW (Reuters) - Demonstrators in eastern India set fire to more than a dozen buses and vandalized at least six railway stations on Saturday, as violent protests against a new citizenship law continued for a fourth straight day.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says the new law will save religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians from persecution in neighboring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan by offering them a path to Indian citizenship. But critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, weakens the secular foundations of India.
The law's enactment has stirred up protests across India, but the eastern part of the country, where movements against Bangladeshi immigrants have raged for decades, has been among the worst hit.
On Saturday, protesters torched at least 15 buses on an expressway in West Bengal state, some 20 km (12 miles) from state capital Kolkata, holding up traffic for several hours, two police officials said.
At least half a dozen railway stations in the state were vandalized and set on fire, leading to the cancellation of many long-distance trains, Sanjoy Ghosh, chief public relations Officer at South Eastern Railway told Reuters, adding it was difficult to say when normal services would resume.
In India's most populous Uttar Pradesh state, in the north of the country, students at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), a prominent institution set up in 1920, protested against the citizenship law and were mobilizing Muslims via doorstep invitations for a bigger protest on Sunday.
""With the passing of this bill the Muslim community is scared and this bill, which is now a law, is discriminatory in nature,"" said Sharjeel Usmani, an undergraduate student at AMU. ""We will protest against it till it is taken back.""
Protests were also staged in several other towns and cities of Uttar Pradesh, including in the Hindu holy city of Prayagraj, whose former name Allahabad was changed by the state's Hindu nationalist government in 2018.
In the heart of India's capital New Delhi, hundreds of students gathered within and outside the gates of the Jamia Milia University, making speeches and holding peaceful protests against the citizenship law amid a heavy police presence.
Police on Friday fired tear gas and used baton charges to disperse scores of students demonstrating at Jamia.
The university on Saturday also declared a 20-day winter break beginning Dec. 16, according to an official notice reviewed by Reuters.

The annual break at Jamia usually begins around Dec. 24 and the decision to go on an early break was taken due to the student protests, a Jamia staff member said, declining to be named.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A Sudanese court on Saturday convicted former president Omar al-Bashir on corruption charges and sentenced him to two years of detention in a reform facility, the first ruling against the ex-leader ousted by mass unrest. 
The presiding judge said Bashir, 75, who was deposed by the military in April following months of street protests against his three-decade rule, was being sent to the reform facility, rather than a prison, on account of his age. 
He also ordered the confiscation of millions of euros and Sudanese pounds found in Bashir's residence when he was toppled. The charges, which included possession of illicit foreign currency, carried a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. 
Bashir's prosecution is a test of how fast and how far military and civilian authorities now sharing power in Sudan will act to overturn his legacy.
Bashir is also wanted by the International Criminal Court, which issued arrest warrants against him in 2009 and 2010 on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's restive Darfur region. 
Dressed in traditional white robes and a turban, Bashir watched silently from inside a metal defendant's cage while the judge, Al-Sadiq Abdelrahman, read out the verdict.
""The convict, Omar al-Bashir, is consigned to a social reform facility for a period of two years...The sums of foreign and national currency that were seized are confiscated,"" Abdelrahman said. 
The Sudanese Professionals Association, which spearheaded protests earlier this year, welcomed the verdict as a ""political and moral condemnation"" of Bashir and his regime, while noting that it was only one of several cases against the former president and his allies.
APPEAL
From early morning, troops and military vehicles were deployed in the center of the capital Khartoum, blocking access to the presidential palace and the Defence Ministry, and there was a heavy security presence at the court.
About 3,000 supporters of the ex-president's Islamist movement rallied in the center of the city. ""Today we went out to demonstrate to defend Islamic religion and against secularism,"" said 34-year-old protester Ahmed Yassin.
Ahmed Ibrahim al-Tahir, Bashir's lead defense lawyer, said he would appeal. ""The judge made the ruling based on political motives, but despite that we still have confidence in the Sudanese judiciary,"" Tahir told reporters.
Several other judicial cases have been launched in Sudan against Bashir. In May he was charged with incitement and involvement in the killing of protesters, and this week he was summoned for questioning over his role in the 1989 military coup that brought him to power.
Authorities running Sudan under a three-year, power-sharing deal struck in August are eager to demonstrate progress in the country's political transition ahead of the first anniversary of the start of the uprising against Bashir.
On Friday, the Sudanese military officer in charge of removing the powers of the old regime announced that Sudan's bar association and trade union governing bodies were being dissolved, according to state news agency SUNA.
He also announced that a committee was being formed to dissolve the assets of Bashir's National Congress Party.
Protests triggered by a deepening economic crisis began to spread across Sudan on Dec. 19, 2018.

Nearly four months later, a group of military generals removed Bashir from power and jailed him in Khartoum's Kobar prison where he had incarcerated thousands of opponents of his repressive rule.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of people joined Bangkok's biggest protest since a 2014 coup on Saturday, after authorities in Thailand moved to ban a party that has rallied opposition to the government of former military ruler Prayuth Chan-ocha.
The demonstration, called a day earlier by Future Forward party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a 41-year-old billionaire, revived memories of the spasms of street protest that have roiled Bangkok periodically over the past two decades of turbulent politics.
But there was no sign of a major police presence or attempt to block the biggest demonstration since Prayuth seized power in 2014 in the name of ending street violence.
""This is just the beginning,"" Thanathorn told the cheering crowd that spilled across walkways and stairways close to the MBK Centre, in the heart of Bangkok's shopping and business district.
""Today is a show of strength so that in future others may join us. We're just here today as a test run. Prayuth, don't be afraid yet. The real thing is next month.""
Thanathorn has emerged as the most outspoken opponent of the government headed by Prayuth, 65, since an election in March that the opposition said were manipulated to favor the army.
Thailand's election panel has asked the Constitutional Court to dissolve the Future Forward Party, accusing it of infringing laws governing political parties by accepting multi-million dollar loans from Thanathorn. 
Last month, the Constitutional Court found Thanathorn guilty of holding shares in a media company on the date his candidacy was registered for the election, disqualifying him as a member of parliament. Thanathorn disputed the ruling. 
At the protest, demonstrators chanted ""Long live democracy, dictatorship get out"".
Thanathorn earlier signed an agreement with six parties in an opposition alliance to push for changes to the constitution that was drawn up by the junta before the election.
He also won their support for the protest.
Among those parties was Pheu Thai, which won the most seats in the 500-member House of Representatives lower house but has taken a lower profile in challenging the government than Future Forward, which came third in the election.

Palang Pracharat, the pro-military party formed last year by members of the junta's cabinet, came second. Prayuth told reporters on Friday it was inappropriate to organize a demonstration toward the end of the year.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2019 06:56AM ET</span>",North Korea conducted another crucial test at satellite launch site: KCNA,"By Heekyong Yang and Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said it had successfully conducted another test at a satellite launch site on Friday to bolster its strategic nuclear deterrence, North Korean state media outlet KCNA reported on Saturday. 
The test was conducted at the Sohae satellite launch site, KCNA said, citing a spokesman for North Korea's Academy of Defence Science, without specifying what sort of testing occurred.
It was the second such test at the facility in a week. 
KCNA on Sunday said that North Korea had carried out a ""very important"" test on Dec. 7 at the Sohae satellite launch site, a rocket-testing facility that U.S. officials once said North Korea had promised to close.
That KCNA report called the Dec. 7 event a ""successful test of great significance"". South Korea's defense minister Jeong Keong-doo said it was an engine test.
The reported tests come ahead of a year-end deadline North Korea has put forth for the United States to drop its insistence on unilateral denuclearization.
Pyongyang has warned it could take a ""new path"" amid the stalled talks with the United States. The top U.S envoy for North Korea is set to arrive in Seoul on Sunday for meetings with South Korean officials.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Friday said the United States will be ""tested soon"" on bringing North Korea back to the negotiating table. 
""They (North Korea) are still doing training, they do short range ballistic missile tests that we are also concerned about.
""We watch closely as do South Korea and Japan ... the State Department is trying to get them to the table, because the only way forward is through a diplomatic and political agreement,"" Esper said at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations. 
REMINDER
Analysts said such tests could help North Korea build more reliable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
""The point seems to be to remind the United States that North Korea still has space to qualitatively advance its program,"" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Federation of American Scientists.
""We had a good hint that whatever they were doing at Sohae was military in nature when the Academy of Defence Science took charge of the announcement, as opposed to NADA, their space agency,"" Panda added.
Tension has been rising in recent weeks as Pyongyang has conducted weapons tests and waged a war of words with U.S. President Donald Trump, stoking fears that tensions between the two countries could return.
""Considering the fact that North Korea said the 7-minute test conducted last night was to bolster the strategic nuclear deterrence, the test would likely be related to ICBMs, which North Korea considers a strategic weapon to defend itself from adversaries including the United States,"" Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongguk University in Seoul told Reuters. 
""North Korea is close to issuing an ultimatum toward the United States to come to the negotiating table with new calculations or to return to developing nuclear weapons,"" Koh added. 

Stephen Biegun, U.S. special envoy for North Korea, will arrive in South Korea on Sunday, Seoul and Washington said on Friday.

Asked at the Doha Forum in Qatar if he would step down in 2020, the world's oldest prime minister said he wanted to fix problems that he said had been left by the previous government before resigning. 
""I promised I would step down once I resolve some of the major problems that have been left by the previous government. I promised I would step down and give the leadership to a candidate named by the coalition,"" he said.
Mahathir, 94, did not say when he intended to leave office.
On Tuesday, he promised to hand over power to Anwar, in spite of new sexual assault allegations against him, and that he could be ready to do that after a summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries that Malaysia is to host in November 2020. 
Asked if Anwar was the best person to succeed him as prime minister and if he would endorse him, Mahathir said he could not guarantee who would be the best person because of past bad experiences. 
""I have named my successors and then they took over and did different things.""
Mahathir was unexpectedly elected in 2018 as the head of a coalition government whose largest party is led by Anwar, 72, who has been jailed twice on separate counts of sodomy and for corruption - charges he said were political.

NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi thronged the streets of the capital Naypyitaw on Saturday to celebrate her arrival back from The Hague, where she defended the country against genocide charges.
The Nobel laureate waved as her black car drove slowly past crowds who waved flags, held up pictures of her face and shouted jubilant greetings.
""Mother Suu went to the court on behalf of the country,"" local farmer Khin Maung Shwe told Reuters. ""Actually the accusation was against the army. But she took the first step of responsibility as a leader of the nation.""
Gambia has accused Myanmar of violating the 1948 Genocide Convention over a military campaign that drove more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar. It has asked the International Court of Justice to order ""provisional measures"" to prevent more harm.
Suu Kyi led a team to the Netherlands for three days of hearings, during which she denied genocide and argued the U.N. court should not have jurisdiction.
""Myanmar requests the court to remove the case from its list,"" Suu Kyi said on the final day of hearings on Thursday. ""In the alternative (the court should) reject the request for provisional measures submitted by the Gambia.""
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate's surprise decision to attend the hearings in person has dealt a further blow to her tarnished international reputation.
Suu Kyi was long feted in the West as a champion of human rights and democracy, and was a high-profile political prisoner during 15 years of house arrest for her opposition to Myanmar's then ruling military junta.
But her stance on the Rohingya issue has seen her stripped of many awards, calls for the Nobel committee to revoke her peace prize and strong criticism from former celebrity supporters and other organizations.
At home however, Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmar's founding father Aung San, is still revered by many.
The proceedings in the Hague have galvanized supporters, who have staged rallies across the country chanting ""Stand with Suu Kyi"" and waving flags."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The South Pacific island nation of Samoa on Saturday extended a state of emergency due to a measles outbreak which has killed 72 people, mostly infants, as New Zealand announced NZ$1 million ($640,700) to help combat measles in the Pacific.
Samoa said a state of emergency will be extended to Dec. 29 with 5,154 cases of measles now reported since the outbreak started in October. Samoa has a population of only 200,000.
Measles started appearing en masse earlier this year in the New Zealand city of Auckland, a hub for travel to and from small South Pacific islands.
The majority of those who have died in Samoa due to the highly infectious disease have been aged four and under. The island nation had a far lower vaccination rate than its regional neighbors.
Following a mandatory immunization campaign, the Samoan government said approximately 93% of all eligible people in Samoa have now been vaccinated against measles.
""Prevention through vaccination is the most effective way of avoiding illness and a costly health emergency,"" New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a statement announcing the funding.
Under the plan, children under five and new mothers and their families will be targeted for vaccination. The funding would be directed to the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
WHO has described the fact children die from a vaccine-preventable disease as a ""collective failure"" to protect the world’s most vulnerable children. 
The organization said measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, it said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase in case numbers compared with the same period in 2018.
Measles epidemics have occurred this year in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal wants to review a military deal allowing its citizens to be enlisted in the British army, before a planned recruitment of Nepali women in the Brigade of Gurkhas for the first time in two centuries, the Himalayan country's foreign minister said.
It is not clear how many Gurkha women Britain plans to enlist, but the first Gurkha women could begin their training in the British army in 2020, according to British media.
Britain has been enlisting Gurkhas, a tribe from Nepal's Himalayan foothills known for their fierce combat abilities, since 1815.
An agreement between New Delhi, London and Kathmandu following India's independence from colonial rule in 1947 allowed India and Britain to share and recruit Gurkhas.
In 2007, Britain announced plans to recruit Gurkha women for its elite force, adding however that issues such as recruitment and selection standards needed to be settled.
Nepal now wants the 72-year-old tripartite deal renegotiated since that accord does not allow Kathmandu to play any role in the recruitment process of Gurkhas by foreign armies, the country's Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali told Reuters in an interview late on Friday.
""(Some) provisions of that agreement have become irrelevant now. Therefore, we have told Britain that we should review it ... make bilateral arrangements,"" said Gyawali.
""We should define the presence of the government of Nepal in the (recruitment) process.""
A new agreement should also address Gurkha grievances such as pensions and other benefits, which retired servicemen say are not at par with their British counterparts, Gyawali added.
Nepal, a natural buffer between China and India, is one of the world's 10 poorest countries and remittances from Nepalis working abroad, including the Gurkhas, account for more than a quarter of its GDP.
Currently, there are about 3,000 Nepalis in the Brigade of Gurkhas who have fought in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans."

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand divers searched contaminated waters near the volcanic White Island for two remaining bodies on Saturday, as the death toll from an eruption rose to 15 people, the police said.
Waters around the island were contaminated by the massive eruption of rocks, lava and chemicals on Monday, reducing visibility.
""Divers have reported seeing a number of dead fish and eels washed ashore and floating in the water,"" police said in a statement. ""Each time they surface, the divers are decontaminated using fresh water.""
The remains of six people were successfully recovered on Friday after a military team in gas masks and hazmat suits landed on the uninhabited island and removed the bodies in a high-risk operation.
Police said they could not retrieve the remains of two more people, but spotted at least one body in the waters not too far from the island shoreline.
Nine police dive squad members resumed their search at 7.00 a.m. local time (1800 GMT Friday) and the operation would be boosted by a navy dive team later in the day.
The police said in an earlier statement they will not return to the island for a land-based search on Saturday, but will return in the future.
""Today's planning will allow us to return to the island to conduct further land-based searches for the remaining deceased, as the environment on and around the island allows,"" police said. ""There will be no return to the island today.""
In a statement released on Saturday, geological agency GeoNet said there was a 35% to 50% risk of an eruption that would impact beyond the volcano’s vent area in the next 24 hours. A decrease from the 50% and 60% risk announced on Friday.
The volcano, a popular tourist destination for day-trippers, erupted on Monday, spewing ash, steam and gases over the island. Among the 47 people on the island at the time were Australian, U.S., German, Chinese, British and Malaysian tourists.
The death toll rose to 15 on Saturday as one more person died in the hospital. The toll may rise further as more than two dozen people are still hospitalized across New Zealand and Australia, most with severe burn injuries.
There has been criticism that tourists were allowed on the island at all, given signs of increasing tremor activity in the days before the eruption.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Saturday that a minute’s silence will be observed at 2.11 p.m. local time (0111GMT) on December 16, exactly one week from when the fatal eruption occurred.
“Wherever you are in New Zealand, or around the world, this is a moment we can stand alongside those who have lost loved ones in this extraordinary tragedy,” Ardern said in the statement."

""The content he expressed is entirely Ozil's personal opinion,"" the official account of Arsenal Football Club said in a post on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform. ""As a football club, Arsenal always adheres to the principle of not being involved in politics.""
Ozil's posts called Uighurs ""warriors who resist persecution"" and criticized both China's crackdown and the silence of Muslims in response.
""(In China) Qurans are burned, mosques were closed down, Islamic theological schools, madrasas were banned, religious scholars were killed one by one. Despite all this, Muslims stay quiet,"" Ozil, who is a Muslim, said in his posts.
The club's Twitter account did not have a post addressing Ozil's comments as of Saturday afternoon.
But replies to Arsenal's Weibo post were angry, with one showing a shredded Ozil soccer jersey next to a pair of scissors and others demanding he be expelled from the club.
A search on Weibo for the hashtag translatable as ""Ozil issues inappropriate statement"", which had been one of the top trending topics on the platform, returned no results on Saturday afternoon.
Weibo frequently censors discussion of sensitive topics, particularly amid a push by Beijing to clean up its internet.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions in Xinjiang as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam visited Beijing on Saturday for her first trip to the Chinese capital since her government was handed a crushing defeat in local elections last month, prompting speculation about changes to her leadership team.
During a four-day visit, Lam is due to discuss the political and economic situation in China-ruled Hong Kong with Chinese officials. She will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday.
Hong Kong has been convulsed by daily and sometimes violent protests for the last six months as demonstrations against a now-withdrawn extradition bill broadened into demands for greater democratic freedom.
Hundreds of thousands of people marched last Sunday to protest against what is seen as Beijing undermining freedoms guaranteed when the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997. Many young protesters are also angry at Lam's government, charging it with failing to address social inequality issues in one of the world's most expensive cities.
""Our sincerity to have dialogue with citizens has not changed,"" Lam said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Saturday. She said her governing team would continue to pursue ""different formats of dialogue to listen to citizens sincerely.""
This week Lam said a cabinet reshuffle was not an ""immediate task"" and she would focus her efforts on restoring law and order to Hong Kong. Still there are doubts about how long Beijing is willing to back her, especially after pro-democracy candidates won nearly 90% of the seats in district elections last month.
China has condemned the unrest and blamed foreign interference. It denies that it is meddling in Hong Kong's affairs. In an editorial this week, the official China Daily newspaper called on Hong Kong's government to uphold the rule of law.
Separately, three men were arrested on Saturday and charged with testing remote-controlled explosives, police said. Police also found body armor, shields and gas masks, they said.
Police also arrested five teenagers in connection with the murder of a 70-year-old man last month and on rioting charges, the government said. The man had been hit with bricks and later died in hospital, the government said in a statement."

Taiwan holds presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 11, and campaigning is in full swing with the Kuomintang challenging the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party of President Tsai Ing-wen, who is currently far ahead in the polls.
The device, planted outside the entrance to a Kuomintang office in Tainan city, contain wires, liquid and powder, the report said.
Police tracked a suspect, a man with the family name Wu, to the neighboring city of Kaohsiung and after a lengthy stand-off stormed a building and shot the man, who was taken to hospital, it said.
Taiwan elections are passionate, noisy affairs, but generally pass off peacefully.
In 2004, then-president Chen Shui-bian of the DPP won re-election by a thin margin after a bullet grazed him and his running mate at a campaign event. The Kuomintang said at the time that incident was staged to win votes.
The Kuomintang favors close ties with China, which considers Taiwan to be merely a Chinese province and claims it as its sacred territory. The DPP favors the island's formal independence."

MADRID (Reuters) - Big polluting countries faced last-ditch pressure from smaller nations to show serious commitment to fighting climate change as negotiators battled into the early hours of Saturday to salvage a result from a fraught U.N. summit in Madrid.
With the two-week gathering mired in interlocking disputes over how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement on global warming, Chile, presiding over the talks, had earlier attempted to inject a note of optimism.
""Today is the day when we must show the world that we are capable of delivering the agreements that are needed to tackle the unprecedented challenge before us,"" Andrés Landerretche, a Chilean official, told a news conference late on Friday.
Chile later announced the talks, which had been due to end on Friday, would resume at 0700 a.m. (0600 GMT) on Saturday. 
Observers said delegates were struggling to resolve the question of whether big emitters will signal their intent to raise their emissions-cutting targets next year, when the Paris deal enters a make-or-break implementation phase.
""The fate of the Paris Agreement is in the balance,"" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, a London-based think tank.
Fast-growing emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil are reluctant to commit themselves to unveiling new goals so soon, observers say, fearing they will end up paying the price of emissions cuts that should be borne by the rich.
The European Union, whose members, barring Poland, agreed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, is pushing for a more ambitious statement of intent, along with many of the most vulnerable developing countries. 
After two weeks of talks in Madrid, held after months of preparation, ministers were holed up in small groups attempting to break deadlocks over financial aid for states at most risk from climate change, and rules governing carbon markets.
Progress on those issues would help deliver the bigger prize: a clear statement from the gathering that governments are committed to honoring the Paris deal by imminently announcing more ambitious action to wean themselves off fossil fuels.
""There is a very big question on the commitment of the parties to the Paris Agreement,"" said Mohamed Nasr, chair of the Africa bloc of negotiators.
'25 YEARS OF TALKS'
With scientists warning that the window to prevent the Earth's climate hitting irreversible tipping points is fast closing, an increasingly strident activism movement says a strong signal from the summit is the only acceptable outcome.
""We've had 25 years of talks and the only thing that really matters is global emissions are still rising,"" said Tim Crosland, a prominent member of Extinction Rebellion, a civil disobedience campaign, after meeting officials at the talks.
Campaigners are concerned that as negotiations dragged on into the early hours of Saturday, delegates may be tempted to hastily adopt weak resolutions to conclude the marathon.
The talks have been overshadowed since the outset by a formal move by U.S. President Donald Trump to begin withdrawing from the Paris accord last month.
Observers said the U.S. delegation repeated a pattern seen at past talks of blocking progress toward ensuring poor countries can secure compensation for climate-related losses.
But the weight of negotiating effort focused on trying to persuade Australia, Brazil and others to drop their insistence on carrying over credits from old carbon trading schemes.
The EU and small island states say that continuing to count such credits would dramatically weaken the fight to curb emissions.
Brazil has also come under fire for opposing attempts to impose gold standard accounting rules on the carbon trade.

""We don't want any accounting tricks being created here,"" said Sam Van den plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch, an advocacy group. ""It would be a massive disaster ... if we end up with flawed and weak rules.""

Canadian farmers are caught up in a trade and diplomatic dispute between Ottawa and Beijing.
In a formal letter of instruction to Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, Trudeau said she should draw on lessons from recent trade disputes involving exports of canola, beef and pork and work out better ways to respond.
""This should include the ability to provide faster short-term support for industry when required,"" he said.
The Trudeau government is under increased pressure from farm groups who say they need immediate support for producers impacted by trade disputes.
Earlier this year Ottawa extended a federal loan program to offer more financial assistance to canola seed farmers hit by a Chinese import ban. Canada also has started the formal process to challenge China at the World Trade Organization.
In a statement, Bibeau said she would continue to work with industry and her provincial counterparts to advance the priorities outlined in the prime minister's letter, which did not provide any further details.
China temporarily suspended Canadian beef and pork exports for four months over food safety concerns after bogus export certificates were discovered. Exports resumed in November after Canadian officials submitted a plan addressing Beijing's concerns."

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), both unarmed and armed, will start to take off from Gecitkale Airport as of Dec. 16, the privately-held Demiroren news agency reported.
Efforts to base them had taken some time, it said, adding that a team of experts from Ankara considered the airport, also known as Lefkoniko, a suitable option.
Cyprus, an EU member, was divided in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. It has argued with Turkey for years regarding the ownership of fossil fuels in the eastern Mediterranean, thought to be rich in natural gas.
Turkey began seeking oil and gas off the coast of Cyprus earlier this year, dispatching two drill ships and an exploration vessel with UAVs escorting them for monitoring and protection. The European Union calls the activities illegal and has readied sanctions against Turkey in response.
Ankara says that some areas Cyprus operates in are either on the Turkish continental shelf, or in areas where the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state has rights over any finds.
Additional investment will also be made in the airport, Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Ersin Tatar said following the cabinet decision, according to Demiroren news agency.
""The protection of Turkish Cypriot rights and interests is the main priority,"" Tatar was quoted as saying by Demiroren.

The decade-long Islamist insurgency has caused the deaths of some 30,000 people and driven 2 million to flee their homes.
Action Against Hunger said one of its employees, two drivers and three health ministry workers were abducted. In September it said one of the hostages had been killed.
On Friday, the humanitarian agency said the group claimed to have killed four of the remaining five hostages.
""Action Against Hunger condemns these latest killings in the strongest terms and deeply regrets that its calls for the release of the hostages have not been acted upon,"" it said.
It also called for the ""immediate release"" of its staff member, Grace, who remains in captivity."

Funai said in a statement that Dorivan Soares Guajajara was ""brutally assassinated"" along with another non-indigenous man, Roberto do Nascimento Silva. Their bodies were found in the Vila Industrial neighborhood in the municipality of Amarante.
The agency said it is closely following an investigation opened by the local and state-level security forces and awaits further details.
Funai said that local police had dismissed links to land disputes or illegal logging operations in the state, as well as any ethnic motivation, although the location of the crime is near where two other members of the Guajajara were killed six days ago in a drive-by shooting.
That double assassination followed the killing in early November of Paulino Guajajara, a leader of a vigilante group created by the Guajajara to protect the forests from illegal loggers.
Sonia Guajajara, coordinator of APIB, a group that defends indigenous rights in Brazil, denounced the most recent assassination as another example of crimes caused by hate.
""All the people that don't like us feel that they have clearance to kill, because they know that impunity rules,"" she said in a post in Twitter.
""The time has come to say: that's enough,"" she said.
Deforestation has risen sharply in Brazil in the first year of the new government of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.
Some of the areas being targeted by illegal loggers and land grabbers are indigenous territories, such as the Guajajara areas in Maranhão."

But now even she needs a rest.
Fresh from being named Time magazine's Person of the Year, the 16-year-old Swede joined thousands of students in the north Italian city of Turin on Friday for a protest to pressure the government to take more action to curb carbon emissions.
Thunberg, who refuses to fly, travelled to Turin by train and car from Madrid after attending a U.N. climate summit in the Spanish capital. She arrived in Europe only a few days earlier aboard a catamaran after spending months campaigning in the United States.
Now she needs a little downtime.
""I will be home for Christmas and then I will take a holiday break because you need to take rest,"" she told reporters in Turin. 
""Otherwise you cannot do this all the time.""
But the renowned activist showed plenty of energy as she addressed the rally in Turin, the birthplace of carmaker Fiat, in one of Italy's main industrial and polluting regions.
""2019 is almost over. We must make sure that 2020 is the year of action, is the year when we bend the global emissions curve,"" she told the youthful crowd.
""We are going to put pressure on those in power, we are going to make sure that they will act and they will take responsibility.""
When she was 15, Thunberg skipped school on Fridays to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament to push her government to curb carbon emissions. Her campaign gave rise to a grassroots movement called Fridays for Future that has gone global, inspiring millions of people to take action.

""We are very excited to have Greta protesting side-by-side with us,"" said fellow activist Elena Costa, 22, from Turin. ""We want to explain our goals to everyone and invite everyone to come Friday after Friday, every single week.""

BETHLEHEM/GAZA (Reuters) - George Salameh's family has lived in the Palestinian city of Bethlehem for 70 years. Still, he prefers his family be called ""al-Yafawi"", meaning ""of Jaffa"", an ode to the Mediterranean coastal town his family left in 1948 and still considers home. 
Salameh, like many Palestinians whose families were made refugees following the mid-20th century war that surrounded Israel's creation, views his presence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank city as temporary.
Other Palestinian refugees are scattered from the Gaza Strip to Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. Many still hold iron keys which they say belong to homes they fled or were forced to flee amid what Palestinians call the ""Nakba"", or catastrophe, in 1948.
Salameh, 59, now runs a falafel, ful and hummus restaurant, just off Bethlehem's Manger Square (NYSE:SQ). The motto ""since 1948"" is emblazoned on the restaurant's menus and its waiters' shirt sleeves. 
He says his membership card from UNRWA - the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian refugees - guarantees his right under international law to return to his family's home in Jaffa, which now sits in central Israel, some 78 km (nearly 50 miles) away.
The U.N. General Assembly voted on Friday to renew UNRWA's mandate to provide education, health and relief services to more than five million Palestinian refugees across the region.
UNRWA argues its services are needed ""in absence of a solution to the Palestine refugee problem"". 
But Israel refuses the right of return Salameh and other refugees claim, fearing the country would lose its Jewish majority.
Salameh admits his hopes for going back remain dim. 
""We don't believe there will be a right of return. It's like an anaesthetic, it takes the pain away, but it is not a cure,"" Salameh said. 
In the Gaza Strip, Zakeya Moussa says her family once owned 16 acres (6.5 hectares) of land just north of the coastal enclave's fortified border with Israel. 
Moussa, 63, has spent her entire life living in Palestinian refugee camps in the Strip, which Israel has kept under blockade since 2007 citing security concerns from its Islamist rulers Hamas. 
Near Moussa's home in Gaza's Beach refugee camp on the shores of the Mediterranean, Palestinians were unloading sacks of flour they receive from UNRWA, which provides aid to over half of the enclave's two million residents.
""UNRWA gives us flour, plant oil, beans and milk, we get treated for free, we get medication... We are nothing without UNRWA,"" Moussa said.
She says her family's land had a house surrounded by tracts of fruit and vegetable fields, all now north of the Strip's Erez border crossing with Israel. 
Under different circumstances, it would be just a short walk away, she said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's new President Alberto Fernandez briefly swapped duties on Friday, returning to unfinished business at his former job as a college professor overseeing students' final exams.
Fernandez, sworn in on Tuesday, surprised students when he showed up to supervise an exam in his crime and justice class at the University of Buenos Aires, where he was a law professor before launching his presidential bid this year.
Heavy security lined the halls of the law school after Fernandez, 60, arrived by car from the Casa Rosada presidential palace. Dressed in a suit and tie, he sat patiently at the front of his classroom while his students took their hours-long final. When it was over, they posed for a group photo.
""He's no longer a candidate for president, he is the president of the nation. It's historical. This will never happen to me again in my life,"" said student Nadina Tatiana Pasanini.
Fernandez, little-known in the South American country until earlier this year, had kept up his college professor duties during the presidential campaign, culminating in his Oct. 27 triumph against conservative Mauricio Macri, who had been seeking re-election for a second term.
In September, Fernandez traveled to Madrid to teach university classes, an obligation he said he committed to before announcing his candidacy. He had continued to oversee exams until October, when the presidential elections took place.
The brief return to his days as a college professor comes ahead of a crucial moment for Fernandez's administration as he prepares to navigate Argentina out of a severe financial crisis and a looming debt pile that must be renegotiated with global bondholders and the International Monetary Fund.
Fernandez, who won strong support amongst younger voters, has looked to underscore his credentials as a man of the people, including social media post of him playing the guitar and taking his brown and white collie Dylan to vote.
The center-left Peronist also drove himself to his own inauguration in his silver Toyota sedan, waving to the crowds that lined the streets from the driver's side window."

Government spokeswoman Isabel Celaa, who announced the measure at a weekly briefing, said the subsidies will be complemented by 25 million euros from European funds.
Provoked by national crises in Spanish-speaking countries like Venezuela and Colombia, the number of people seeking asylum in Spain has skyrocketed. Madrid City Council received 50,000 asylum applications between January and October 2019 - compared to only 36,000 nationwide and throughout 2018.

Strache led his party into a coalition in 2017 with conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz, but their government collapsed in May when a video surfaced showing Strache at a dinner party in Ibiza offering to fix government contracts while in discussion with a woman posing as a Russian oligarch's niece.
That video sting cost Strache his leadership and contributed to a 10-point fall in support for the FPO in September's parliamentary election, though allegations that Strache improperly claimed lavish expenses from the party also cost it votes. Strache denies any wrongdoing.
The party's leadership has disavowed Strache, whom anti-corruption prosecutors are investigating on suspicion of fraud in connection with the Ibiza video.
""That is what we do not want to be - a party in which there are scandals, a party in which there is a cult of personality. Indeed (we want to be a party) with a strong leader but one who is settled, not loud,"" FPO leader Norbert Hofer said at a news conference announcing Strache's expulsion.
Hofer did not, however, give a clear reason for the decision to expel him.
It is unclear whether Strache, who remains popular with many of the FPO's core supporters, will now found his own rival party and lead it in next year's local elections in Vienna - his home town and a Social Democratic stronghold.
Three Vienna city councillors loyal to Strache left the FPO on Thursday and created their own political grouping within the city's assembly, prompting expectations that Strache would soon join them and turn their grouping into a fully fledged party.
""The enormous support I have received from the public in the past weeks and months encourages me to think about a political comeback in the year 2020,"" Strache said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in response to his expulsion, adding that there are ""deep divisions"" within the party.
""With that, my membership of the FPO is history,"" he said."

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland sees limited room for diplomacy and dialogue with Russia, a senior Polish official said, despite attempts by French President Emmanuel Macron to persuade Warsaw to rethink its relationship with Moscow.
Macron told The Economist magazine in November it was time to rethink Europe's strategic relationship with Russia. He said there was ""some concern"" in Poland about his plan, but he was ""starting to talk to them.""
Poland was in the Soviet sphere of influence for four decades until the collapse of Communist rule, and relations have been strained more recently by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and differences over a plane crash in Russia that killed President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others in 2010.
""Today the room for diplomacy is limited. Room for dialogue is limited,"" Krzysztof Szczerski, a senior presidential aide, told Reuters in an interview this week in which he said Macron was expected to visit Poland in the first half of next year.
""Russian politics could change, it could open the road for wider dialogue, but it would require a shift in conditions. First of all, a departure from the politics of force in the region.""
Russia's lack of willingness to share the wreckage, the black box flight recorders and other evidence from the Smolensk crash site have harmed relations, he added.
""The Russian side's decision to keep the conditions surrounding (the Smolensk crash) a mystery is a weight on relations between Poland and Russia,"" Szczerski said.
Poles are divided over what caused the president's plane to crash while trying to land in fog at Smolensk military airport on April 10, 2010. Most believe it was a tragic accident but some say it was a planned assassination.
Russia has rejected such suggestions and accusations that it mishandled the remains of Kaczynski and other Polish dignitaries who were killed in the crash before they were handed over to Warsaw.
Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine also caused friction and Poland's foreign and defense policy is built largely on deterrence of Russia.
BILATERAL TALKS
At receptions in London during a NATO summit this month, Macron listened to the concerns of eastern European leaders, Szczerski said.
Polish President Andrzej Duda said after meeting Macron at the summit that Russia is ""no enemy"" and described Russia as ""a partner and neighbor.""
Polish officials had previously said Europe should not consider warming ties with Russia. But Szczerski said Macron had not influenced Duda's position at the summit.
""As a country that neighbors Russia we will never push for antagonism in the West's relationship with Russia, because then we can become a victim of that antagonism,"" Szczerski said.
Relations between Poland and France have been fragile in recent years, in part since Poland in 2016 called off a $3.5-billion contract for military multipurpose helicopters from Airbus."

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations General Assembly on Friday overwhelmingly renewed the mandate for a U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees for another three years amid misconduct allegations and a cash shortfall triggered by a halt in U.S. funding.
The mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) was extended until June 30, 2023, with 169 votes in favor and nine abstentions, while the United States and Israel voted against.
UNRWA, which as established in 1949, provides education, health and relief services as well as housing and microfinance assistance to more than 5 million registered refugees in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, as well as in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
The agency has faced budgetary difficulties since last year, when the United States - its biggest donor - halted its aid of $360 million per year. The United States and Israel have both accused UNRWA of mismanagement and anti-Israeli incitement.
The Islamist group Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, hailed the U.N. vote as a defeat for the United States and a failure of its attempts to pressure U.N. member-states against UNRWA.
""We welcome the decision to renew the international mandate to UNRWA and we see it as another failure to hostile U.S. policies to the Palestinian rights,"" Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.
The U.S. mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the vote.
Last month UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl resigned amid an investigation into misconduct allegations. Krahenbuhl has denied wrongdoing and said his agency was the victim of a political campaign designed to undermine it.
Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium suspended payments to UNRWA over the inquiry, deepening the budget crisis set off last year by the United States. UNRWA hopes the management shake-up will help pacify donors, said a source with knowledge of the organization's thinking.
The United States has advocated shifting the agency's relief services to refugee host countries. But UNRWA counters it provides a humanitarian lifeline and that it safeguards and advances Palestinians' rights under international law.
Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official, praised the U.N. vote on Friday and said it was the United Nations' responsibility to combat what she called U.S. and Israeli attacks on Palestinian refugees.
""All attempts at trying to limit UNRWA's mandate or defund it or attack it have failed, and we hope that the international community will continue to come to the rescue,"" she said."

British authorities have sought Eamonn Harrison, 22, on charges of human trafficking and immigration offences, as well as the 39 offences of manslaughter in a case which has shone a light on the illicit human smuggling trade.
Harrison has challenged the order. His lawyer has argued that a lack of information in the warrant about the place of death and how Harrison was involved made it ""fundamentally defective"".
British officials, citing mobile phone analysis, cell tower data, and CCTV footage, allege that Harrison delivered the trailer in which the people were found to a Belgian port before its onward journey to Britain, Ronan Kennedy, a lawyer for the Irish state said on Friday.
Kennedy argued that European Arrest warrants are designed for quick arrests and do not need to be as specific as the defense suggested.
Britain began extradition proceedings on Nov. 1, a week after the discovery of the bodies at an industrial estate.
Irish Judge Donald Binchy had said he wanted to clear all extradition requests by year-end due to the uncertainty over Brexit. But on Friday he said this was no longer such a concern, a reference to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election victory and clear path to approving a divorce deal with the European Union.
Binchy said it would take him some time to consider the submissions and that he would give his judgment on Jan. 24.
The discovery of the bodies in the back of a refrigerated truck after being smuggled into Britain highlighted how poor citizens of Asia, Africa and the Middle East pay large sums of cash to middlemen for perilous, illicit journeys to the West.
Police in Vietnam have arrested 10 people in connection with the deaths. The British driver of the truck has admitted plotting to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property.
Another man from Northern Ireland has been charged with conspiring to arrange the travel of people with a view to their exploitation, and conspiracy to break immigration laws."

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague convicted Lukic in 2009 of war crimes committed during the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and his life sentence was upheld by an appeals court in 2012.
The Bosnian prosecutor issued the indictment for a crime that wasn't covered by the ICTY case after interrogating Lukic in Estonia, where he is serving his life sentence.
Lukic, 52, led a paramilitary group called the White Eagles or Avengers who seized, tortured and executed 20 people, mainly Muslims, from a train passing through Bosnia en route to the Montenegrin port of Bar from Serbia, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
The indictment now goes to Bosnia's state court for confirmation. It was not clear what would happen if the charges were confirmed since Lukic has been jailed for life by the ICTY.
""The court will decide. The court first needs to confirm the indictment,"" a spokesman for the prosecutor's office said.
Convicts sentenced to life by the ICTY can request to be released after serving 30 years.
According to the prosecutor's statement, Lukic's group stopped the train, seized the victims, took them to a school in eastern Bosnia where they were beaten, tortured and robbed, and then took them to a place where Lukic took part in their murder.
""The defendant is accused of personally taking part in planning and ... kidnapping of civilians and their murder on the bank of the Drina River on Feb. 27, 1993,"" the prosecutor's office said, adding that Lukic had been charged with war crimes against the civilian population.
The victims were thrown into the Drina River. The remains of only four people have been found until now, it said.
Lukic is most notorious for barricading 70 Muslim men, women and children in a house in the eastern town of Visegrad in 1992 before setting it on fire, in what became known as the Pionirska Street massacre. He shot at people trying to escape.
Fifteen members of Lukic's group were arrested in Bosnia and Serbia in 2014 and all are being tried at courts in Sarajevo and Belgrade."

Doctors treated only emergency cases and teachers did not show up for the first two teaching hours.
The state is the biggest employer in Kosovo, one of the poorest countries in Europe. State salaries average 520 euros per month compared with 370 euros in the private sector.
Parliament passed the law in February to tackle imbalances within public sector pay, but the court suspended it on Thursday following complains by the country's ombudsman.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had warned Kosovo the law undermined its financial health and competitiveness.
Threats of strikes by state workers will be a major challenge for a new government expected following snap elections in October. Early this year a three-week strike by teachers over wages affected some 500,000 pupils and students.
The 120-seat parliament will hold its first session on December 26 and two biggest parties are still in talks to reach a deal on coalition.
Albin Kurti, who is set to become the next prime minister, said the public sector wages law should be replaced with one which eliminated inequalities more effectively.

The girl, who set fire to the flag at an anti-Beijing rally in September, pleaded guilty to desecrating the flag, RTHK said. Hong Kong has outlawed the desecration of national flags and emblems, crimes that attract jail terms of three years.
While Chinese authorities have striven to foster greater patriotism among citizens in the former British colony, they have met a backlash from protesters who accuse Beijing of encroaching on the freedoms promised to Hong Kong when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The city, a major hub of global finance, has been rocked by six months of often violent demonstrations against a now-withdrawn extradition bill that widened into demands for more democratic freedoms.
The girl's lawyer submitted letters from her secondary school and her football coach urging the court to give her a second chance, RTHK said.
The magistrate told the girl not to expect a lenient sentence if she committed a more serious offence next time, the broadcaster said.
Young people and teenagers have been at the forefront of the Hong Kong protests. Since June, police have arrested people as young as 11 and as old as 84 in connection with the protests.
The protests have regularly featured ranks of riot police firing volleys of tear gas or baton-charging protesters, often in central business or tourist areas. Police in turn have been targets of petrol bombs and other projectiles hurled by often masked protesters.
There have been widespread allegations of police misconduct during the protests. Police have described their actions as reactive and restrained."

The government ended a decade of dollarisation in June, partly to stem demand for the increasingly scarce currency, a decision economists estimate pushed inflation to 440%, eroding wages and savings.
Economists, businesses and the opposition have accused the government of rushing to reintroduce the Zimbabwe dollar without the backing of foreign currency reserves and say it should allow the use of U.S. dollar and other currencies to tame soaring prices.
""No progressive nation can progress without its own currency. However, we have so many among our people, who fight this decision. We will not revert back to a basket of currencies, never, never, never,"" Mnangagwa told ZANU-PF members at an annual party conference outside the capital.
There is little foreign investment in the country, gripped by its worst economic crisis in a decade, and export earnings and remittances from the diaspora have fallen. The resulting shortage of U.S. dollars to pay for imports has led to fuel and electricity shortages, hobbling businesses including in the important mining sector.
Although it is now illegal to use foreign currency to buy local goods, many people still take the risk and some businesses charge in both U.S. and Zimbabwe dollars.
The Zimbabwe dollar has lost 61% of its value against the greenback since its re-introduction. Analysts expect it to weaken further as the government scrambles for U.S. dollars to crank up imports of grain following a severe drought.
Hopes have faded that Mnangagwa, who took over from late President Robert Mugabe after a coup two years ago, can quickly revive the economy, which is on the verge of recession with millions facing hunger.
Mnangagwa said his government was pursuing difficult economic reforms, including measures to reduce the budget deficit to single digits.
He said violent fuel protests witnessed in January and calls by labor unions for strikes over pay were part of an anti-government plot to derail economic reforms and undermine his rule.
""I want to commend the people of Zimbabwe for rejecting the machinations by those with unbridled political ambitions who are even prepared to use violence, divisions and disunity and violent demonstrations to acquire power,"" he said."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - The outcome of the British election will help a fresh drive next week to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland after a near three-year hiatus, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Friday.
The British-run region's mandatory power-sharing executive, a key part of a 1998 peace deal that largely ended three decades of violence, collapsed in early 2017 after a row between the dominant Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein.
Both the DUP - hardline supporters of the union with Britain - and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein lost ground in the share of the vote in Thursday's election to what Coveney called ""middle ground"" parties more supportive of dialogue.
""We have seen a real surge in middle ground politics and I think that says a lot about the anxiety and impatience to get Stormont (Assembly) back up and functioning again,"" Coveney told Irish broadcaster RTE.
""I think we can make progress (in the negotiations) very quickly,"" said Coveney, who will co-chair the talks from Monday.
The middle ground surge cost the DUP two of the 10 seats it had won in 2017, while Sinn Fein just about retained its seven seats. A near 7% decline in its overall share of the vote marked the biggest decline for any party in the province.
Sinn Fein's decision to stand aside in three constituencies to boost better-placed opponents of the DUP only partly accounted for the reverse.
Both the DUP and Sinn Fein said frustration over repeated failed attempts to return to the devolved assembly had pushed voters to the more moderate pro-Irish SDLP and cross community Alliance Party, who won the last three seats on a much increased share of the vote.
If such a result were repeated in the multi-seat election for the devolved assembly - which London has said should take place if the talks do not succeed by mid-January - the SDLP and Alliance Party would greatly increase their presence in the regional parliament.
DEADLOCK
Sinn Fein has also long complained that attempts to break the deadlock in Belfast have been complicated by the DUP's role since 2017 in propping up the British government in London and the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland.
The resounding victory of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party in Thursday's election and the clear path it now opens up to end three years of Brexit uncertainty could remove those hurdles.
""Because of Boris Johnson's majority, the DUP are going to have now to refocus on the North, on relationships with ourselves and other parties and I think that assists us in the negotiations,"" Eoin O Broin, a senior Sinn Fein lawmaker in the Irish republic, told RTE.
""I'd been looking into next week actually much more encouraged than I might have been this time last year.""
In Thursday's election, Northern Ireland elected more Irish nationalists than unionists for the first time since Ireland was partitioned in 1921, and Sinn Fein renewed its calls for a vote to leave the UK and unite with the Irish Republic.
But Coveney said such talk of a united Ireland was ""not a helpful discussion right now""."

The deceased victim was believed to be a 78-year-old man who was renting the property where the cannisters were found, officials said at a press conference, though this could not be confirmed until the body had been retrieved.
Another victim had been taken to hospital with severe burn wounds. Several police had been treated for smoke inhalation.
""We were all confronted with a picture of devastation when we arrived,"" mayor Heiko Breithaupt told a news conference held in a nearby school, recounting his arrival shortly after the explosion at 9 local time (0855 GMT).
Police said that their earlier belief that war munitions had been found on the scene had not been borne out on closer inspection.
In an indication of the scale of the blast, one fireman told reporters that on rushing to the scene after the blast he found three people lying unconscious on the road outside.
The blast had torn through one section of the five-storey building, causing damage on both the street and courtyard sides. The 50 people living there would all need to be rehoused, Breithaupt said, adding that the building's structural stability was currently being checked.
Officials believed the gas cannisters, which may have been used to supplement the house's district heating, had caused the blast. Police were being assisted by specialist explosives teams.
The area around the property was sealed off and nearby residents were evacuated, including children at a local nursery. None of the children were hurt, police said.
Photos showed a communist-era residential block with smoke rising from blackened, twisted window-frames on the second floor.
Blankenburg is a city in the hilly Harz district, in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt."

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's finance minister deleted an Instagram post and issued an apology on Friday after criticism by a human rights group that embarrassed the new, women-led government days after it took office.
Katri Kulmuni, who became finance minister only this week, had posted an informal poll on whether the government should allow Finnish women with links to Islamic State to return from Syria, or just their children.
The poll asked her Instagram followers whether they backed repatriating ""children only"" or ""children and mothers"" from the al-Hol camp in a part of Syria held by Kurds. Kulmuni's Centre Party opposes letting the mothers return to Finland.
""Seriously, Finland? This is awful, if true,"" Andrew Stroehlein, the European media director of international watchdog Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. 
""A state should respect the rights of its citizens in all cases, not put life-and-death decisions about those citizens to a public referendum on social media. What's next, public hangings based on the volume of stadium cheers?"" 
Kulmuni, 32, said she had been expressing the views of the Centre Party which she leads, highlighting divisions on the issue with other parties in the five-party governing coalition.
""My aim to have a discussion on social media about a complicated topic failed. I apologize for the poll,"" Kulmuni tweeted on Friday. ""My IG (Instagram) poll aroused condemnation, it has been removed. The style was unsuccessful."" 
The criticism of the poll was all the more embarrassing as the new prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on Wednesday she would not alter her social media behavior but would be careful in what she posted.
Marin, a Social Democrat, said on Wednesday the government had given its ""silent blessing"" for the foreign ministry to go ahead with a plan to repatriate the children.
But the children cannot be repatriated without their mothers because the Syrian Kurdish forces oppose separating the children and their mothers, Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said. 
Finland is one of many EU countries trying to decide what to do about their citizens, with 11 Finnish women and more than 30 children held at al-Hol, and the government faces questioning in parliament on the issue on Tuesday. 
The Centre Party has been alarmed by the rise in polls of the nationalist Finns Party, which says repatriating Islamic State detainees could endanger Finland's security.

A fourth hostage, a Filipino, died from illness during captivity, European Products Carriers Ltd added.
It did not give details of the release.
The tanker, Elka Aristotle, was attacked on Nov. 4 about 18 km (11 miles) from the port of Lome. The pirates fled after kidnapping two Filipinos, one Greek and one Georgian.
The released men were safe and were ""being debriefed by the local authorities prior to returning home to the Philippines, Greece and Georgia respectively"", the company said.
A full investigation had been launched into the death of the Filipino.
""It is understood that his demise was not as a result of any actions by those holding the crew hostage but due to illness,"" European Products Carriers said in a statement.
While piracy has decreased worldwide, West Africa's Gulf of Guinea is a high-risk area for abductions and armed robbery.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police have earned an average of US$11,000 for each officer in overtime pay during the last six months of anti-government protests, with the total overtime bill coming to more than US$120 million, the government said on Friday.
Police have covered more than 900 protests since June and worked overtime only in ""inevitable circumstances"", the government's security bureau said in a written response to questions from pro-democracy lawmakers.
The Chinese-ruled city as been convulsed by almost daily and often violent protests since public opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill developed into demands for greater freedoms.
The security bureau said police overtime since the start of the turmoil has cost the government HK$950 million ($121 million). Some 11,000 police officers were paid overtime, which would mean an average of HK$86,363 per officer.
The protest have regularly featured ranks of riot police firing volleys of tear gas or baton-charging protesters, often in central business or tourist areas. They in turn have been targets of petrol bombs and other projectiles hurled by protesters, many of them masked.
There have been widespread allegations of police misconduct during the protests and public satisfaction with a force once held in great respect by the public has fallen to the lowest on record, according to a poll by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute.
Police have described their actions as reactive and restrained.
One pro-democracy lawmaker said that Hong Kong had become a ""police city"".
""Many citizens must question why they have to pay this bill for police officers. The whole society is shocked,"" Au Nok Hin told reporters.
A pro-Beijing lawmaker defended the overtime payments, saying police should be paid extra for extra work. China has said the police have shown restraint and that accusations of excessive force were false.
Protesters have called for an independent inquiry into the police force, making it one of their five demands on the Hong Kong government.
This week, five foreign experts said they had quit advising the police watchdog over doubts about its independence and ability to conduct an investigation into police conduct."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - When part of a seawall protecting Jakarta collapsed last week near fisherman Awing Takalar's shack it brought back bad memories of when another levee burst in 2007 and all his belongings were washed away.
Fortunately, the tides have not been high, and residents in the exposed section of the Indonesian capital's northern shoreline have not been affected yet. But Takalar knows his luck could run out.
""My worry is that the water is higher than the land,"" said Takalar, 46, who said he was concerned for the safety of his teenage daughter when she was alone in their one-roomed home in the poor Muara Baru area of Jakarta.
When the sea breached the levee 12 years ago, he took his family back to their home in Sulawesi.
""When it got better, I returned again,"" he said, adding that once his daughter has finished school he might leave the area for good.
Jarot Widyoko, director of rivers and coasts at Indonesia's public works and public housing ministry, said an investigation was underway into why a 170-metre stretch of the 2.3 km wall near Muara Baru was damaged. It was only built in the last few years.
The incident has thrown a spotlight on efforts to shore up parts of the low-lying city from being inundated in coming years. 
Jakarta is slowly sinking due to an over-extraction of ground water causing subsidence, with rising sea levels making the threat of flooding even worse and pushing the city to come up with elaborate programs to protect residents. 
In 2014, the government announced a plan to build a giant seawall along the coast as part of a $40 billion project to protect the city until 2030.
The planned seawall, which was part of what had been dubbed the ""Great Garuda"" for its resemblance to the wing span of the mythical bird, included a stalled plan to build a new city on a string of reclaimed islands in Jakarta bay.
The collapsed section is part of the first of three phases under the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development, which has come in for criticism from environmentalists concerned over the impact on the bay and for not fully addressing land subsidence. 
Heri Andreas, an expert on land subsidence at the Bandung Institute of Technology, said land in Muara Baru was sinking at a rate of 12 cm (4.7 inches) per year, one of the fastest in Jakarta.
Uncontrolled extraction of groundwater in Jakarta over the years has caused layers of rock and sediment to slowly pancake on top of each other.
The government announced in August it intends to move the administrative capital to East Kalimantan province, on Borneo island, to relieve Jakarta from ""a heavy burden"" due to overcrowding and pollution.
Saryad, 59, a street-side vendor, who has lived in the area for four decades, recalled how since he was a kid the sea had now become higher than the road in the area. 
But he admits he has few choices and will have to rely on the protection of the sea wall.

""My work is here, my home is here... Where else can I go anyway?""

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric on Friday condemned recent killings of anti-government protesters and urged full state control over the use of weapons in the country following one particular deadly attack by masked gunmen in Baghdad.
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani rarely weighs in on politics except in times of crisis but holds massive influence over public opinion in Shi'ite majority Iraq. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi pledged to quit last month hours after Sistani withdrew his support for the government.
Iraqi security forces have shot dead scores of demonstrators protesting against the government's failure to satisfy their demands for an overhaul of the country's political system, halting corruption and an end of deep-rooted Iranian influence over state institutions.
Sistani has addressed the unrest in every Friday sermon since the protests began on Oct. 1, calling on security forces to deal peacefully with demonstrators and also urging protesters to shun violence.
This week's comments followed an attack by heavily armed, masked gunmen who killed more than 20 people at Baghdad's main protest site. They roamed the streets for hours afterwards, threatening further violence.
""We strongly condemn the killings, kidnappings and assaults that took place in all forms,"" he said in a Friday sermon in the holy city of Kerbala, read out by his representative. 
""We call on all concerned parties to take responsibility,"" added Sistani, calling for an urgent investigation into the ""horrific crimes"".
Sistani said that all weapons should be brought ""under the control of the state"".
Paramilitary groups, including many backed by regional Shi'ite power Iran, make up a formal branch of Iraq's security forces, but some operate semi-independently. Many Iran-backed Iraqi militias have ties to powerful figures in Iraq's parliament and government. 
Sistani on Friday, the cleric warned against outside interference in Iraq, urging state security forces to be loyal to the nation.
""We must reiterate the necessity to build the army, and Iraq's other armed forces, on solid professional foundations, so that they are loyal to the homeland and can defend against external aggression,"" he said.
Sistani has long opposed foreign interference, as well as the Iranian model of senior clergy being closely involved in running state institutions.
Tens of thousands of protesters have been demanding an end to Iraq's post-2003 political system, underpinned by endemic political corruption. More than 440 people, mostly unarmed protesters but also some members of the security forces, have been killed since Oct. 1, according to a Reuters tally. 
Protesters blame Iran-backed militia groups for a spate of other killings including assassinations. Many activists have been arrested or have disappeared, local rights groups say.
Paramilitary groups have denied any role in attacking protests. Government security forces also deny using live ammunition against peaceful protesters.
As demonstrations enter their third month, violence is spiraling with an increase in threats, kidnappings and killings of activists and protesters, according to activists and security sources.
On Thursday, a young man was lynched in central Baghdad as dozens of onlookers recorded the incident on their phones, local media and rights activists reported. Reuters has been unable to verify the circumstances surrounding the incident, which was widely circulated on social media. 
Iraq's independent human rights commission blamed unidentified gangs and a lack of intervention by security forces.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Cases of the deadly Ebola virus have risen in the Democratic Republic of Congo where health care workers remain largely cut off from the disease's hotspots since militants attacked their camp, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.
Twenty-seven Ebola cases were confirmed in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the week through Dec. 10, against an average of seven in the last three weeks, WHO said.
Ebola is highly contagious and spreads through bodily fluids.
Militia fighters in eastern Congo killed four people and wounded several in attacks on two Ebola response centers two weeks ago, in what responders described as a serious setback to efforts to contain the epidemic.
""Insecurity is one of the main challenges that we are facing because it prevents us (from reaching) the communities to protect them against Ebola,"" Dr Michel Yao, WHO incident manager, told a Geneva briefing.
A helicopter is to be used as an air bridge to ferry epidemiologists and vaccinators to insecure areas and bring them back the same day, he said. More than 20 people from the stricken Biakato mine area were vaccinated on Thursday, he said.
""When we cannot access the community, we cannot perform surveillance activities including vaccination that has been one of the key innovations that help us really to stop the spread out of this country to others,"" Yao said.
There have been 3,340 Ebola cases including 2,210 deaths in the world's second largest epidemic that was declared in August 2018, WHO figures show.
An Ebola survivor fell ill with the disease for a second time in eastern Congo, the Congolese health authorities said on Sunday, saying it was not yet clear if it was a case of relapse or reinfection.
The man died in a village near Beni, Yao said.
WHO said that the majority of the 27 new cases were linked to a single chain of transmission, in which that man was a potential source of infection for 17 people.
It was the second time that Ebola virus had been documented in the man within six months, it said."

When Widodo was elected for his first term in 2014, the former furniture salesman and small town mayor seemed to offer a clean break from the military and political elite that had clung to power since the fall of strongman ruler Suharto in 1998.
Widodo, who recently started a second term, was questioned by reporters about his eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, following in his footsteps by registering to run for mayor of Solo on Java island and his son-in-law, Bobby Nasution, running for mayor in the city of Medan in Sumatra.
""That's a competition. You can win, or lose in competitions, it's up to the people with the right to choose,"" Widodo said on Thursday in televised comments posted on the Twitter feed of the tvOne news channel.
His son has the backing of Widodo's party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), but the president said it was purely Raka's decision to run for mayor.
Family ties often run deep in Indonesian politics. The family of the country's founding father and first president, Sukarno, have remained a major force in politics.
Sukarno's daughter, Megawati Sukarnoputri, was Indonesia's fifth president and currently chairs PDI-P. Sukarnoputri's daughter, Puan Maharani, is speaker of parliament.
Aria Bima, a PDI-P politician, told Reuters that he did not see any issues with Widodo's family members running for office.
""As long as there's personal, professional and social competence with the right ideology, that's not oligarchy,"" he said.
Widodo became Solo’s first directly elected mayor in 2005 and was hugely popular after cleaning up the streets and public spaces with incentives and persuasion to shift thousands of illegal vendors to new facilities.
Titi Anggraini, executive director of the Association for Elections and Democracy, a electoral watchdog, said the entry of his family into politics risked tarnishing Widodo's reputation.
""Despite having no practical experience in politics or being trained properly in political parties, Raka and Nasution's bid is a sign of Widodo's family wanting to preserve its power,"" she said."

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi was due to leave the Netherlands on Friday after defending her country against accusations of genocide during three days of hearings at the International Court of Justice.
WHERE DO THE PROCEEDINGS STAND NOW?
The west African country of Gambia filed a case in November, alleging Myanmar was committing ""an ongoing genocide"" against its minority Muslim Rohingya population.
As a first step, Gambia asked the court to order emergency measures to protect the Rohingya and keep the conflict from getting worse.
These are meant as a kind of restraining order while the 17-judge panel looks at the full case on its merits, which usually takes several years to complete.
The court said it would rule on the request as soon as possible, but did not set a specific date. A ruling is expected within weeks.
These hearings are expected to have been the first in a long process. The genocide case against Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica in 1995 took almost 15 years to complete.
If the court finds in its rulings on provisional measures it has the jurisdiction, the case will move forward at the ornate Peace Palace in The Hague - even if the judges decide against emergency measures.
Myanmar would then get another chance to argue the court has no legal grounds to look at Gambia's claim and to file a so-called preliminary objection - which can only touch on issues of jurisdiction.
If the court rejects that objection, the judges could finally look at the case in another round of public hearings.
It is not unusual for several years to pass between the initial claim and the actual hearing of the case on its merits.
WHAT IS GAMBIA'S CASE?
Gambia says that as a signatory to the 1948 Genocide Convention it has the obligation to prevent and punish genocide, no matter where it takes place.
In court, it relied heavily on U.N. reports of killings, mass rapes and widespread arson on Rohingya villages, carried out with what the researchers called ""genocidal intent"".
The protective measures it demands include ordering Myanmar to preserve evidence of alleged atrocities and to allow access to U.N. investigators.
HOW HAS MYANMAR RESPONDED?
Suu Kyi acknowledged there may have been some war crimes or crimes against humanity, but insisted none of these rose to the level of genocide - for which the specific intent to destroy a group has to be proven.
She also repeated Myanmar's official line that the crackdown on the Rohingya was a legitimate military operation, not aimed at civilians but at armed Muslim militants in Rakhine state.
A lawyer for Myanmar also told judges there were simply not enough deaths to amount to genocide.
Suu Kyi called on the judges to dismiss the accusation and said her country's own justice system should be given the chance to work first."

Qaboos did not attend an annual Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, where the country's delegation was led by the deputy prime minister.
Qaboos has no children and has not publicly appointed a successor, but he secretly recorded his choice in a sealed envelope addressed to the royal family council.
The sultanate's Basic Law says the royal family should choose a new sultan within three days of the position falling vacant.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fiona's rebellion against the People's Republic of China began slowly in the summer months, spreading across her 16-year-old life like a fever dream. The marches and protests, the standoffs with police, the lies to her parents. They'd all built on top of her old existence until she found herself, now, dressed in black, her face wrapped with a homemade balaclava that left only her eyes and a pale strip of skin visible. Her small hands were stained red.
It was just paint, she said, as she funneled liquid into balloons. The air around her stank of lighter fluid. Teenagers hurled Molotov cocktails toward police. Lines of archers roamed the grounds of the university they'd seized; now and then, they stopped to release metal-tipped arrows into the darkness, let fly with the hopes of finding the flesh of a cop.
Down below Fiona, rows of police flanked an intersection. Within a stone's throw, Chinese soldiers stood in riot gear behind the gates of an outpost of the People's Liberation Army, one of the most powerful militaries on the planet.
Fiona joined her first march on June 9, a schoolgirl making her way to the city's financial district on a sunny day as people called out for freedom. It was now November 16, and she was one of more than 1,000 protesters swarming around and barricaded inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Because of their young age and the danger of arrest, Reuters is withholding the full names of Fiona and her comrades.
Night was falling. They were wild and free with their violence, but on the verge of being surrounded and pinned down.
The kids, which is what most of them were, buzzed back and forth like hornets, cleaning glass bottles at one station, filling them with lighter fluid and oil in another. An empty swimming pool was commandeered to practice flinging the Molotov cocktails, leaving burn marks skidded everywhere.
When front-line decisions needed to be made, clumps of protesters came together to form a jittering black nest – almost everyone was dressed from hood to mask to pants in black – yelling about whether to charge or pull back.
They were becoming something different from what they were, a metamorphosis that would have been difficult to imagine in orderly Hong Kong, a city where you line up neatly for an elevator door and crowds don't step into an empty street until the signal changes. With each slap up against the police, each scramble down the subway stairs to avoid arrest as tear gas ate at their eyes, they hardened. They shifted back and forth between their old lives and their new – school uniforms and dinners with mom and dad, then pulling the masks over their faces once more. It was a dangerous balance.
""We may all be killed by the police. Yes,"" said Fiona.
At the crucible of Polytechnic University, Fiona and the others crossed a line. Their movement has embraced the slogan of ""be water,"" of pushing forward with dramatic action and then pulling back suddenly, but here, the protesters hunkered down, holding a large chunk of territory in the middle of Hong Kong. In their hive of enraged adolescence, they were risking everything for a tomorrow that almost certainly won't come – a Hong Kong that cleaves greater freedom from an increasingly powerful Chinese Communist Party.
In doing so, Fiona found moments bigger than what her life was before. ""We call the experience of protest, like at PolyU, a dream,"" she later explained.
But to speak of such things out loud, without the mask that she hid behind, without the throbbing crowds that made it seem within reach, is not possible outside, in the real Hong Kong.
The protesters have left traces of their hopes, confessions and fears across the city, in graffiti scrawled on bank buildings and bus stops alike. One line that's appeared: ""There may be no winners in this revolution but please stay to bear witness.""
GLOBAL REVERBERATIONS
The impact of Hong Kong's protests, as they pass the half-year mark, is this: Kids with rocks and bottles have fought their way to the sharp edge between two nation states expected to shape the 21st century.
The street unrest resembles an ongoing brawl between police and the young men and women in black. Police have fired about 16,000 rounds of tear gas and 10,000 rubber bullets. Since June, they've rounded up people from the ages of 11 to 84, making more than 6,000 arrests. About 500 officers have been wounded in the melee.
Hong Kong's police officials have said all along that their operations are guided by a desire to maintain public order, rejecting accusations they use excessive force. They issued a plea as recently as Thursday, saying, ""If rioters don't use violence, Hong Kong will be safe and there's no reason for us to use force.""
After the U.S. Congress was galvanized by the plight of the protesters, it passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which President Donald Trump signed last month. The law subjects Hong Kong to review by the U.S. State Department, at least once a year, on whether the city has clung to enough autonomy from Beijing to continue receiving favorable trading terms from America. It also provides for sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, against officials responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong.
The protesters were delighted, carrying American flags and singing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" in the streets of Hong Kong. Beijing was furious. China has had sovereignty over Hong Kong since the British handed it over in 1997. The Chinese government quickly banned U.S. military ships from docking in Hong Kong, a traditional port of call in the region.
The protesters, including many as young as Fiona, had changed the course of aircraft carriers and guided-missile destroyers.
Chinese state media describe the unrest as the work of ""rioters"" and ""radicals,"" accusing foreign governments of fanning anti-China sentiment in the city. Beijing's top diplomat has demanded that Washington ""stop interfering in China's internal affairs.""
The stakes for the kids of Hong Kong go well beyond a moment of geopolitical standoff. When Britain passed the city to China, like a pearl slipping from the hand of one merchant to another, there was a written understanding that for 50 years Hong Kong would enjoy a great deal of autonomy. Known as ""one country, two systems,"" the agreement suspended some of the blow of a global finance center coming under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The deal expires in 2047. For Fiona, this means that in her lifetime she will live not in the freewheeling city to which she was born, but, quite possibly, in a place that's just another dot on the map of China.
Chants at marches revolve around five protester demands, such as universal suffrage, with ""Not one less!"" the automatic refrain. But conversations soon turn to a larger, more difficult topic at the root of their complaints. China.
During interviews with more than a dozen protesters at Polytechnic and another university besieged at the same time, and continued contact with many of them in the weeks that followed, the subject sprang up repeatedly. It's never far, they said, the shadow of Beijing over the Hong Kong government's policies.
""They're all involved with this shit,"" said Lee, who gave only her last name. The 20-year-old nursing student covered her mouth after the obscenity, embarrassed to have said it out loud in the middle of a cafe, and quickly continued. ""Of course China is the big boss behind this.""
""If China is going to take over Hong Kong, we will lose our freedoms, we will lose our rights as humans,"" she said. Police had taken down her information when she surrendered outside Polytechnic University. She didn't yet know whether that would lead to an arrest on rioting charges, which could bring up to 10 years of prison.
""In my view, violence is the thing that protects us,"" Lee said. ""It is a warning to those, like the police, who think they can do anything to us.""
The acceptance of violence isn't limited to the barricades. Joshua Wong, the global face of the movement's lobbying efforts, said he understood the need for protesters ""to defend themselves with force.""
As Wong spoke during an interview in Hong Kong on Wednesday, the headline on the front page of the South China Morning Post on the table next to his elbow read: ""BOMB PLOTTERS 'INTENDED TO TARGET POLICE AT MASS RALLY'""
If a group of protesters had indeed planned to bomb police, would that have been a step too far?
""I think the fundamental issue,"" he said, ""is we never can prove which strategy is the most effective or not-effective way to put pressure on Beijing.""
AN AWAKENING
When Fiona first heard about a bill that would allow criminal suspects to be shipped from Hong Kong to mainland China, the initial trigger of the protests, she wasn't concerned. It was the sort of thing that troublemakers worried about. ""The extradition bill seemed good to me,"" she said.
Her mother, a housewife from mainland China, is the product of a Communist education system that, as Fiona puts it, doesn't ""allow them to think about politics."" She is still unaware, for example, that there was a massacre around Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in 1989.
Fiona's father, from Hong Kong, drives a minibus taxi. He has concerns about creeping mainland control, but his urge to ""treasure our freedom"" leaves him afraid of anything that might provoke Beijing's wrath: ""He keeps saying we should not do this and we should not do that.""
They live together in a sliver of a working-class district in Kowloon, the peninsula that juts above Hong Kong island. It is a place of tiny apartments and people just trying to get by.
It was much better, everyone in her household agreed, to avoid politics.
On weekends, Fiona, who has a cartoon sticker of Cinderella on the back of her iPhone, usually went shopping with girlfriends from high school. They looked for new outfits. They chatted and had tea together.
But when Fiona saw the news that more than 3,000 Hong Kong lawyers dressed in black had marched against the proposed extradition bill on June 6, she wondered what was going on.
She clicked through YouTube on her cell phone. She stopped on a Cantonese-language video uploaded less than a week before by a young, handsome guy – hair cropped close on the sides and in a sort of thick flop on top – sitting on the edge of a bed. The video was speeded up so the presenter spoke in a fast blur, delivering on what he billed as, ""Extradition bill 6 minute summary for dummies.""
The idea of the bill, on its face, wasn't a problem, the young man said – public safety and rules are important. The issue was that the judiciary in the mainland and the judiciary in Hong Kong are two totally different things.
The Chinese Communist Party, he said, might use this new linkage between the court systems to come after ordinary people who were exercising their freedom of speech, something protected in Hong Kong but not Beijing: ""You may be extradited to China because of telling a joke.""
Fiona was alarmed.
Just a few days after her YouTube awakening, on June 9, she took the subway with a group of friends from high school over to Hong Kong island. The crowd filled the march's meeting point, Victoria Park, and soon flooded outside its boundaries. Between the glimmering towers of commerce, they yelled: ""Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!"" They yelled: ""No China extradition! No evil law!"" Fiona was astonished. She couldn't believe so many people had shown up.
The swell of the crowd, the boom and crash of its noise, was adrenaline and inspiration – ""all of us were having the same aim,"" Fiona said.
The city's leader, Beijing-backed Carrie Lam, would have to relent, Fiona thought. Faced with the will of so many citizens – a million came out that day, in a city of about 7.5 million – Lam had no choice but to meet with protesters and address their concerns.
That's not what happened.
Three days later, the Hong Kong police shot rubber bullets and tear gas into a crowd.
On July 1, protesters wearing yellow construction hats and gauze masks stormed into the city's Legislative Council building on the 22nd anniversary of the handover from the British. They smashed through glass doors with hammers, poles and road barriers, spray-painting the walls as the chaos churned – ""HONG KONG IS NOT CHINA.""
A PREDICTION OF MORE VIOLENCE
On the night of November 16, as Fiona sat on the terrace at Polytechnic, a teenager slouched at his post on a pedestrian bridge on the other side of the school. Reaching across a highway between the back of the university and a subway stop, the bridge could be a point of entry for police, the protesters feared.
The road underneath the bridge led to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, a main artery linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon Peninsula. The protesters had blocked that route, hoping to trigger a citywide strike. It was becoming clear that would not happen.
The teenager on the bridge, whose full name includes Pak and who sometimes goes by Paco, had the sleeves of his black Adidas (DE:ADSGN) windbreaker rolled up his arms. His glasses jutted out of the eye-opening of his ski mask. The 17-year-old, thick-set and volatile, recently had gotten kicked out of his house after arguing with his parents about the protests. They’re both from mainland China, Pak explained. ""They always say, 'Kill the protesters; the government is right.'""
There was a divide between him and his parents that couldn't be crossed, he said. As a student in Hong Kong, he received a relatively liberal education at school, complete with the underpinnings of Western philosophical and political thought.
""I was born in Hong Kong. I know what is freedom. I know what is democracy. I know what is freedom of speech,"" Pak said, his voice rising with each sentence.
His parents, on the other hand, were educated and raised on the mainland. His shorthand for what that meant: ""You know, we should love the Party, we should love Mao Zedong, blah, blah, blah.""
In his downtime, Pak hunched over an empty green Jolly Shandy Lemon bottle and poured lighter fluid inside. He gestured to containers of cooking and peanut oil and said he added them as well because they helped the fire both burn and stick once the glass exploded.
He couldn't count how many he'd filled in the past two days at Polytechnic. Pak was working a shift as a lookout on the bridge. He guzzled soda and coffee to stay awake, lifting his mask to slurp, revealing a round chin and an adolescent's light dusting of hair on his upper lip. There was a mattress on the floor around the corner for quick naps. On a board leaning against the side of the walkway in front of him, a message was scrawled in capital letters: EYES OPEN!
Where did he think it was all headed? Pak put the bottle down and said he saw nothing but struggle ahead. ""I think the violence of the protests will be increased; it will be upgraded,"" he said. ""But we have no choice.""
When Pak was 12 years old, he watched news coverage of a massive, peaceful protest in Hong Kong, the 2014 ""Umbrella Revolution,"" a sit-in that called for universal suffrage. The movement ended with protesters being hit by tear gas and hauled off to jail.
The nonviolent tactics, Pak said, got them nowhere.
Did he worry that the violence was taking place so near to a People's Liberation Army barracks?
Not at all. That morning, a separate barracks in Hong Kong was in the news when some of its soldiers, in exercise shorts and T-shirts, walked out to the road carrying red buckets and helped clean up debris left by protesters near the city's Baptist University. The event made both local and international headlines for the rarity of PLA soldiers' appearance in public. Under the city's mini-constitution, the Chinese military can be called by the Hong Kong government to help maintain public order, but they ""shall not interfere"" in local affairs.
""I think they are testing us. If we attack the PLA, the PLA can shoot us and say, 'OK, we were defending ourselves,'"" Pak said. ""If we don't attack the PLA, they will cross the line, again and again.""
But, he said, if the protesters continued ramping up violence against the cops, maybe the PLA would be called in. And that, he said, would hand the protest movement victory.
""Other countries like (the) British and America can protect human rights in Hong Kong by sending troops to protect us,"" he said. It was, under any reading of the situation, a far-fetched idea. Hong Kong is by international law the domain of Beijing; the Chinese Communist Party can send in troops to clamp down on civil unrest. There's not been a hint of any Western power being interested in intervening on the ground.
Pak was right about one thing, though. Police officers later massed on the other side of the bridge, piling out of their vehicles and walking in a long file to the head of the structure. The protesters lit the bridge ablaze. People screamed. Flames leapt. A funnel of black smoke filled the air.
The next night, Pak didn't reply to notes sent by Telegram, the encrypted messaging app he used. A day later, he still didn't answer notes asking where he was. The day after that, the same. Pak was gone.
""I HAVE TO BECOME TWO PEOPLE""
The young man lay his hands down on the table. They were bandaged and his fingers curved over in an unnatural crook. He'd not been out of his family's house much in two weeks. Tommy, 19, shredded his hands on a rope when he squeezed it hard as his body whooshed down off a bridge on the side of Polytechnic University.
They were better now, his fingers. A photograph he sent just after, on November 20, showed a deep pocket of flesh ripped from his left pinkie, close to the bone by the look of it, and skin shredded across both hands. ""I didn't wear gloves,"" he explained.
After hitting the ground, he'd rushed to a line of waiting vehicles, driven by ""parents"" – protester slang for volunteers who show up to whisk them away from dangerous situations.
On the morning of November 18, while still inside Polytechnic, he had sent a note saying his actual parents knew he was there and he couldn't find a way out.
""Worst case might be the police coming in polyu arresting all the people inside and beat them up,"" he said in a note on Telegram, the chat platform. ""I'm like holy shit and i gotta be safe and not arrested.""
That evening, he was still there. He didn't see a way to escape. Tommy went to the ""front line"" to face off with the police, not far from the ledge where Fiona sat a couple nights before. Tommy carried a makeshift shield, a piece of wood and then part of a plastic road barrier, to protect himself from the blasts of a water cannon. He didn't make it very far.
Unlike most of the protesters who were around him, Tommy is a student at Polytechnic. He has worked hard to get there.
He's a kid from a far-flung village up toward the border with the mainland, where both of his parents are from. Everyone in his village opposes the protests, he said, and there are ""triads"" in the area, members of organized-crime groups that are seen as sometimes doing Beijing's bidding.
Was he sorry that he'd put himself in danger?
""No regrets,"" came the first text message response, at 7:29 p.m., even as police continued to mass outside Polytechnic and fears grew of a violent storming of the campus.
""They are wrong""
""We're doing the right thing""
""It's so unforgettable and good""
Hours later, he went down the rope.
Now, meeting to talk after a visit to a clinic for his hands, Tommy said he wasn't sure what would come next for his city. Or himself. Although the university was still closed, he'd been keeping up with his studies, emailing professors and working on a paper about Hong Kong's solid-waste treatment policy. Unable to go to the gym because of the hand injury – his athletic frame sheathed in an Adidas jogging suit – Tommy had been feeling restless.
It was obvious the troubles would continue, he said. ""Carrie Lam will not accept the demands, the protesters will keep going, people will keep getting arrested,"" he said. ""The government wants to arrest all the people.""
But the future would still arrive and he had his own dreams: of a wife and a family, and being a man who provided for them. Tommy said he'd been thinking of applying for a government job after graduation. They're steady and have good benefits.
He would also remain a part of the protest movement.
How could he manage both?
Tommy paused a moment before answering. Then, he said:
""I have to become two people.""
AN ARREST, AND READING UP ON LENIN
On the afternoon of December 1, life was sunshine and breeze at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. Inside, a youth orchestra was scheduled to play its annual concert, billed as ""collaging Chinese music treasures from various soundscapes of China."" Out front, facing the water, a band played cover songs – belting out the lyrics to Bon Jovi's ""You Give Love a Bad Name."" Couples strolled on the boardwalk. The palms swayed. A shop sold ice cream.
And there was Pak, sitting on a bench. He'd been arrested trying to flee Polytechnic in the early morning hours of November 19. After a day spent in a police station, he made bail and moved back in with his parents.
Out in the open, in blue sweatpants and a grey sweatshirt, he was a pudgy teenager with the awkward habit of pushing his eyeglasses up the bridge of his nose as he spoke. He had a couple pimples above his left eye. Also, he was now facing a rioting charge, and had to report back to the police station in a few weeks.
Since his disappearance, the siege at Polytechnic had ended. The protesters simmered down. There was an election for local district councillors, and pro-democracy candidates won nearly 90% of 452 seats.
But two weeks after his arrest, Pak had shown up ready to protest again. A march was slated to start in a couple hours. He'd taken a bus down from one of Hong Kong's poorest districts, with a black backpack that held his dark clothes and mask.
The lesson of the elections, he said, was that most Hong Kong citizens not only back the protests but ""accept the violence level."" Otherwise, he said, they would have rebuked the reform ticket and cast their lot with pro-government candidates.
""I think,"" he said, ""the violence of the protesters needs to upgrade to setting off bombs.""
He'd been reading about the Russian Revolution and Vladimir Lenin. If he saw irony in studying the architect of the Soviet communist dictatorship while contemplating his own fight against the world's preeminent Communist Party, he didn't say so.
""The protesters, I think, will need some weapons, like rifles,"" he said.
If it wasn't possible to buy them, he said, it seemed easy enough to ransack police cars or even stations to steal them. He described how that could be done.
The protests that day veered back to confrontation. A black flag with the words ""HONG KONG INDEPENDENCE"" flapped above the crowd. The scene to the north, in Kowloon, ""descended into chaos as rioters hijacked public order events and resorted to destructive acts like building barricades on roads, setting fires and vandalizing public facilities,"" according to a police account. Any hopes that the elections might bring peace seemed fragile. December was off to a turbulent start.
NO CHOICE BUT TO KEEP FIGHTING
In the weeks after walking out of Polytechnic University, slipping past the police, Fiona kept coming back to the heat of the protests. An assembly to support those who protested at Polytechnic. A rally to stop the use of tear gas, which featured little children carrying yellow balloons and a march past the city's Legislative Council building.
And on a Saturday afternoon, the last day of November, a gathering of students and the elderly at the city's Chater Garden. The park sits among thick trappings of wealth and power – the private Hong Kong Club, rows of bank buildings and, just down the street, luxury laced across the store windows of Chanel and Cartier. Fiona was with a friend toward the back, on the top of a wall, out of sight of the TV cameras. Her face was hidden behind a mask, as usual. Even between protesters, they usually pass nicknames and nods, with nothing that identifies them in daily life.
Her friend, a boy who goes to the same high school, held forth on revolution and the perils of greater mainland China influence in Hong Kong. Fiona listened, quietly. She nodded her head. She looked out at the crowd. It felt good to see that she was not alone, Fiona said. Though, she said, it was hard to tell where the movement was headed.
It could grind into the sort of underground movement that Tommy hinted at. It could erupt in the boom of Pak's bloody fantasy.
For Fiona, she knew there was always the danger that police might track down her earlier presence at Polytechnic, ending her precarious dance between homework and street unrest.
But sitting there, as the chants echoed and the sun began to slide down the sky over Hong Kong, Fiona said there was no choice but to keep fighting.
A week later, on Dec. 8, Fiona was at Victoria Park, almost six months to the day since her first protest started there. Hundreds of thousands of people had come for the march. It took Fiona an hour just to get out of the park as the throngs slowly squeezed onto the road outside.
When they saw messages on their cellphones that police had massed down one side street, Fiona and three friends threw on their respirator masks and goggles. As they jogged in that direction, a stranger in the crowd handed them an umbrella; another stranger gave them bottles of water. They joined a group of others, clutching umbrellas and advancing toward police lines, then coming to a halt.
No tear gas or rubber bullets came. The police looked to have taken a step back.
Fiona and her friends dawdled, unsure of what to do. They joined the march, a great mass of people churning through Hong Kong, at one point holding cell phones aloft, an ocean of bobbing lights. They screamed obscenities at police when they saw them, with Fiona showing a middle finger and calling for their families to die. They watched a man throw a hammer at the Bank of China building and heard the crash of breaking glass.

Someone pulled out a can of black spray paint. In the middle of the road, Fiona and her friends took turns writing on the pavement. They left a message: ""If we burn, you burn with us!""

Arrest warrants have been issued for Dahlan on accusations of playing a role in the 2016 attempted coup in Turkey, seeking to change the constitutional order by force, and various spying-related charges, the ministry said in a statement. Dahlan has also recently been an outspoken critic of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
Turkey accuses the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen and his followers of carrying out the failed putsch of July 2016, when rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, tanks and helicopters in a bid to seize power in which some 250 people were killed.
Dahlan has lived in the United Arab Emirates since he was driven out of the Palestinian territories in 2011 after a row with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
He was formerly an elected member of Abbas' Fatah party central committee, and was a fierce foe of Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the Gaza Strip and that has forged close ties with Turkey.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa holds an emergency cabinet meeting on Friday to try and resolve a power crisis that has dented growth in Africa's most industrialized economy and endangers its last investment-grade credit rating.
Struggling state utility Eskom implemented the most extensive power cuts in more than a decade earlier this week, disrupting supply to businesses and households. It said it would reduce power for a ninth straight day on Friday.
Eskom is choking under a massive 450 billion rand ($30.6 billion) debt burden and struggles to meet electricity demand because its creaking coal-fired power stations haven't been maintained properly.
The power crisis is one of the biggest challenges for Ramaphosa, a former trade union leader turned millionaire businessman who has promised to fix ailing state firms and reverse years of mismanagement and stagnation.
But he has found it hard to overhaul Eskom and lift the country's growth rate due to entrenched opposition to his reforms. Another struggling state firm, South African Airways, entered a form of bankruptcy protection last week.
Ramaphosa said on Wednesday that Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan would present proposals on solving the power crisis to cabinet on Friday, after the outages forced some miners to temporarily cut output early this week.
EASE REGULATIONS
Some of those proposals include fast-tracking applications of businesses seeking to generate their own electricity, bringing in temporary generators and connecting renewable energy projects to the grid sooner than initially planned.
Private firms have been clamoring for years for the government to ease regulations to allow them to generate more of their own electricity.
Roger Baxter (NYSE:BAX), chief executive of industry group the Minerals Council, told Reuters that miners could bring online between 500 MW and 1,500 MW of their own generating capacity over the next few years, if regulations were eased.
""All our eggs are in one basket with Eskom, which is not delivering. Government and business need to work together to solve this problem,"" Baxter said.
Eskom, which said it would cut 2,000 MW of power from the national grid on Friday, has said the country needs an additional 5,000 MW of capacity for it to have a large enough safety margin to do proper maintenance on its plants.
As of Friday, Eskom had almost 12,000 MW of unplanned breakdowns, versus its nominal capacity of around 44,000 MW.
Power cuts are expected to ease from the middle of next week, as many local businesses shut down before the Christmas and New Year public holidays.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 06:45AM ET</span>",Ex-premier elected Algerian president; thousands prepare to march,"By Lamine Chikhi and Hamid Ould Ahmed
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune was elected Algeria's new president after a vote the authorities hope will end months of turmoil, but demonstrators who toppled his predecessor Abdelaziz Bouteflika vowed that their movement would not stop.
Tebboune, who served as housing minister under Bouteflika and briefly as premier before falling out with tycoons in the ex-leader's entourage, was announced on Friday as the winner of more than half the vote, making a second round unnecessary.
Authorities said 40% of voters had taken part in Thursday's election, which state media cast as a high enough turnout to vindicate the decision to hold the poll in spite of a boycott.
But protesters saw the contest between five officially sanctioned candidates as an illegitimate sham intended to keep the old ruling elite in place. Thousands of demonstrators were expected to take to the streets to protest against the result. 
The authorities, including the powerful army, argue that the only way to move the country forward after demonstrators brought an end to Bouteflika's 20-year-rule in April is to elect a successor.
Weekly protests that toppled Bouteflika have not stopped, with demonstrators demanding the entire ruling elite cede power to a new generation, despite no obvious leader emerging to represent them. The protesters refer to themselves simply as ""Hirak"", or ""the movement"".
Tebboune's rivals included another former premier, two former ministers and a former member of the ruling party's central committee.
Protesters marched in cities and towns across Algeria throughout Thursday's election, in some places clashing with police, who tried to disperse them with baton charges. 
Late on Thursday, the election body said some 9 million Algerians took part in the election. 
""The turnout is satisfying and it will give the new president enough backing to implement his reforms,"" said Ahmed Mizab, a commentator on state television, saying it showed the decision to hold the elections was ""propitious and right"". 
But Riad Mekersi, 24, who has participated in all the Hirak protests since Feb. 22 in Algiers, said the movement will continue no matter who wins.
""We have toppled Bouteflika, and we will topple all the system's men. We won't give up,"" he said. 
Even without questions over his legitimacy, Tebboune will face difficult times. 

Nearly all Algerian state revenues come from oil and gas exports, which have declined in both price and volume in recent years. The government has already approved a 2020 budget with a 9% cut in public spending, though politically sensitive subsidies remain untouched.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Protesters angry over American demands that South Korea pay more for defense destroyed portraits of the U.S. ambassador stuck on blocks of tofu outside the U.S. embassy on Friday after police warned them against staging a more aggressive demonstration.
U.S. Ambassador Harry Harris has become a political lightning rod for South Koreans angered by U.S. President Donald Trump's push to get South Korea to pay billions of dollars more toward maintaining the 28,500 American troops stationed there.
""Harris out! We are not a U.S. colony! We are not an ATM machine!"" the demonstrators chanted outside the embassy, surrounded by phalanxes of police.
The left-leaning protesters from several youth groups cheered as two students smashed up blocks of tofu and acorn jelly adorned with paper portraits of Harris.
Longtime allies, the United States and South Korea are in dispute over how much each should pay for the U.S. troops in South Korea. Trump has demanded Seoul pay as much as $4 billion more a year, according to South Korean officials, and a new round of talks is scheduled in Seoul next week.
South Korea currently contributes about $900 million to the upkeep of U.S. troops in the country.
""How is it possible for a tenant to ask for five-fold increase in rent from its landlord?"" Kwon Oh-min, a Youth Party representative, said outside the U.S. embassy on Friday.
South Korea has the third-largest presence of U.S. troops based overseas after Japan and German. Major bases include the U.S. Army Garrison Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, which covers 14.7 million square meters.
In October, dozens of progressive university students climbed into the grounds of the ambassador's residence in protest against the U.S. presence in the country, sparking calls from the embassy for more police protection.
Another gathering of progressive groups is planned for Saturday outside the U.S. embassy to urge Washington to withdraw its request for defense cost-sharing increases ahead of the next round of the Special Measures Agreement (SMA) talks next week.
Seoul police told Reuters they had warned Friday's protesters not to bring hazardous materials or propaganda that could be construed as defamatory or insulting and that they planned to ""restrict the protests if they cross the line"".
The groups had initially planned to behead an effigy of Harris but scaled back their demonstration to smashing up the blocks of traditional Korean food after the police warning.
Across the street from the U.S. embassy, a rival gathering of conservative, pro-Washington protesters hit people wearing the masks of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in with toy hammers."

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's ex-premier Ahmet Davutoglu took aim at his former boss Tayyip Erdogan on Friday, saying the country was being held back by a concentration of power, economic crisis and an atmosphere of fear as he called for an overhaul of the political system.
""Those ruling Turkey have no agenda other than staying in power,"" Davutoglu said as he announced his new party, which could further erode support for Erdogan after his ruling AKP suffered election setbacks in local elections earlier this year.
A day after applying to establish the breakaway Future Party, Davutoglu said Turkey's judiciary had turned into a mechanism ""feared rather than trusted"" and that its economy was in ""deep crisis"".
Davutoglu, 60, announced his resignation from the Islamist-rooted AKP in September, saying the party which has dominated Turkish politics for 17 years was no longer able to solve the country's problems and was stifling internal debate.
""Despite all the pressure and the atmosphere of fear which they have tried to create...we have come together to set out a democratic and prosperous future for our country,"" he said.
Davutoglu served as prime minister from 2014 to 2016, before falling out with the president and being replaced by another Erdogan loyalist as Turkey moved to a presidential system.
Without naming Erdogan, he sharply criticized the concentration of power around a leader who has ruled Turkey since early 2003, first as prime minister and then as president.
""The presidential system was constructed with the thought of transferring as much power as possible to the executive and increasing influence over the legislative and judiciary,"" he said.
He said it was essential to fight corruption and guarantee the separation of powers, adding that efforts to control the judiciary must be seen as ""the greatest of crimes"".
""We defend a democratic parliamentary system,"" he added, calling for a new constitution.
Davutoglu resigned two months after former deputy prime minister Ali Babacan also left the AKP, citing deep differences. Babacan will announce his own rival political party within weeks, a source close to him said.
Polls show support for the new parties and their leaders in single percentage point figures, meaning they could pose little challenge to Erdogan and the AKP on their own.
However, after defeat in mayoral elections in Ankara and Istanbul this year, and with economic difficulties eroding his voter base, any loss of support could hit efforts to extend Erdogan's rule. Elections are not scheduled until 2023."

HINDU NAGAR, India (Reuters) - When the young woman limped toward shopkeeper Ravindra Prakash, pleading for help on a dark and foggy morning in the northern Indian village, her body was so charred that he thought she was a witch. He grabbed a wooden stick and tried to shoo her away.
As she came closer, under the dim light of his shop, it took Prakash a few minutes to realize she was from his village, Hindu Nagar, in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh.
He called the police. In a shaky voice, the 23-year-old woman narrated her ordeal to an official on the other line. She said she had been beaten and set ablaze in nearby fields by five men from her village - including two she had accused of having raped her last year.
That morning of Dec. 5, the woman had set out early to catch a train that was due to depart around 5 am to meet her lawyer to pursue her rape case, according to her statement in a police report. After she was burnt, the government ordered her moved to a hospital in New Delhi, where she succumbed to her injuries late on Dec. 6.
While her death has sparked nationwide outrage, her village stands divided over it, largely over caste lines.
The woman belonged to a lower caste of blacksmiths. The five men accused of her murder are from Hindu Nagar's dominant landowning caste. Many upper-caste villagers defended the men and questioned the woman's character, some dismissing her death as a love affair gone wrong. Others accused her of falsely trying to implicate the men, whose families insisted on their innocence.
""She had big plans for herself,"" said her father, who makes chisels, shovels and other farm tools on a road outside the village. Sitting with his head bowed on a chair outside his mud home, as villagers gathered around to watch, he said: ""I want justice for my daughter. I want her killers hanged.""
Reuters is withholding the name of the woman and her family members because India's Supreme Court bars revealing the identity of sexual assault victims, including through their families.
The divisions in Hindu Nagar, a village of roughly 2,000 people surrounded partly by yellow mustard fields, illustrate India's challenge in addressing a rape problem that women's rights groups say is common across the country, particularly in rural areas. A rape occurs every 20 minutes, on average, in the country of 1.3 billion people, according to federal data.
The brutal gang rape and murder of a young physiotherapist on a Delhi bus in 2012 provoked such widespread revulsion that India enacted some of the world's toughest anti-rape laws, including the death penalty in some cases.
But it has had little impact, women's rights experts say. Cases are reported, but government data shows that conviction rates are low. 
In another attack this month, a 27-year-old veterinarian was raped and murdered near the southern city of Hyderabad. Police shot dead four men who had been arrested for the attack, claiming that they had tried to escape. 
 
""THESE ARE POWERFUL PEOPLE""
Often victims and their families go up against powerful people and harsh caste dynamics, especially in rural India, where two thirds of the country live.
In Hindu Nagar, caste lines are visible from the street. Homes built of cement belong to the upper castes. Mud-and-thatch huts are inhabited by the lower castes. After the attack, dozens of police officers were employed to maintain order as crowds of journalists and politicians descended on the village. 
The two men that the woman had identified as the main perpetrators in her rape - Shivam Trivedi and Shubham Trivedi - are both upper caste members of the family of the village headwoman, Savitri Devi Kundan. Shubham is her son. Shivam is his cousin. Kundan told Reuters that the five accused, including her son, had been falsely accused.
Reuters was unable to contact the men, who are being held in jail in a nearby town. Their family members said they were in talks to engage a lawyer to fight the murder case. Pradyuman Shukla, a lawyer who represented Shivam Trivedi in the rape case, said his client had been ""falsely implicated"" of rape. Shukla said he had not been contacted by the family regarding the murder case.
Dozens of women and young girls from the family of the accused men marched on a dirt road in the village on Saturday shouting slogans refuting the allegations against them. They said the men were innocent and asleep at home that morning of the alleged murder.
They called for a federal inquiry into the incident, and accused the woman of trying to lure Shivam Trivedi into a ""love trap"" for his money. 
""She must have poured petrol over herself to take revenge, since he didn't want to marry her,"" said Preeti Bajpai, the sister of one of the accused, Umesh Bajpai.
Vikrant Vir, the superintendent of police in Unnao district, where Hindu Nagar is situated, told Reuters on Wednesday that an investigation into the case was underway.
""The policemen have been suspended for dereliction of duty. A special investigation team has been formed on my recommendation, and we are probing the case.""   
The Uttar Pradesh government spokesperson did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment.
Most lower-caste women do not study past high school in Hindu Nagar, and many are married by their teens, villagers said. The victim was among the few who had graduated. She applied to become a policewoman but missed the interview last year as the public bus she took had been late, her father said. She didn't try again because vacancies in the Uttar Pradesh police are infrequent, her father said.     
While Indian society is changing, its age-old caste system remains powerful in conservative villages like Hindu Nagar.
Based on identity determined at birth, the hierarchical social order, prevalent in Hinduism, deems romantic relationships that cut across caste lines as socially unacceptable.
The woman's relations with Shivam were seen as unacceptable by many upper caste people in the village, more than a dozen villagers Reuters interviewed said.     
It was in Dec. 2018 that she first went to the police to file a complaint saying that Shivam Trivedi and Shubham Trivedi had misled her into accompanying them to the fields and raping her at gunpoint on Dec. 12. She got home and told her aunt and the local police the same day, according to her complaint. 
She filed at least three complaints to police between Dec. 2018 and Feb. 2019 accusing the men of rape. Police registered her case in March, according to copies of the complaints reviewed by Reuters.
In that March 5 report, the woman alleged Shubham Trivedi had raped her multiple times in 2018 and made false promises of marriage. At one point, he took her to the neighboring city of Rae Bareilly and briefly locked her up in a room, threatening to kill her if she tried escaping, the report said.
Over the next few months, she wrote repeatedly to the police, asking them to speed up the investigation and arrest the accused. ""Despite my complaints, neither have I been medically checked, nor has my statement been taken, and nor have my rapists been arrested,"" she said in an April 1 letter to police. Police did not respond to comment on the letter.
""Because of police inaction, the family of the accused are emboldened and are harassing my family and threatening me to force me to withdraw my case."" 
In an April 15 letter, she said her life and her family's was threatened, ""These are powerful people with a lot of money,"" she said in an April 15 letter. ""Our life is under threat.""
She moved to an aunt's home in Rae Bareilly in March, fearing for her life, according to the police reports. But she returned weeks before the incident because she missed her family, her aunt said. 
""I had asked her not to go back,"" she said, referring to the village.
In a July 12 letter, the woman threatened to kill herself if police didn't act on her rape complaint.
Shivam was arrested on Sept. 19, but was out on bail on Nov. 30 – days before she was set on fire.
'NOW WHO WILL FIGHT?'
When the shopkeeper Prakash saw the woman on the morning of her attack, the ends of her short hair were scalded and her clothes had been burned off her body, he said. Still, she had walked nearly half a mile from the fields where she was attacked to his shop in trying to reach the police station, police said. 
The Uttar Pradesh government has promised the woman's family a payment of 2.5 million rupees ($35,000), and a gun license for the woman's brother to protect the family. It has also suspended seven policemen from the area for negligence. Calls to the phones of the suspended policemen went unanswered.
The mud hut where the woman lived had few belongings except a wooden bed, religious idols on walls, and a small basil plant that the family worshipped - a common practice in Hindu homes. Her grieving family said they were living in fear of reprisals from the accused men.
""She was the only educated and sensible person in the family,"" said one of her uncles, breaking down as he spoke. ""None of the men in our family are as brave as she was. She was fighting all alone,"" he said, referring to the hierarchy in the village. ""Now who will fight?""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Island nations and poor coastal countries facing the severest effects of climate change offer a ""moral call to the rest of the world"" to act now, former U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday.
""For those of you who are... experiencing the effects of it right now, there may be some hard questions in terms of adaptation versus mitigation,"" Obama said at a youth leaders conference in Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur, organized by the Obama Foundation.
Island countries that could disappear due to rising sea levels had on Thursday accused rich nations of losing sight of the urgency of the crisis, as a U.N. summit enters the final stretch of negotiations for countries to honor the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming.
""Your voice, your witness to what's happening right here and now, is a moral call to the rest of the world. And figuring out how to tell the story of what you are seeing, and the losses that are already taking place, that's going to be important.""
The United States signed onto the 2015 Paris Agreement during Obama's presidency, promising a 26-28% cut in emissions by 2025 from 2005 levels. But the administration of Obama's successor Donald Trump filed paperwork last week to withdraw from the pact.
The Paris accord aims to avoid the most catastrophic scenarios foreseen by climate scientists by limiting the rise in average global temperatures caused by burning fossil fuels.
Once it exits, the United States - the top historic greenhouse gas emitter and leading oil and gas producer - will become the only country outside the accord.
Obama said that it is up to the world's youth to lead the charge in dealing with climate change, blaming the previous generation for failing to handle the issue ""the way it should have"".
""The oceans will be rising, and that is going to displace people. So we'll to have to anticipate and care for some of the consequences, including large scale migrations and disruptions. That's going to be very possible,"" Obama said.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 04:06AM ET</span>",Britain speeds towards Brexit as Johnson wins large majority in election,"By Guy Faulconbridge and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a resounding election victory on Friday that will allow him to end three years of political paralysis and take Britain out of the European Union by Jan. 31.
Brexit represents the country's biggest political and economic gamble since World War Two, cutting the world's fifth largest economy adrift from the vast trading bloc and threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom. 
For Johnson, who campaigned on a vow to ""Get Brexit Done"", victory was a vindication after anti-Brexit opponents tried one maneuver after another to thwart him during his first chaotic months in office.
""We will get Brexit done on time by the 31st of January, no ifs, no buts, no maybes,"" a triumphant Johnson told supporters at a rally in London.
""Leaving the European Union as one United Kingdom, taking back control of our laws, borders, money, our trade, immigration system, delivering on the democratic mandate of the people,"" he said, reprising the refrains of his successful Brexit referendum campaign of 2016.
Sterling soared, on course for one of its biggest one-day gains in the past two decades
Nearly half a century after Britain joined the EU, Johnson must now strike new international trade deals, preserving London's position as a top global financial capital and keeping the United Kingdom together.
That last goal looks more challenging, with Scotland voting for a nationalist party that wants an independence referendum, and Irish nationalists performing strongly in Northern Ireland.
""Boris Johnson may have a mandate to take England out of the European Union. He emphatically does not have a mandate to take Scotland out of the European Union,"" said Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.
Her Scottish National Party (SNP) won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in the national parliament.
RED WALL CRUMBLES
In England, the Conservatives won large numbers of seats in the opposition Labour Party's so-called Red Wall, declining industrial heartlands once hostile to Johnson's party.
Brexit, which has shattered old party loyalties and divided Britain along new fault lines, was the cause of the shift. In the Red Wall, a majority of voters favored leaving the European Union and rejected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's ambiguous stance on the issue.
In a symbolic win, the Conservatives took Sedgefield, once held by former Prime Minister Tony Blair, Labour's most successful leader. 
Educated at Eton, the country's most elite private school, and known for his bombastic rhetoric, Johnson seemed to critics to be an unlikely candidate to win over working class communities, but Brexit helped him redraw the electoral map.
In his victory speech, he struck a rare note of humility as he addressed voters who had deserted Labour in his favor.
""Your hand may have quivered over the ballot paper before you put your cross in the Conservative box, and you may hope to return to Labour next time round, and if that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Johnson.
""Britain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT. This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the E.U.,"" Trump wrote on Twitter ""Celebrate Boris!""
European politicians were less enthusiastic.
German lawmaker Norbert Roettgen of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party said ""the British people have decided and we have to accept their choice. With Johnson's victory Brexit has become inevitable"".
NO MORE DELAYS
Johnson, 55, will now be able to lead Britain out of the EU by Jan. 31, 10 months after the original deadline of March 29, which was repeatedly pushed back as a gridlocked parliament failed to take any clear decisions on Brexit.
However, with the complex task of negotiating his country's future relationship with the bloc still ahead of him, he may struggle to reunite a divided nation. 
Many voters regard him as a populist charlatan who played fast and loose with the facts and made unrealistic promises.
But his landslide win marks the ultimate failure of the anti-Brexit camp, who tried to thwart the 2016 referendum vote through complex legislative maneuvers and could not convert huge anti-Brexit street protests into a coherent political strategy.
With Labour split and unclear on Brexit, the strongly anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats had hoped to do well but they won only 11 seats, a crushing result. Party leader Jo Swinson lost her seat in Scotland to the SNP and resigned.
With results in from all but one of the 650 parliamentary seats, the Conservatives had won 364, their biggest election win since Margaret Thatcher's 1987 triumph.
Labour, led since 2015 by the veteran socialist Corbyn, had won just 203 seats, the party's worst result since 1935.
Corbyn's offer of nationalizations and big state spending failed to win over voters, while his equivocal position on Brexit left many angry and confused, especially in Red Wall areas where large majorities had voted for Brexit in 2016.
Corbyn said he would quit as Labour leader after a ""process of reflection"". 
The party now faces a brutal battle between Corbyn's socialist followers and his centrist critics.
A SOFTER BREXIT?
After Jan. 31, Britain will enter a transition period during which it will negotiate a new relationship with the EU.
This can run until the end of 2022, but the Conservatives have pledged not to extend the transition beyond 2020.
A big majority may allow Johnson to extend trade talks beyond 2020 because he could overrule the Brexit hardline European Research Group (ERG) faction in the party.
""The bigger the Tory majority of course the less influence over this the ERG and Eurosceptics will have,"" said hardline Brexiteer Nigel Farage, whose anti-EU campaigning played a major part in persuading former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to call the 2016 referendum. 
""It will be called Brexit but it won't really be,"" Farage said.
Johnson was helped by Farage's Brexit Party, which stood down hundreds of candidates to prevent the pro-Brexit vote from being split. The insurgent party poached a significant number of voters from Labour.
In his victory speech, Johnson gave no details of how he would handle Brexit after Jan. 31. Instead, he made a typically light-hearted offer to his supporters.
""Let's get Brexit done but first, my friends, let's get breakfast done.""

The United States carried out the test on Thursday. Washington formally withdrew from the 1987 INF pact with Russia in August after determining that Moscow was violating the treaty, an accusation the Kremlin has denied.
""It alarms us. Of course we will take this into account,"" said Vladimir Ermakov, head of the foreign ministry's arms control and non-proliferation department. 
It was the second test by the United States that would have been prohibited under the INF treaty and too place as the future of another major nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the United States is under question.

Stephen Biegun will be in Seoul for a three-day stay and hold consultations with his counterpart Lee Do-hoon and other officials, South Korea's foreign ministry said on Friday.
""The two sides will exchange extensive views on the recent situation on the Korean peninsula and discuss ways to bring substantial progress on achieving a complete denuclearization and enduring peace,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Tension has been rising in recent weeks as Pyongyang has conducted a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with U.S. President Donald Trump, stoking fears the two countries could return to a collision course that they had been on before launching diplomacy last year.
Biegun's trip sparked speculation he might try to salvage negotiations by reaching out to North Korea, or by publicly sending a message.
North Korea has vowed to take an unspecified ""new path"" if the United States fails to address its demands before the end of the year.
On Thursday, it said Washington had ""nothing to offer"" even if talks were to reopen, and the United States warned against any resumption of ""unfortunate ill-advised behavior"".
""In any case, Biegun would try to give an impression that they won't be manipulated by the North Koreans, while making clear that they want to keep talking,"" a diplomatic source in Seoul said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Trump met three times since last year to negotiate an end to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but there has been scant progress, with working-level talks led by Biegun in October in Stockholm breaking down.
U.S. officials came to that meeting seeking a ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,"" and a moratorium on weapons tests as a first step, while a North Korean negotiator accused them of sticking to their ""old viewpoint and attitude."""

On a visit to Bangkok, Admiral John Aquilino, 56, criticized China's construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea, a vital trade waterway with rich energy resources where Beijing has disputes with five nations.
""We are in competition with the People's Republic of China,"" Aquilino told reporters.
""We have inherent disagreement between ideologies. When the U.S. talks about values, those are values that like minded nations share... And I believe that the strength of partnerships with those values will be what keeps the nations in the region secure.""
Tensions are high between China and the United States in Asia's waters, where Washington says it is defending freedom of navigation in accordance with international law and Beijing accuses the United States of trying to stir trouble.
""I said we were in competition with China but that does not mean conflict,"" Aquilino said. ""We will cooperate where we can and we will compete where we must.""
Under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, some Southeast Asian nations have been concerned at a possible U.S. pullback just as China's dominance grows, but Aquilino said the United States would be in the region for years to come.
He cited so-called freedom of navigation operations in both the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait in which U.S. and allied warships have sailed through what China claims as its territorial waters, provoking Beijing's ire.
He said that in the South China Sea, China had built features in defiance of international law, that damage the environment, have a military purpose and ""ultimately coerce and bully nations in the region."""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A divisive citizenship bill has been signed into law in India, a move that comes amid widespread protests in the country's northeast that could force the cancellation of a visit by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Two people were killed and 11 injured on Thursday when police opened fire on mobs in Assam state torching buildings and attacking railway stations. Protesters say the law would convert thousands of illegal immigrants into legal residents.
The new law lays out a path of Indian citizenship for six minority religious groups from the neighboring countries of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Indian President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the bill late on Thursday, signing it into law, an official statement said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has planned to host Abe at a meeting in Assam next week as part of a campaign to move high-profile diplomatic events outside Delhi to showcase India's diversity.
Japan's Jiji Press reported on Friday that Abe is considering cancelling his trip. India's foreign ministry said it was not in a position to comment on the visit which was originally planned for Dec 15-17.
A movement against immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh has raged in Assam for decades. Protesters say granting Indian nationality to more people will further strain the resources of the tea growing state and lead to the marginalization of indigenous communities.
Japan has stepped up infrastructure development work in Assam in recent years which the two sides were expected to highlight during the summit. Abe had also planned to visit a memorial in the nearby state of Manipur where Japanese soldiers were killed during World War Two.
Critics of Modi's Hindu nationalist government say the bigger problem with the new law is that it is the first time India is using religion as a criterion for granting citizenship and that it excludes Muslims from its ambit.
The law seeks to grant Indian nationality to Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs who fled the three Muslim-majority neighboring countries before 2015.
The Indian Union Muslim League party has petitioned the Supreme Court saying the law was in conflict with the secular principles of India's constitution that guaranteed equality to all without any regard to religion. No date has yet been set for the hearings.
The party said the law is ""prima facie communal"" and questioned the exclusion of minorities such as Rohingya Muslims who were just as persecuted as other faiths listed in the law."

WHAKATANE/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A New Zealand military team in gas masks and hazmat suits recovered six bodies on Friday from the volcanic island that fatally erupted earlier this week, as doctors worked to save badly burned survivors. 
An eight-person bomb disposal squad set off before dawn and spent four hours on White Island, which experts said could erupt again. 
Six of the eight bodies on the island were successfully retrieved and taken to a naval patrol vessel for transfer to the mainland for disaster victim identification.
""Today was all about returning them to their loved ones,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told a media conference in Whakatane, the mainland coastal town where about 100 family and local community members prayed and sang together.
""We know that reunion won't ease that sense of loss, of suffering because I don't think anything can but we felt an enormous sense of duty as New Zealanders to bring their loved ones home.""
The team was unable to find and recover the remaining two bodies as the cumbersome protective equipment they needed to wear slowed down the tricky operation. 
Police said dive teams deployed in the waters around the island, which is also known by its Maori name of Whakaari, had not found anything and would try again on Saturday.
""It's not over yet,"" New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush told reporters in Whakatane, some 50 km (30 miles) west of the island. 
Pictures showed pairs of military personnel wearing breathing apparatus scouring the lunar-like landscape as inflatable dinghies and a police launch waited offshore.
The volcano, a popular tourist destination for day-trippers, erupted on Monday, spewing ash, steam and gases over the island. Among the 47 people on the island at the time were Australian, U.S., German, Chinese, British and Malaysian tourists.
The official death toll stands at eight as the bodies on the island have been classified as missing until they are formally identified. More than two dozen more people are in hospitals across New Zealand and Australia, most with severe burn injuries.
A blessing was held at sea with the victims' families before the mission was launched. 
Locals Boz Te Moana, 24 and Michael Mika, 28, came to support families gathered at the marae, a Maori community center, in Whakatane.
""Where we come from we don’t leave anyone behind, no one gets left behind,"" Te Moana said of his Maori community. ""We all move as one.""
Relatives sat among the coffins of those who were recovered on Friday, not knowing which belonged to their family member, senior legislator Kelvin Davis told reporters.
""But it was just an opportunity, as they said, regardless of whether we're from Australia or New Zealand or wherever, that the moment we're one whanau (family) and will mourn everybody as if they are our own.""

SKIN SUPPLIES
Australians made up the majority of the tourists visiting the island at the time of the explosion and those recovered on Friday. 
Many of them were passengers on a Royal Caribbean Cruises ship on a day tour to the island. 
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said 11 injured Australians have been transferred from overloaded burns units in New Zealand, with one more to be repatriated in the ""coming days"".
Peter Haertsch, the doctor in charge of the burns unit caring for the returned Australians, said they been exposed to fast-moving clouds of very hot volcanic gas, pumice and ash.
""They have suffered severe contact skin burns with severe injuries due to inhalation of gas and ash, and we are looking at extensive and intensive care for these patients, some of whom are still in a life-threatening condition,"" Haertsch said in an emailed statement.
Payne said Australia was working with the United States and other countries to source some of the urgently needed 1.2 million square cms (186,000 square inches) of skin, an amount that far exceeds annual donations in New Zealand and Australia.
""It's jarring for us to hear just the sheer scale of that need because it amplifies just how horrific some of the injuries are,"" Ardern told ABC Radio.

QUESTIONS OVER RISK
Authorities had faced growing pressure in recent days from families of some victims to recover the bodies as soon as possible. 
There has also been criticism that tourists were allowed on the island at all, given the risks of an active volcano. 
Pressed to discuss whether the island should have been open, Ardern said she didn't want to preempt an inquiry which has been launched.
""I think families would be best served by that, rather than speculation.""

575,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 11:49PM ET</span>",U.S. officials 'pause' Taliban talks after suicide attack,"KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. negotiators are taking a ""brief pause"" from talks with the Taliban after the militants launched a suicide attack on a U.S. base outside Kabul killing two civilians, Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad said on Friday.
Khalilzad had renewed talks with the Taliban earlier this month on steps that could lead to a ceasefire and a settlement of the 18-year-long war in Afghanistan.
""I met Talibs today, I expressed outrage about attack on Bagram,"" Khalilzad wrote on Twitter, referring to the attack on Bagram air base on Wednesday which killed two people and injured more than 70 others.
""We're taking a brief pause for them to consult their leadership on this essential topic,"" he added.
Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said Friday's meeting was ""very good and friendly"".
""Both sides decided to resume the talks after a few days of break for consultation,"" he said.
The assault on Bagram base came despite the resumption of talks between the United States and the insurgent group days before in Qatar, as the parties look for a path to reduce violence or even reach a ceasefire, allowing a gradual withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from Afghanistan.
Peace negotiations began earlier this year, though U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly suspended talks in September citing an attack in Kabul in which an American soldier was killed.
Trump paid a surprise Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan last month and said the United States and the Taliban had been engaged in ongoing peace talks and the Taliban wanted a ceasefire.
Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians, security officials and more than 2,400 American service members have been killed in the almost two-decade-old war.

Rachel Noble will become next director-general of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), which intercepts electronic communications from foreign countries.
""Her appointment to this leadership role is a significant step forward for women in the national security sector and we congratulate her,"" Morrison and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said in a statement.
Noble, who will begin her new role in February 2020, will lead the ASD at a time when Australia is increasingly concerned about cyber-attacks.
In March, the ASD concluded China’s Ministry of State Security was responsible for a cyber-attack on its parliament and three major political parties, Reuters reported.
Australia decided not to go public with its findings for fear of risking its trade ties with China, two sources said.
China denies it was responsible for the hack."

While the Pacific states are small developing nations, they lie in highly strategic waters dominated by the United States and its allies since World War Two. China's moves to expand its footprint there have angered Washington.
Democratic Taiwan has faced intense pressure from China, which claims the island as its territory with no right to state-to-state ties, over its remaining diplomatic allies. Taiwan lost two Pacific states in September and now only has 15 formal allies worldwide.
Speaking at a welcoming ceremony in Taipei, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen extended a ""heartfelt welcome"" to Nauru President Lionel Aingimea, who took office in August and stopped over in Taiwan in September on the way back from the United Nations.
""Nauru is a staunch Pacific ally of Taiwan,"" Tsai said. ""This time you are leading a state visit, demonstrating your firm support of our nations' diplomatic ties.""
Aingimea told Tsai that the people of Taiwan are part of their family.
""Nauru is much smaller compared to Taiwan in population, size and infrastructure, but our hearts are linked as one,"" he added. ""Nauru will always stand side by side with Taiwan in the future that we are going forward together with.""
The United States has urged Taiwan's remaining friends in the Pacific to stick with Taipei. Washington has no diplomatic ties with Taipei, but is the island's strongest international backer and main arms supplier.
China meanwhile has continued its Pacific push.
Later on Friday, China is hosting one of its Pacific friends, with President Xi Jinping set to meet Micronesia's President David Panuelo.
Though Pacific Island states offer little economically to either China and Taiwan, their support is valued in global forums such as the United Nations and as China seeks to isolate Taiwan.
China has offered to help developing countries including in the Pacific, and many see Chinese lending as the best bet to develop their economies.
But critics say Chinese loans can lead countries into a ""debt trap"", and Taiwan has said China has dangled huge aid packages in front of countries to get them to switch over to Beijing.
China has angrily rejected these charges."

LONDON (Reuters) - After all the arguments and all the mass marches, opponents of Brexit faced a stark truth on Friday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's likely election landslide: there would be no second referendum; divorce from Europe was inevitable.
With the Conservatives set to win their largest majority since 1987, Johnson will be able to push his divorce deal through parliament, allowing Britain to leave the EU next month.
It would be the country's most significant geopolitical move since World War Two.
Some supporters of another Brexit vote blamed themselves for the crushing defeat. The main organization campaigning for a second referendum imploded, while the opposition Labour leader was ambivalent, pledging to stay neutral in another vote.
""I am distraught, and like everyone else in the remain community wish we had more competent representation,"" said Mike Galsworthy, an anti-Brexit campaigner, who was sipping a whisky before going to bed after seeing the exit polls come in.
The 2016 referendum on EU membership has been the most polarizing issue in recent British history, crystallizing divisions between cities and towns, young and old, the winners of globalization and those left behind.
For many pro-Europeans in Britain, another referendum represented the best chance of ending the turmoil and political paralysis. If they had united into a single political force, they may have stood a chance of overturning the result.
In addition to their own shortcomings, so-called ""remainers"" were outmaneuvered.
Over the past three years, support for remaining in the EU has led in almost every opinion poll, prompting some of the largest street protests in recent Britain's history. Parliament twice forced Brexit to be delayed.
But the main opposition parties failed to work together to forge a functional cross-party alliance, mystifying millions of Britons.
While the Conservatives consolidated the vote of those who want to leave the EU, building a coalition of pro-Brexit voters across regional and class lines, campaigners for another referendum struggled to win converts or agree on a unified plan.
DIVIDED
Gina Miller, a prominent campaigner for a second referendum, was among those accepted there was no way back.
""There is certainly not another vote,"" she said, adding that Brexit would ""get passed as an act of parliament, it will then be ratified as an international treaty and we will be out.""
Key to the defeat for the ""Remain"" camp was Labour's refusal to join an initiative aimed at encouraging tactical voting, whereby people back a candidate in order block another rather than out of genuine support.
By contrast, the newly created Brexit Party agreed not to run against Conservatives in about half of constituencies to avoid diluting the pro-Brexit vote.
Many campaigners said the fate of their movement was inextricably linked with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the least popular opposition leader in living memory.
The most likely route to a second referendum would have been if Corbyn had become prime minister. In the end, Britons voted with their feet and not their ballot papers.
Other campaigners blamed strategic errors, such as agreeing to an early election when the prime minister was trapped in parliament, unable to pass his Brexit deal unamended.
Johnson got the election he wanted when the opposition parties' united front against a vote broke."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Salvadoran man seeking asylum in the United States was kidnapped and murdered in the Mexican border city of Tijuana where he was sent to wait for his asylum court hearing under a migrant protection program instated by President Donald Trump.
Critics of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) have argued that the migrants affected by the initiative, mostly from the impoverished and violence-plagued countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, are at risk in Mexico.
""They sent us back. We said Tijuana was really dangerous, there was a lot of crime but they didn't listen to us. They said that they couldn't do anything because those were Trump's orders,"" the man's widow said.
The widow and her lawyer asked for her and her husband's name to remain anonymous for security reasons.
Along the U.S.-Mexico border, the migrants, many of them babies and toddlers, are living in high-crime cities, often in crowded shelters and tents or on the streets - for the weeks or months it takes to get a U.S. asylum hearing.
The 35-year-old Salvadoran man, father of two, had waited for four months in Tijuana where he had found a job at a pizzeria, said his widow.
""They kidnapped my husband, he disappeared and unfortunately when I found him he was dead,"" said the widow.
He was killed on Nov. 20 after being stabbed in the neck, chest and abdomen, according to a death certificate seen by Reuters on Thursday.
Mexican authorities said the man was ""dismembered"" and they are investigating the circumstances surrounding his death.
Since MPP was launched in January 54,000 migrants have been sent to wait in Mexico for their U.S. immigration court hearings.
A report released last week by the New York City-based organization Human Rights First found at least 636 publicly reported cases of kidnapping, rape, torture, assault, and other violent attacks against migrants sent to Mexico under the program.
""We didn't cross over illegally, we crossed over the right way, we waited our turn to do things right. That's why this is so unfair,"" said the widow.
Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan on Monday rejected the idea that the Trump administration was responsible for attacks on migrants waiting in Mexico and blamed criminal organizations.
A dozen years of gang-fueled violence have claimed well over 200,000 lives in Mexico and murders hit record levels last year. They are on track for another record year in 2019."

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Canadian lawyer William Schabas, an international scholar on genocide, has been criticized by friend and foe for first researching crimes against the Muslim Rohingya of Myanmar, and now defending the state accused of perpetrating them.
Schabas helped research a report in 2010 on systematic attacks against the Rohingya, which concluded that they met the international threshold of crimes against humanity.
Three years later, in an Al Jazeera documentary, he was filmed saying: ""Denying their history, denying the legitimacy of their right to live where they live, these are all warning signs that mean that it's not frivolous to envisage the use of the word genocide.""
This week Schabas stood alongside Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi at the International Court of Justice in The Hague and denied genocide https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-world-court/myanmars-suu-kyi-urges-world-court-to-drop-genocide-case-idUSKBN1YG0QO took place during a military campaign in 2017 in which thousands were killed and raped and hundreds of thousands displaced.
""William Schabas is basically selling out the Rohingya for some Myanmar gov't $$$. Really the worst sort of behavior, how totally immoral and two-faced,"" Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch said on Twitter on Thursday.
In an interview with Reuters, Schabas rejected the criticism.
""I am an international lawyer. I do international law cases,"" he said at a book launch after three grueling days in court where he argued the crimes did not constitute genocide.
""Both sides have a right to have competent representation. If people don't understand that, that's not my problem,"" he said.
Stephen Rapp, a former United States war crimes ambassador who works at the Holocaust museum, was among colleagues who criticized Schabas. 
""We have heard this morning from my friend Bill Schabas, I was just with him 10 days ago. I prosecuted genocide, we obtained convictions for this crime. He is wrong about the law: this was a genocide,"" Rapp told journalists and NGOs in The Hague on Wednesday evening.
In court the following day, Schabas tried to clarify his 2013 remarks in the Al Jazeera documentary ""The Hidden Genocide"". 
Schabas said he was responding to a hypothetical, not the real situation in Myanmar.
""The journalist persistently tried to get me to apply the word genocide ... And I just as persistently refused, cause I've never said that genocide was taking place in Myanmar.""
NO GENOCIDE DENIALIST
In the Reuters interview Schabas also countered criticism of his views about the events in Srebrenica, Bosnia, when around 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred by Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995.
""He, frankly, doesn't think Srebrenica was (genocide) and that was found by the courts (to be genocide),"" said Rapp. ""The position he takes on genocide is in my view entirely too restrictive"".
Schabas said he has accepted that Srebrenica was genocide.
""I am not arguing with anybody about whether genocide took place in Srebrenica. That has been decided. That train has left the station and the fact that I had an opinion about it before the decisions were reached seems to me to be quite normal and understandable,"" he said. 
His distinct interpretation of the crime of genocide has led some people to call him a genocide denialist, a criticism he rebuffed.
""If you discuss genocide and you suggest that this probably doesn't fit the definition of international law, very quickly some people say you are denying, they say you're denying genocide, as if you're, you know, a Nazi sympathizer whose claiming that Auschwitz didn't exist, which most of the time is not the case. 
""Your old debate about Srebrenica was not whether it happened or not, it's not about that. It's about whether the legal qualification should be crimes against humanity rather than genocide,"" Schabas said.
Defending a party accused of genocide is never going to be a popular job, said Sareta Ashraph, an international lawyer who considers the events in Myanmar a ""slow-burn genocide"".
""For him a genocide has to involve a substantial number of dead, he relies on body count,"" she said. ""I think he's actually the perfect person for that case, although I disagree with his arguments. It's not an absurd argument, it's just very, very conservative on genocidal intent"".
In 2015, Schabas was forced to resign as the head of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on the Gaza Conflict after a complaint from Israel about his prior work for the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
UN Watch director Hillel Neuer said he told Schabas at the time that he ""had breached his duty of impartiality as head of the UN Human Rights Council inquiry"" because he had made prejudicial statements ""including his call to indict Israel’s prime minister as his 'favorite' defendant ...""
Genocide, Schabas said, is a subject of great sensitivity to people ""and the debates can be not only quite robust, but people get angry very quickly.""

He said his decision to stand in Myanmar's corner was not emotional, but professional. ""I am hired as a lawyer, they're my client.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - In Hong Kong, when the tempo of traffic-light signals accelerates to about 800 ticks a minute, visually impaired residents know they can safely cross the road. But over the past six months of unrest, many streets have lost their beat.
Anti-government activists have smashed more than 700 traffic lights since demonstrations erupted in June, significantly altering the soundtrack of daily life for the southern Chinese-ruled city's estimated 174,800 visually impaired people. 
While images of black-clad protesters hurling petrol bombs and riot police shooting tear gas have become ubiquitous, the visually impaired hear, rather than see, the unrest that has plunged the former British colony into crisis. 
The holes and debris left behind after protesters dig up sidewalk bricks and scatter them across roads to disrupt traffic render pathways disorienting for people with a visual impairment. 
""Suddenly I wonder why the road in front of me is now broken. Am I on the pavement or am I on the road?"" said Joy Luk, 41, a blind lawyer who stands on the frontlines of protests and offers general legal advice to demonstrators.
""The people in Hong Kong think that as disabled people, we can do nothing to contribute to the betterment of society,"" Luk said. ""Protesting is a way to express my opinion and to show my ability to others.""
Demonstrating, however, is not easy for Luk, who taps a white cane to feel for obstacles and relies on bystanders to guide her. 
""Many people tell me to go straight, but for a blind person it is very hard to go straight,"" said Luk, who tends to veer left as she walks. 
BEAUTIFUL HEARTS AND MINDS
At a recent protest, several demonstrators' hands threaded through Luk's arm as they walked together along the route and offered grapes or homemade walnut cookies.
Recalling photos of Hong Kong she saw when she was younger and still had vision, Luk said: ""Now the picture itself is not beautiful, but the hearts and minds of the people are very beautiful.""
Luk was born with 3% vision in one eye and lost all sight before she was 30. 
Billy Wong, a 38-year-old visually impaired theology student, also supports the anti-government movement but has found himself increasingly home-bound due to escalating violence. 
The ""unified voice"" he said he heard at earlier mass protests has been overtaken by the cacophony from clashes between protesters and police. 
""When you turn on the TV ... You hear people demonstrating, running. They are screaming. These sounds are so strange and unfamiliar to Hong Kong people,"" Wong said. 
Wong finds it difficult to imagine the mass rallies. 
""I would never be able to form an image of hundreds of thousands of people in one place,"" Wong said. ""What would the scene look like? I can't imagine.""
TRANSLATING IMAGES
One Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group has stepped into the breach by describing images and videos in text that can be dictated by phones. 
Dorothy Ngan, one of the group's five editors, said the 20 volunteer audio describers found it increasingly harrowing to repeatedly watch the violent scenes that have been playing out on Hong Kong's streets.""Sometimes, I look at the photo and I can't write. Sometimes, I cry,"" Ngan said.
Another challenge for people with low vision or blindness has been the sudden closure of subway stations due to safety concerns. 
W., a 50-year-old visually impaired woman who asked to be identified by her initial, plans her subway trips to the last step. 
""If the entrance or lift is closed, it would be like hitting a dead end in a maze,"" she said.
W. described Hong Kong before the protests as ""a far away memory"".
For Luk, the pro-democracy movement could be a step towards stronger legal protection for disadvantaged groups.

""If the system is fair to everyone, maybe we as minority groups can also have better rights,"" she said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Women and girls in Argentina seeking to end pregnancies caused by rape will be guaranteed access to abortion under a protocol announced on Thursday aimed at reducing the latitude hospitals have in deciding whether or not to perform the procedure.
Argentine law allows abortion in case of rape or threat to the life or health of the mother. But abortion rights advocates say the law is not always applied across the largely Roman Catholic country and that local hospitals have too much power to decide which cases fall under the legal criteria.
""The protocol will be used as a guide, especially in cases where the law clearly allows for the interruption of pregnancies,"" Health Minister Gines Gonzalez Garcia told a news conference. He was sworn in on Tuesday after moderate Peronist President Alberto Fernandez was inaugurated.
""We are respectful of conscientious objection but conscientious objection cannot be used as an institutional alibi for not complying with the law,"" Gonzalez Garcia added.
Rights group Amnesty International issued a statement celebrating the new protocol, which goes into effect on Friday. Only Uruguay, Cuba and Guyana have legalized abortion in Latin America, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
The region has some of the world’s most restrictive abortion laws, with a handful of countries, mostly in Central America, banning abortion under any circumstances.
Argentina's former health secretary quit last month after a protocol he had signed, aimed at making abortion more available, was revoked by then-President Mauricio Macri, a conservative. Macri was defeated by Fernandez in the October election.
Fernandez has said he favors abortion rights. Proposals to widen the availability of abortion have been batted back and forth between the lower house and Senate for years.
There are at least 350,000 illegal abortions in the country every year, the Ministry of Health estimates, although international human rights groups say the number may be higher."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution that recognizes as a genocide the mass killings of Armenians a century ago, a historic move that infuriated Turkey and dealt a blow to the already problematic ties between Ankara and Washington.
Turkey condemned the measure, which passed a month after an official visit to the White House by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who enjoys a special rapport with President Donald Trump, amid mounting issues that have soured the relationship between the two NATO allies.
Trump had cast his Nov. 13 meeting with Erdogan as ""wonderful"" despite no concrete breakthrough on deep disagreements such as Ankara's purchase of Russian weapon systems and diverging views on Syria policy.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives had passed the resolution by an overwhelming majority in October. But a vote in the Senate was repeatedly blocked by Trump's fellow Republican senators since meeting with Erdogan.
""This is a tribute to the memory of 1.5 million victims of the first #Genocide of the 20th century and bold step in promotion of the prevention agenda. #NeverAgain,"" Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan tweeted in English.
The resolution asserts that it is U.S. policy to commemorate as genocide the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923. The Ottoman Empire was centered in present-day Turkey.
Turkey accepts that many Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were killed in clashes with Ottoman forces during World War One, but contests the figures and denies that the killings were systematically orchestrated and constitute a genocide.
Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the decision a ""political show"" while presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Ankara strongly condemned and rejected the measure. The resolution is nonbinding.
""History will note these resolutions as irresponsible and irrational actions by some members of the US Congress against Turkey,"" Fahrettin Altun, Turkey's communications director, said on Twitter in response.
VINDICATION
Congressional aides said the White House does not want the legislation to move ahead while it negotiates with Ankara on sensitive issues. However, since the visit, Erdogan repeatedly said Turkey has no intention of dropping the Russian S-400 air defense missile systems it has bought, crushing any hopes for progress.
For decades, measures recognizing the Armenian genocide have stalled in the U.S. Congress, stymied by concerns about relations with Turkey and intense lobbying by Ankara.
""I've invested like decades of my life,"" said Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America. ""So it was a sense of relief and a bit of a vindication that ... (the United) States recognized the history of the Armenians, but also put up a firewall against foreign countries coming into our democracy and dictating to us.""
The U.S. Congress has been united in its opposition to Turkey's recent policy actions. Republican senators have been incensed with Turkey's purchase of the S-400, which the United States says pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and cannot be integrated into NATO defenses.
They have also moved to punish Turkey over its Oct. 9 incursion into Syria. A U.S. Senate committee backed legislation on Wednesday to impose sanctions on Turkey, pushing Trump to take a harder line on the issue, as many lawmakers blame Trump for giving a green light to Ankara for its military offensive.

To become law, that legislation would have to pass the House of Representatives, which passed its own Turkish sanctions bill by an overwhelming 403-16 vote in October, and be signed by Trump.

(Reuters) - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd's potential liability for a deadly excursion to a volcanic island in New Zealand could hinge on whether the eruption was an unforeseeable ""act of God,"" according to maritime lawyers.
Cruise ship passengers were among the tourists on White Island on Monday when it erupted. While no lawsuits have yet been filed, legal experts said they expected action in U.S courts by injured passengers and families of those who died.
There were 47 people on the island at the time. Eight have been officially declared dead and more than 20 are being treated for severe burns. The New Zealand military was carrying out an operation to recover eight other bodies still on the island.
Royal Caribbean ticket terms posted on its website spell out that the company is not liable for any injury, death or loss of property caused by an act of God, as well as war, terrorism or other events beyond the company's control.
Royal Caribbean will likely argue the disaster was an extraordinary event no one could reasonably foresee, said Robert Kritzman, an attorney with Baker Donelson in Miami.
""If a volcano were to erupt, clearly that isn't negligence on anyone's part, that's nature,"" said Kritzman, a former general counsel with Norwegian Cruise Line.
Royal Caribbean did not respond to questions about missing passengers or whether it told passengers of the risks of visiting the island.
""We grieve this tragic loss. We will to continue to offer our support and services to the families during this difficult time,"" the company said in an email.
Part of the case will turn on what the cruise line knew or should have known and what they told passengers about indications of increased volcanic activity.
""There are tremors, there are earthquakes and people monitor that,"" said Carlos Llinás Negret, an attorney with Nelson & Fraenkel who represents passengers. ""It all depends on what the cruise knew, and when they knew it.""
Geological hazard tracker GeoNet raised the alert level for the White Island volcano in November and said on Dec. 3 that ""the volcano may be entering a period where eruptive activity is more likely than normal.""
The cruise line described White Island as ""one of the most active volcanoes in the world,"" according to a cached version of its website. ""Get close to the drama: Gas masks help you get near roaring steam vents, bubbling pits of mud, hot volcanic streams and the amazing lake of steaming acid,"" it promised.
Virginia parents of one woman who was severely burned told a TV station that her daughter said she believed Royal Caribbean would not have let her visit the island if it were not safe.
The experts said in a typical shore excursion accident the cruise line tries to put blame on the third party that is hired to run the tour. On its website, Royal Caribbean does not identify the company that ran the White Island excursion.
Passengers would have to show Royal Caribbean did not take proper care to vet the operator, lawyers said.
But lawsuits face the added challenge of overcoming the argument the eruption was unforeseeable.
Norwegian Cruise Line was able to fend off a class action lawsuit about a large ""freak wave"" hitting one of its ships in 2005 by arguing it was an unforeseeable event. Regulators had concluded there was no wrongdoing by Norwegian.
Royal Caribbean is using the act of God defense against a class action about a powerful storm in 2016 that hit the ship Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) of the Seas off the eastern United States. Passengers said the company knew of the risks of the storm, but tried to outrun it.
The dramatic description of the White Island tour on Royal Caribbean's website will likely be a focus of any lawsuit, with lawyers seizing on it to show the company knew a disaster was possible, legal experts said. The company could argue passengers were fully informed of the dangers and received proper safety equipment.
""If they hand out gas masks that says automatically you know you have a risk,"" said Bob Parks, a Miami attorney who represents passengers."

The move, which was announced by League leader Matteo Salvini, will make it harder for Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to govern an already fractious coalition and leave him vulnerable to opposition ambushes in the 321-seat Senate.
The walkout by Ugo Grassi, Stefano Lucidi and Francesco Urraro also underscores deep divisions and unhappiness within the ranks of 5-Star, which emerged as Italy’s top party in 2018 national elections but has seen its support halve in recent months as it struggles to get to grips with difficult policy decisions.
""The League has opened a cattle market. It should publish its price list so we can see how much a parliamentarian costs per kilo,” the 5-Star’s embattled leader, Luigi Di Maio, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Salvini has previously rejected suggestions that he might try to poach other party’s parliamentarians in an effort to bring down the government and trigger early elections that opinion polls suggest he would easily win. On Thursday he dismissed suggestions he was buying support.
""We don't have a price,” he said in a statement.
The trio’s departure leaves the coalition on paper with just a 5-seat majority in the Senate, although a number of senators from some small parties, that are not in the government, are likely to keep backing Conte in crunch votes to avert political chaos.
The senators swapped sides after the parliament approved on Wednesday a coalition resolution on a reform of the euro zone bailout fund (ESM). They complained that parliament had been sidelined during discussions on the highly technical mechanism.
The League leads the opposition against the government of the 5-Star and the centre-left Democratic Party, that was formed in August after Salvini walked out of his coalition with the 5-Star in a failed attempt to provoke an early election.
The government won its initial, obligatory vote of confidence in the upper house 169-133 thanks to the backing of some independent senators."

(Reuters) - The Quebec Court of Appeal refused on Thursday to suspend a law banning the wearing of religious symbols by public employees in the Canadian province, although more legal battles await.
The law, which the Quebec government said was designed to preserve ""laicite"" or secularism in the mainly French-speaking province, prohibits many types of civil servants, including teachers and police officers, from wearing religious symbols such as hijabs and turbans on the job.
Multiple lawsuits have been filed claiming the law is discriminatory and unconstitutional.
The appeals court ruling came on a motion by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the National Council of Canadian Muslims that argued the law was outside Quebec’s jurisdiction, impermissibly vague and violated constitutional guarantees of equal access.
The court heard from women who were refused teaching jobs because they wear hijabs. And while judges agreed those women had suffered irreparable harm, in a 2-1 ruling they said that at this stage the court had to assume the impugned law serves a “valid public purpose.”
""I'm beyond disappointed,"" said Noa Mendelsohn Aviv, director of the Civil Liberties Association's Equality Program. 
""We have a horrendous law on the books and we were very much hoping that relief would be granted by the court to people who really need it, who just want to go to work and feed their families and live in a free and equal society. That's what we were hoping for and that did not happen. ... This is a really difficult decision for so many people, not just people who themselves have lost their jobs, but for every person who cares about equality and justice.""
Aviv said it was too early to say whether they would appeal Thursday's ruling. The court challenges to the law continue to move forward.

Washington also blacklisted two of Rafael Ortega's companies that it said he used for laundering money and financing the Ortega government, according to a Treasury statement.
Washington had already blacklisted a number of Nicaraguan officials, including Daniel Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, who is the country's vice president.

A chain of gas stations, Distribuidor Nicaraguense de Petroleo S.A., owned by Rafael Ortega as well as by Murillo was also blacklisted on Thursday.
The Nicaraguan government has called previous U.S. sanctions on officials a continuation of ""imperial"" designs on the small Central American country.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A fatal gun rampage at a kosher grocery store in northern New Jersey this week is now being treated as an act of domestic terrorism and the FBI will oversee the investigation, federal and state law enforcement officials said on Thursday.
Six people, including the man and woman who carried out the attack, three civilians and a police officer died in a series of events that ended in a police shootout on Tuesday in Jersey City, New Jersey, located across the Hudson River from New York City.
""The evidence points toward acts of hate,"" state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal told a news conference. ""We are investigating this matter as potential acts of domestic terror, fueled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs."" 
The U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Craig Carpenito, told the news conference that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would lead the probe.
The four-hour gun battle at the JC Kosher Supermarket erupted after two assailants shot the police officer at a nearby cemetery and then fled in a white van. It ended after police crashed an armored vehicle through the wall of the market. Authorities on Wednesday said that the pair had targeted the kosher grocery store, heading there deliberately after leaving the cemetery.
On Thursday, authorities said they were examining social media posts and other evidence to learn more about the motives of the attackers, who they said had expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelites, a group unaffiliated with mainstream Judaism and some of whose offshoots the Southern (NYSE:SO) Poverty Law Center lists as hate groups. Authorities have not established an official link between the shooters and the group, Grewal said.
The attackers appear to have acted alone, officials said.
Authorities on Wednesday identified the shooters as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50. The three civilian victims inside the market were co-owner Mindy Ferencz, 31, Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, and Moshe Deutsch, 24, they said.
A fourth person who was in the market escaped after the shooters entered. Officials declined to identify that person.
The slain police officer was identified as Joseph Seals, a 15-year veteran of the force and father of five.
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop labeled the incident a hate crime just hours after the attack.
""I think as more info comes out it will be more and more clear not only that this was a hate crime but that the perpetrators had hoped to kill many more people than 4,"" Fulop said on Twitter earlier.
Law enforcement recovered five guns linked to the two suspects, Grewal said. Four of them were recovered inside the kosher supermarket and one was recovered inside the van.
Officials said Anderson fired an AR-15-style weapon and Graham was armed with a 12-gauge shotgun as they entered the store. A 9mm Glock and 9mm semi-automatic firearm were recovered inside the market, and a .22-caliber gun equipped with a homemade silencer was found inside the U-Haul.

Authorities also said they were working to determine if Anderson and Graham were linked to the killing of an Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver in Bayonne, New Jersey, over the weekend.

Gazan Christians will be granted permits to travel abroad but none will be allowed to go to Israel and the occupied West Bank, home to many sites holy to Christians, a spokeswoman for Israel's military liaison to the Palestinians said. 
Israel tightly restricts movements out of the Gaza Strip, territory controlled by Hamas, an Islamist group that it considers a terrorist organization.
The spokeswoman said that following ""security orders"", Gazans would be allowed to travel abroad via Israel's Allenby Bridge border crossing with Jordan but not to visit cities in Israel or the West Bank. 
Gaza has only around 1,000 Christians - most of them Greek Orthodox - among a population of 2 million in the narrow coastal strip. 
This year's decision is a break with usual policy. Last year, Israel granted permits for close to 700 Gazan Christians to travel to Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth and other holy cities that draw thousands of pilgrims each holiday season. 
Gisha, an Israeli rights group, said the ban points ""to the intensifying of access restrictions between the two parts of the Palestinian territory,"" calling it ""a deepening of Israel's separation policy"" for the West Bank and Gaza. 
The Palestinians seek to set up a state in the West Bank and Gaza, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. 
Israel in the past has defended its restrictions on Gazans traveling to the West Bank, saying many Palestinians from Gaza stay on illegally when granted short-term permits.
In Gaza, one Christian woman voiced hope Israel would reverse its policy so she could visit her family in the West Bank city of Ramallah. 
""Every year I pray they will give me a permit so I can celebrate Christmas and see my family,"" Randa El-Amash, 50, said, adding: ""It will be more joyful to celebrate in Bethlehem and in Jerusalem.""
Christian leaders in Jerusalem condemned the move, but added that they are appealing to Israeli authorities to reverse the decision. 

""Other people around the world are allowed to travel to Bethlehem. We think Gaza's Christians should have that right, too,"" said Wadie Abu Nassar, an adviser to local church leaders.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed the nomination of John Sullivan, President Donald Trump's pick to be Ambassador to Russia, at a time when ties between Washington and Moscow have been strained.
Sullivan, a lawyer who has served in previous Republican administrations before becoming deputy secretary of State in 2017, will replace Jon Huntsman, who resigned in August after two years in the post amid speculation that he will run for Utah governor.
Sullivan will be the top U.S. diplomat in Russia at a particularly challenging time in the bilateral relationship, which is strained over a number of disagreements on Ukraine, the Syrian civil war and Iran's influence in the Middle East, on top of U.S. allegations of Russian meddling in American elections.
Moscow denies the allegations.
Russia's blossoming ties with China is also a source of concern for U.S. policymakers.
Sullivan's confirmation also comes at a critical time in Trump's presidency, which has been shaken by an impeachment inquiry in which Democrats are accusing him of abusing his power by trying to force Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden.
Former Vice President Biden is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump next year.
On Thursday, U.S. lawmakers moved closer to impeaching Republican Trump, as members of a Democratic-led House of Representatives committee debated formal charges likely to be sent to the full House for a vote next week.
Sullivan's confirmation follows a visit earlier this week by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to Washington, where he met with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Trump.
The visit has revived allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election that resulted in Trump's upset victory, and whether it might do so again in 2020. Trump warned Moscow against meddling during the meeting with Lavrov, according to the White House and Pompeo.
U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
To replace Sullivan as the next deputy secretary of state, Trump in October nominated Stephen Biegun, the U.S. Special Representative for North Korea, a widely respected foreign policy veteran.
He enjoys broad support and is regarded as an acceptable acting secretary of state by senior current and former U.S. diplomats should Pompeo choose to step down to run for a Senate seat next year."

593,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 01:41PM ET</span>",Lebanese Christian party says it won't join government on Hariri's terms,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's largest Christian political party will not join a new government under the terms set by caretaker premier Saad al-Hariri, but will not obstruct the formation of a new cabinet, its leader said on Thursday.
The position of the Free Patriotic Movement led by Gebran Bassil could ease the way to the formation of a Hariri-led government. Much will depend on whether Bassil's ally, the powerful Shi'ite Hezbollah, will consent to its main Christian ally staying out of government.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, whose group is backed by Iran, is set to address the country on Friday. 
Lebanon is in urgent need of a new government to pull it from a deepening economic crisis that has shaken confidence in its banking system. Foreign donors have said they would offer support only after a cabinet able to enact reforms is in place.
The country has been mired in political gridlock since Hariri, the leading Sunni politician in a sectarian power-sharing system, resigned on Oct. 29 and made his return conditional on leading a cabinet comprised exclusively of specialists.
Those terms have proven to be a stumbling block with Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally Amal, as well as for President Michel Aoun, Bassil's father-in-law, all of whom have backed a mixed cabinet of technocrats and politicians.
Bassil's participation has been a particularly contentious sticking point in talks over the government with Aoun, who has insisted the Christian party leader be included in any new government led by Hariri, political sources say.
The crisis took an important twist on Sunday, when Lebanon's top Sunni cleric said he backed Hariri to be prime minister again, killing a tentative compromise on another candidate for a job reserved for a Sunni.
""If Prime Minister Hariri insists on the equation 'either me or nobody else'"" as prime minister, Bassil said, the Free Patriotic Movement is not interested in participating in such a government ""because its fate will be certain failure.""
Bassil appeared to leave the door open for his party to participate on different terms, saying he supported the formation of a government made up entirely of technocrats, including its prime minister.
""We are ready to sacrifice not with one ministerial seat, but with all of our seats, to save the country from collapse and chaos,"" he said.

Hariri on Thursday discussed with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank the possibility of technical assistance in drawing up a plan to rescue the economy after formation of the government.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, after losing the October election to Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said on Thursday he would resign so the country's largest opposition party could pick a new chief.
""I just informed my colleagues in the Conservative caucus that I will be resigning,"" Scheer said on the floor of the House of Commons. The decision is ""the best thing for the Conservative Party,"" he said.
He will stay on in his role until the party chooses a new leader, he said. There is a party convention scheduled for April, but it is still unclear whether that will be the setting for the party to elect a new chief.
Scheer has come under fire since the vote because he failed to defeat Trudeau, who polls showed was vulnerable after a series of scandals. When pictures of Trudeau in blackface emerged during the campaign, Scheer got a bump in the polls that faded before election day.
In recent weeks some Conservatives, particularly in Quebec, said it was time for him to go.
While Scheer won more votes than Trudeau in the election, his support was concentrated in Western provinces that have fewer seats than Quebec and Ontario, where Trudeau prevailed. Critics say his personal opposition to abortion and his refusal to participate in gay pride marches hurt him among Easterners.
Former Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay, whom some consider a potential future leader, compared Scheer's performance to a hockey player who failed to score ""on an open net"".
Jason Kenney, a former Conservative defense minister and now the head of Alberta's regional government, is considered one of the strongest candidates for leadership, but he has denied wanting the job.
Lawmaker Erin O'Toole, now the party's critic for foreign affairs, is another possibility.
""I felt it was time to put my family first,"" Scheer said when he announced his decision. It has been ""an incredible challenge"" for his five children, he said.
Trudeau thanked Scheer for his service and, as a father of three, said he understood the difficulties of balancing the job with a family.
Scheer's kids ""have made some significant sacrifices to see their father take on a leadership position,"" Trudeau said."

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi called on World Court judges on Thursday to dismiss an accusation of genocide against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, saying its own justice system should be given the chance to work first.
Gambia has accused Myanmar of violating the 1948 Genocide Convention in a military campaign that expelled more than 730,000 Rohingya from Myanmar and it has asked the International Court of Justice to order ""provisional measures"" to prevent more harm.
But Suu Kyi, who has denied genocide, said the U.N. court should not have jurisdiction.
""Myanmar requests the court to remove the case from its list,"" Suu Kyi said on the third and final day of hearings in The Hague. ""In the alternative (the court should) reject the request for provisional measures submitted by the Gambia.""
Presiding Judge Abdulqawi Yusuf said the 17-judge panel would render an order ""as soon as possible"", but gave no specific date.
Gambia insisted earlier that Myanmar could not be trusted to hold its soldiers accountable for alleged atrocities against its Rohingya minority, dismissing calls from Suu Kyi for the court to wait for the outcome of accountability efforts and local trials. 
Gambia lawyer Paul Reichler said Myanmar had not even tried during the hearings to deny most of the accusations of extreme violence against its military, known as the Tatmadaw, nor of the mass deportation of Rohingya following a 2017 crackdown.
Statements from Myanmar that it was taking action to prosecute soldiers accused of wrongdoing were not credible, he said.
""How can anyone possibly expect the Tatmadaw to hold itself accountable for genocidal acts against the Rohingya, when six of its top generals including the commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, have all been accused of genocide by the U.N. fact-finding mission and recommended for criminal prosecution,"" he said.
He was referring to the findings of U.N. investigators who in an August 2018 report said the Myanmar military had carried out killings and mass rape with ""genocidal intent"" in the 2017 operation. Gambia's legal team had outlined graphic testimony from their report at the first day of hearings on Tuesday.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar to Bangladesh after the military launched its crackdown. The U.N. investigators have said 10,000 people may have been killed.
LEADING THE DEFENCE
Suu Kyi, once championed in the West for her decades-long fight for democracy for Myanmar, told the court on Wednesday the military-led ""clearance operation"" in western Rakhine State was a counterterrorism response to coordinated Rohingya militant attacks against dozens of police stations in August 2017.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate argued Myanmar did investigate and prosecute soldiers and officers accused of crimes. She said that under those circumstances, the court should not intervene. 
""Steps that generate suspicion, sow doubts, or create resentment between communities who have just begun to build a fragile foundation of trust could undermine reconciliation,"" she said in closing remarks.
She added that even if there had been violations of humanitarian law during the conflict, they did not rise to the level of genocide.
Outside the ornate Peace Palace in The Hague that houses the court, protesters from both sides lined up on Thursday. When Suu Kyi returned to court for the final statements her supporters cheered loudly. 
They sang the national anthem and shouted ""Mother Suu, Be healthy"".
Maung Maung Aye, a well-known presenter in Myanmar, traveled from Yangon to support Suu Kyi.
""She always is for Myanmar so we are always ready to support her whatever she does,"" he told Reuters.
The International Court of Justice is the U.N.'s highest court. Its decisions are binding and not subject to appeal, though it has no means of enforcement and countries have occasionally ignored them or failed to fully adhere.
After the decision on provisional measures, the process may continue to a full case that could last years.
Rohingya Muslims in camps in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh were praying that the suit succeeds. 
Nurul Haq, 54, who said he fled to Bangladesh after his son was shot dead by the army, said he was fasting on Thursday.

""The speech Aung San Suu Kyi has given in the court is absolutely lies, all lies, all lies,"" he said. ""They tortured us so much... Only justice can heal our wounds.""

The United States formally withdrew from the landmark 1987 INF pact with Russia in August after determining that Moscow was violating the treaty, an accusation the Kremlin has denied.
The treaty, negotiated by then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles (500 to 5,500 km).
In a statement, the Pentagon said the test took place from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
""We are currently evaluating the results of the test,"" the statement said.
It was the second test by the Pentagon that would have not been allowed under the INF treaty.
In August, the Pentagon tested a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of more than 500 km (310 miles).
Moscow denies flouting the accord and has accused Washington of breaking the pact, allegations rejected by the United States.
The dispute is aggravating the worst U.S.-Russia friction since the Cold War ended in 1991. Some experts believe the treaty's collapse could undermine other arms control agreements and speed an erosion of the global system designed to block the spread of nuclear arms.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited Washington this week and met President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Lavrov renewed Moscow’s offer to extend the U.S.-Russia New START arms control treaty, while Trump and Pompeo stressed the need for a strategic dialogue that also included China.
The 2011 agreement, which requires both sides to cut their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, is scheduled to expire in February 2021 but can be extended for up to five years by mutual consent."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat should resign immediately to avoid risks of political interference with the investigation into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, the European Parliament told EU leaders on Thursday.
Muscat said on Dec. 1 he will resign in mid-January once a new leader of his Labour Party is picked. He took the step after his former chief of staff, Keith Schembri, was briefly arrested by police investigating the case.
Caruana Galizia's family say they suspect Muscat's government of a cover-up. Muscat denies any wrongdoing, as does Schembri, who resigned in late November.
In a letter delivered to leaders of EU countries as they met in Brussels on Thursday for a summit, the European Parliament urged the leaders to take a stance, saying a mission of lawmakers to the island had found the situation ""alarming"".
Muscat's ""delayed"" resignation ""constitutes a serious risk, real or perceived, the murder investigation and connected investigations will be compromised,"" the lawmakers wrote.
Lawmakers also want the European Commission to begin talks with Maltese authorities that could lead to sanctions over the rule of law, a draft resolution seen by Reuters said.
The text, which will be voted on Wednesday, warned against ""serious and persistent threats to the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights,"" in Malta, including on the independence of the police and judiciary. 
""SHAME ON YOU!""
Before the summit, dozens of people demonstrated in front of the Maltese permanent representation to the EU against Muscat's participation in the summit.
""Shame on you!"", they shouted holding an image of Muscat with the writing ""murderers"" on it. They plastered a wall in front of the headquarters of the European Commission with the same image.
The EU leaders should not accept Muscat at their meeting, Andrew Caruana Galizia, one of the sons of the murdered journalist, told Reuters on the sidelines of the protest. 
Muscat was photographed shaking hands with EU leaders at the summit later on Thursday.
The head of the centre-right grouping in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber of Germany, told journalists it was a ""huge scandal"" that Muscat was still in office. He called for his immediate resignation.
The political stability of the Mediterranean island has been rocked in recent weeks by the fallout from the murder of the anti-corruption journalist, who was blown up by a car bomb in 2017.
Two people were accused of planting the bomb but for nearly two years police were unable to say who hired them. Last month, a man given immunity from prosecution confessed to being the middleman.

Since then, a businessman was charged with plotting the crime. Muscat's government denied him a request for immunity in return for testimony he said would implicate senior officials.

Greece expelled the Libyan ambassador last week over the Nov. 27 accord establishing a sea corridor between Libya and Turkey and in areas where Greece considers it has maritime rights.
""We are here to stress that this specific agreement is rejected, it is invalid,"" said Aguila Saleh Issa, speaker of the Libyan House of Representatives.
""Those that signed it do not have any legal authority to do so, since the government itself was rejected. It did failed a confidence vote twice and has not been legally sworn in at the House of Representatives,"" Issa told reporters in Athens through an interpreter.
Issa is aligned to General Khalifa Haftar who controls the east of the country which opposes the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.
Turkey says the accord aims to protect its rights and is in line with international law. President Tayyip Erdogan said that the accord will allow Turkey and Libya to hold joint exploration operations in the region.
On Tuesday Athens said it had lodged objections with the United Nations, saying the accord violated international law.
Since 2014 Libya has had competing governments based in Tripoli and the east. Saleh's House of Representatives was Libya’s internationally recognized chamber at the time of a UN-backed deal in 2015 that led to the formation of the GNA, but the chamber has since fragmented."

The continent has the highest adolescent pregnancy rates in the world, and 18 African countries require pregnant girls to drop out of school.
Sierra Leone's ban was adopted in 2015 as teenage pregnancies rose during an Ebola epidemic. Critics say it has increased stigma for pregnant girls and sent thousands back in their studies.
The government has argued that allowing pregnant girls to attend school would tire them out, expose them to ridicule and encourage others to get pregnant.
Sierra Leone's education minister David Senghe declined to comment on whether the government would respect the ruling. Previous Sierra Leonean governments have ignored decisions by the ECOWAS court.
The government has created part-time centers where pregnant girls could study but the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) court in Nigeria ruled that this was not sufficient.
""The Court holds that the establishment of separate schools for pregnant girls with four taught subjects operating three days a week is discriminatory and a violation of the right to equal education,"" the ruling stated.
""This is a great victory and will set a strong precedent across Africa,"" said Judy Gitau, the head of women's rights group Equality Now, which brought the case. ""We're confident (the government) will make a decision to lift the ban.""
Patience Aminata, who was kicked out of school three years ago at the age of 17, said she hoped to return.
""If a girl gets pregnant, she has every right to further her education because it leads to success, not just for her, but for her whole family,"" she said. ""This ruling means it's not too late for me either."""

The three left the FPO over its disavowal of former leader Heinz-Christian Strache, who stepped down as vice chancellor in May after video footage showed him offering to fix government contracts at a dinner party in Ibiza, off the east coast of Spain, with a woman posing as a Russian oligarch's niece.
The scandal prompted the collapse of the ruling coalition between the FPO and conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz and contributed to a 10-point plunge in support for the FPO in September's parliamentary election.
Thursday's founding of a new political group in Vienna's assembly, the Alliance for Austria (DAO), is also widely seen as paving the way for an attempted political comeback by Strache in his hometown, a Social Democratic stronghold where city council elections are due to be held next autumn.
""The FPO has become an anti-Strache party that we say we are no longer prepared to represent,"" one of the three Vienna lawmakers, Karl Baron, told a news conference announcing the DAO's launch.
Although only a group within the local assembly, the DAO already has a website http://www.daö.at, fuelling suspicion that it will become a fully fledged party led by Strache. Baron said he hoped Strache would join and lead it in Vienna's next election.
The FPO's Vienna leadership is considering expelling Strache in the wake of the Ibiza scandal and more recent allegations that he improperly claimed excessive expenses from the party, but a decision has not formally been reached.
Thursday's move, however, only exacerbated tensions between Strache and the remaining leadership of a party he led for 14 years. Like other far-right parties in Europe, the FPO thrived on public fears about Europe's migration crisis.
An outright party split would be a fresh blow after the Ibiza scandal.
The Austrian anti-corruption prosecutors' office is investigating Strache on suspicion of fraud in relation to the Ibiza video.
Strache denies wrongdoing.
Thursday's announcement prompted comparisons with 2005, when the FPO's longtime leader, Joerg Haider, left to found his own party, Alliance Future Austria.
""Alliance Future Ibiza has been founded and will also have to shoulder all responsibility for subsequent events,"" FPO leader Norbert Hofer said on Twitter."

There were no survivors, Arturo Merino, head of Chile's air force, told reporters.
The aircraft, which was heading to a base in Antarctica, disappeared shortly after taking off late on Monday from the southern city of Punta Arenas in Chilean Patagonia. It carried 21 passengers and 17 crew members.
""The condition of the remains we discovered make it practically impossible that anyone could have survived the airplane accident,"" Merino said.
Extreme weather conditions, including low clouds, strong winds and massive, rolling ocean swells initially complicated search efforts following the plane's disappearance.
The first pieces of debris from the plane were discovered by Chilean air force officials late on Wednesday. A Brazilian ship sailing in the region also found pieces of the plane.
The air force's Merino said authorities would immediately conduct forensic analyses on the remains to confirm their origin. 
Chile's Legal Medical Service, the state coroner, had also sent a team to Punta Arenas to analyze the blood of family members earlier on Thursday.
The plane crashed over the Drake Sea, a vast untouched ocean wilderness off the southernmost edge of the South American continent that plunges to 3,500 meters (11,500 feet).

Marin took office on Tuesday after the Centre Party withdrew support from Social Democrat leader Antti Rinne, forcing him to step down as prime minister. Marin became the world's youngest national leader, and all five leaders of the parties in her coalition are women, four of them under 35.
""I haven't concentrated that much on the media coverage of the change of government or my prime ministership. I have concentrated on the fact that we have a lot of work to do,"" Marin told reporters on Thursday as she arrived for two days of European Union summit talks in Brussels.
She has been congratulated by female political leaders from around the world, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen - who last month became the first female leader of the EU executive - and Hillary Clinton.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday expelled two German diplomats in what it called a standard diplomatic response to a similar move by Germany last week and said it hoped a dispute over the killing of a Georgian citizen in Berlin would not damage ties further.
Berlin announced the expulsion of two Russian diplomats last week over what it said was Moscow's refusal to cooperate in the investigation of a murder in which German prosecutors suspect Russian or Chechen involvement. The Russian government has denied any connection with the killing. 
Russia's Foreign Ministry on Thursday summoned the German ambassador in Moscow to issue Berlin a formal protest over the expulsions and gave two German diplomats seven days to leave the country, it said in a statement.
""These measures were unavoidable after two of our diplomats were expelled. We consider the move by Berlin to be absolutely unfounded,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 
""We expect and hope that this will not become a negative factor for the further development and broadening of our constructive dialogue,"" he told reporters on a conference call. 
Tensions between Russia and Western countries including Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian gas and oil, have resurged since the poisoning last year of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter on British soil.
Germany traditionally has close business ties with Russia and the diplomatic row came as Russia is building a major natural gas pipeline to Germany, Nord Stream 2, despite U.S. opposition. 
Germany's Foreign Ministry said it regretted the move by Russia to expel the German diplomats. 
""It sends the wrong signal and is unjustified,"" it said.
Georgian citizen Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in Berlin in August as he was heading to a mosque.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week Khangoshvili himself was a killer who had carried out bloody acts on Russian soil and that Moscow's requests for his extradition had not been heeded. 
Germany contradicted that on Wednesday, saying it was not aware of any extradition requests made by Moscow.
On Thursday, the Kremlin insisted it had sought Khangoshvili's extradition. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Khangoshvili had been sought by the police and was listed in Russia's official database for wanted criminals.
""There were requests. The man took part in acts of terrorism and mass murder,"" Peskov said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian television channel has abruptly stopped airing the sitcom that launched the political career of Ukraine's president, after viewers noticed it had edited out an obscene joke about Vladimir Putin from the first episode.
The TNT channel, part of the media arm of Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), raised eyebrows when it announced it would air ""Servant of the People"", whose star Volodymyr Zelenskiy, playing a schoolteacher who becomes president, went on to win Ukraine's presidency in real life this year.
TNT began airing the series on Wednesday, but the Russian-language service of the BBC noted it had edited out a play on words about Putin and an expensive make of Swiss watch, Hublot, which sounds like an obscenity in Russian.
TNT had been scheduled to continue airing the show on Thursday and Friday, but those listings have been replaced, the Vedomosti business daily reported. Listings now show it will run a hospital sitcom and a Russian comedy series.
TNT did not respond to a request to comment about the alleged censorship. It denied it had ever planned to continue running the show and said it had only begun doing so for the first few episodes as part of a marketing ploy for a pay-to-view platform where it said the series would still be available.
""It was a marketing play,"" Gazprom Media's general director Dmitry Chernyshenko told reporters.
Putin and Zelenskiy met for the first time this week at a summit in Paris aimed at finding ways to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting against government forces."
608,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 09:37AM ET</span>",Former Spanish soccer players sentenced to prison for raping teenager,"MADRID (Reuters) - Three former Spanish soccer players were each sentenced on Thursday to 38 years in prison for gang raping a minor in 2017, the latest high-profile sexual violence case in Spain.
The three men, who at the time played for fourth division club Arandina FC, knew the victim was underage when they raped her in their apartment in Aranda de Duero in northcentral Spain, the judge said.
The issue of sexual violence has been thrust in the spotlight in Spain in the wake of several trials, including the so-called Wolf Pack case in which five men were sentenced for raping a teenage girl during Pamplona's annual bull-running festival.
At issue in the Wolf Pack trial, as well as a string of others, was the fact that Spanish law currently does not legally recognize rape unless physical violence or intimidation is employed. The Socialist government has appointed a panel to review relevant parts of the penal code.
In the sentencing of the soccer players, the judge said the girl, who was less than 16-years-old at the time, was unable to react to the assault due to the disparity in age and physical strength between her and the attackers.
The attack took place with the lights off, taking the victim by surprise and creating an atmosphere of intimidation, the judge added.
Although the victim initially told friends and relatives on social networks that she was not raped, the court said it accepted her subsequent statement that she did not submit voluntarily to the men.
The three men were convicted for rape and for helping the other two take part.
Olga Navarro, the players' lawyer, called the sentence ""embarrassing"" and said the court was imprisoning three innocent young men, who have denied any wrongdoing.
The men insist the girl was lying.
""We're not rapists. We were naive and they're trying to screw up our lives,"" one of the men, Carlos Cuadrado, said after the sentence.
Another, Victor Rodriguez, said the sentence was the result of social and media pressure.
The sentence can be appealed."

Mario Rozas, director-general of Chile's Carabineros police force, said the service had launched internal investigations into 856 cases of alleged abuses. He said he expected charges to be filed in many of them.
Nearly two months of protests over inequality have rocked Chile, leaving at least 26 dead, thousands injured and billions of dollars of damage in the once-stable South American nation.
International rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have alleged repeated human rights abuses during rallies.
The Chilean Ophthalmological Society has said more than 200 people suffered severe eye trauma in the demonstrations, mostly due to police rubber bullets.
Rozas said the police force planned to create a special service dedicated exclusively to maintaining ""public order"" during future protests and rallies, with a focus on protecting human rights.
The police also plan to review the use of large- armored trucks known as ""guanacos,"" which for weeks have hosed protesters with water cannons, and also, vehicles known as ""zorrillos,"" which spray tear gas.
A 15-year old girl was hit by a tear gas cannister this week during a protest, prompting widespread outrage in Santiago.
Protests and more violent riots and looting have nonetheless dropped sharply in recent days. Rozas said 4.6 million people had participated in 2,500 rallies across the country over more than 50 days."

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates has lobbied several European countries to ease restrictions on weapons exports following a series of strikes in the Gulf this year, according to three Western diplomats and two other people with knowledge of the discussions.
Emirati officials have in the discussions with European counterparts stressed the Gulf state’s need to defend itself while highlighting the UAE's drawdown of troops in Yemen, the five people with knowledge of the discussions said. The restrictions had been imposed because of concerns that weapons could be used in the conflict in Yemen between a Saudi-led military coalition, that includes the UAE, and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. 
The lobbying efforts around UAE’s defenses, details of which the Gulf state keeps closely guarded on grounds of national security, have resulted in some success - notably in Germany.
Berlin in October told officials involved in the process that it had granted an export license for German-made generators used to power U.S. Patriot batteries protecting UAE cities and airports, two of the people said.
The push by Emirati officials began after tanker attacks off the Gulf state’s coast this summer and intensified following an assault on oil plants in neighboring Saudi Arabia in mid-September, according to the five people. Washington has blamed the attacks on the tankers and the Saudi oil plants on Iran.
Tehran has repeatedly publicly denied any involvement in the attacks.
The UAE government’s media office and foreign ministry did not respond requests for comment. The UAE began withdrawing troops in June and a small number remain in strategic locations.
The UAE has also tightened security at home. Emirati authorities have expanded coastguard patrols and are monitoring ships and their documentation more carefully, said two UAE-based sources.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have come under harsh criticism in the West over Yemen, where the conflict has resulted in the death of tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine. That includes from Germany, which in March 2018 had imposed a ban on exporting weapons to parties directly involved in the Yemen war.
Leading the Emirati effort with Germany was Sultan al-Jaber, the UAE’s special envoy for Germany and chief executive of state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), according to the five people with knowledge of the discussions. Jaber and other UAE officials have raised concerns with German officials about the ban over the course of at least five meetings in Berlin and Abu Dhabi since May, said the five people. 
""The moment the UAE pulled out of Yemen it was a game-changer"" for the German government, said a person who had been briefed by German and UAE officials on the negotiations. 
Germany is pleased with UAE's retreat from Yemen and also views the Gulf state as playing a more constructive role in Libya, several German government officials said.
The German chancellor's office referred questions to the economy ministry. ""The government ... makes choices on permits for arms exports on a case-by-case basis and in light of the situation after careful assessments that take into account foreign policy and security considerations,"" the economy ministry said in a statement.
Reuters didn’t receive responses to questions sent to Jaber via the UAE government media office.
Swedish defense firm Saab AB (ST:SAABb) pressed Stockholm on Abu Dhabi’s behalf to secure licenses for GlobalEye surveillance jets, equipped with a multi-sensor early warning system, according to another diplomat.
The diplomat said Saab sought the licenses, which would enable them to export two additional jets, after Sweden in January tightened criteria for new export licenses to countries involved in the Yemen war. The tighter criteria meant licenses to sell weapons to the UAE would be more closely scrutinized by the Inspectorate of Strategic Products (ISP), the government agency responsible for arms exports.
Saab, in a Nov. 19 press release, described the UAE’s intention to purchase two new surveillance jets as an “amendment” to a previous contract that pre-dated the January agreement. It said the new purchases would be worth $1 billion.
Saab’s president and chief executive, Micael Johansson, told Reuters that the company had secured a license this autumn to export the two surveillance jets to UAE, with the first delivery of the five due early next year.
It was unclear what prompted the government to award the licenses. ""I don't know exactly how Swedish authorities and politicians assessed that factor but of course it helps if the (Yemen) conflict is going in the right direction,"" said Johansson, speaking on the side lines of the Dubai Airshow on Nov 19.
The Swedish government declined to comment. An ISP spokesman declined to comment on whether a license had been granted, citing secrecy rules. Six of the members of Sweden’s export control council contacted by Reuters declined to comment.
The UAE has been unsuccessful in Norway, where it has been trying to buy small drones but is prevented by an export ban in place since January 2018, according to one of the five people with knowledge of the discussions.
The UAE has had in-person discussions with Norwegian officials on several occasions since May, citing their changed policy on Yemen, but has not been able to repeat the success they had with Germany, the person said.

Norway didn’t comment on discussions with the UAE. In a statement, State Secretary Audun Halvorsen said: “In December 2017, Norway decided to suspend all valid export licenses for category A material (weapons and ammunition) to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). New export licenses for category A material to the UAE will not be granted. The threshold for denying B-material and dual-use goods for military use to countries taking part in military operations in Yemen has also been lowered further.”

YANGON (Reuters) - Crowds have gathered for the past three evenings in a small park in downtown Myanmar's capital Yangon to hear accusations of genocide delivered thousands of miles away at the United Nation's top court in The Hague.
Truck drivers, cyclists, government staff, monks and nuns, clustered round big screens outside city hall to watch lawyers recount harrowing tales of Rohingya Muslim refugees who survived a 2017 military crackdown that drove 730,000 into Bangladesh. Myanmar's legal team argues that campaign was not genocide.
A dozen who spoke to Reuters voiced unwavering support for leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is leading a team of lawyers to the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands to defend the Myanmar government and military.
""I've come here every day to watch the court hearing,"" said U Chaw, a 62-year-old municipal staffer dressed in a blue uniform as he watched lawyers speak on behalf of The Gambia, the African country which brought charges last month.
The testimony has at times been graphic. On Tuesday, Gambia's legal team outlined testimony of alleged bloody excesses by soldiers, including mass killings, rape, and the burning of hundreds of villages. U.N. investigators estimated 10,000 people may have been killed.
On Wednesday, they displayed images of the dead bodies of 10 Rohingya killed in the village of Inn Din.
As the pictures appeared, U Chaw said he had never seen them. Nevertheless, he said, he believed foreign media funded by Islamic groups was spreading false information.
""I am really glad that Daw Suu went there and took a chance to say the truth to the world,"" he said.
REVERED, CRITICIZED
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate's shock decision to attend the hearings in person has dealt a further blow to her tarnished international reputation.
Suu Kyi was long feted internationally as a champion of human rights and democracy, and was a high-profile political prisoner during 15 years of house arrest for her opposition to Myanmar's then ruling military junta.
But her stance on the Rohingya issue has seen her stripped of many awards, calls for the Nobel committee to revoke her peace prize, and strong criticism from former celebrity supporters and other organizations.
At home however, Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmar's founding father Aung San, is still revered by many.
The proceedings in the Hague have galvanized supporters, who have staged rallies across the country chanting ""Stand with Suu Kyi"" and waving flags.
On Wednesday, she argued the tribunal, known as the World Court, should not have jurisdiction. She said even if there had been violations of humanitarian law during what she described as an ""internal conflict"", they did not rise to the level of genocide and are not covered by the Convention.
The following morning, front pages of all the major newspapers on Thursday featured her speech. One ran a full-page image of her with the words ""Stand with Suu Kyi"".
The Irrawaddy, a magazine once synonymous with pro-democracy dissidents, published an editorial titled ""Political Correctness and the Genocide Case Against Myanmar"", arguing that it has become ""fashionable"" to criticize Suu Kyi.
A cartoon that went viral on social media showed the politician in 1989, at the start of her defiance against the military junta, facing rifles held by soldiers.
Beneath was an image of her in 2019, facing representations of the media wielding a camera like a gun and a lawyer with a long knife.
In the park on Thursday, Kyaw Htike, a truck driver, eating biscuits as he watched the hearing, said he believed the true number of people the military killed in Rakhine was small.
He had driven through the western region, which borders Bangladesh, he said. Echoing popular tropes about the Rohingya minority, he said they took advantage of Buddhist women.
Blaming them for their own plight, he said: ""There were too many cruel things they did. Mother Suu is suffering now in the international court."""

Muhammed Yusoff Rawther, who worked at a charity founded by Anwar, had accused the former deputy premier of trying to force him to have sex in September 2018.
Anwar has denied the charge, describing it as ""politics at its worst"".
Anwar spent nearly a decade in jail on two separate counts of sodomy and for corruption, charges that he and his supporters maintain were aimed at ending his political career. He was first jailed in 1999.
Anwar spent an hour at police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to provide his account of the allegations, he said in a statement.
""Throughout the process, I provided the facts and full cooperation to the police,"" he said.
Following the interview, police officials accompanied Anwar and his lawyer to his home to complete their investigations, he said.
Malaysian police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Same-sex acts are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia and carry penalties of up to 20 years in jail.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad promised to hand over power to Anwar in spite of the latest allegations against him.
Anwar was first jailed during Mahathir's first 1981-2003 tenure as premier. The pair joined forces to lead the opposition to an unexpected election victory last year."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A painting depicting Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata naked but for high heels and a pink sombrero, astride an aroused white horse, has sparked controversy in socially conservative Mexico, prompting protests that briefly flared into violence.
Zapata is widely considered a national hero and especially revered in rural Mexico. He helped sweep away the hacienda system in the early 20th century, replacing it with small holdings and land collectives.
The uproar over the painting has turned a spotlight on issues of freedom of expression and tolerance in Mexico.
""This issue of the painting of Emiliano Zapata has generated controversy,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday. ""I am asking the culture ministry to address this issue so that mediation is sought.""
Protesters who described themselves as part of the National Union of Agricultural Workers burst into the fine arts museum in Mexico City on Tuesday, demanding that the painting be taken down and burned. The demonstration soon turned violent.
Two men were physically attacked ""at the hands of people who hurled homophobic insults,"" the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature (INBAL) said, adding that it gave them ""necessary medical attention and the corresponding legal support.""
Members of the media were also attacked.
Mexico City is home to the country's most visible gay community and couples freely express affection in many parts of the capital, which has equal marriage legislation, as do some 19 of the 31 states.
Fabian Chairez, the artist who painted the Zapata portrait, said, ""I use these elements like the sombrero and horse and create a proposal that shows other realities, other ways of representing masculinity.""
Despite progress toward marriage equality, outside the capital attitudes differ sharply, and there is often impunity toward discrimination, while reports of violence against homosexuals are common.
""Of course it's fine if they don't like the painting, they can criticize the exhibition, but to seek to censor freedom of expression, that's different,"" said Luis Vargas Santiago, curator of the exhibit 'Emiliano Zapata after Zapata'.
Eliseo Añorve, an elderly man who was sitting in front of the museum, said Zapata ""was a tough figure, a manly figure that took up arms to defend the peasantry and the whole republic ... he is a hero of our revolution and a respectable leader who doesn't deserve to be ridiculed."""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - History has marched on since they arrived in the middle of the last century, seeking refuge for what they thought would be a few weeks, but staying for a lifetime.
Around them the Middle East lurched from conflict to civil war to peace and back again. But for Palestinian refugees in these camps, there has been little movement over decades - only their memories and hopes can travel freely back to lost lands.
Visited by photographers decades apart, time seems to have passed at a different speed in many of the Palestinian refugee camps scattered across Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.
Change there has been, but limited in its ambition. Canvas tents in 1948 Beirut grew up to be cinder block homes. Beaches evolved into sunless alleyways.
And young women balancing clay water pots on their heads in 1950s Gaza became the grandmothers of a generation who today have taps in their homes but still haul bottled water home because it is filtered, and so safer to drink.
A key presence in these lives is UNRWA, the United Nations agency which provides services and protection to 5.5 million Palestinian refugees. Around a third – more than 1.5 million - live in 58 registered camps.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East – its full name - was created by the U.N. General Assembly 70 years ago to deal with the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had been driven from their homes or fled the conflict surrounding the birth of the modern state of Israel in 1948.
One of the descendants of that exodus - Najah Abu Reyala - has lived all her life in Beach Camp, the third largest of eight refugee camps in coastal Gaza.
Now 61, she remembers the rudimentary conditions during her youth in the camp, where the population has grown from 23,000 to more than 85,000.
""Streets were not paved, they were sandy and dusty,"" she recalls. But although the passing of the years brought more services, it also brought more tension, divisions and despair.
""Maybe they put electricity and water inside the houses, but things are far worse than they used to be,” she said. “Back then, we were more closely knit, we were more united.”
Abu Reyala and other refugees want the right to return to their families’ former lands in pre-1948 Palestine, lands which now lie inside Israel. Israel has rejected any such right of return as a demographic threat to its Jewish majority.
And many Israelis regard UNRWA - by far the largest humanitarian organization handling Palestinian refugees - with suspicion.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that UNRWA’s longevity had served to perpetuate, not solve, the refugee problem. “It is time (for) UNRWA (to) be dismantled,"" he said in 2017, urging the U.N. to ""re-examine” its existence.
Just such a re-examination is due in the coming days, with the U.N. General Assembly to vote on renewing UNRWA's mandate.
Amid financial crisis and political uncertainty, Palestinian leaders warned of unrest if services were to vanish.
But in November 170 countries voted in committee for UNRWA's mandate renewal ahead of the main assembly. Only two - Israel and the United States - voted against.
Although nothing is certain in Middle East politics, such an overwhelming majority is unlikely to be overturned in the final vote, the agency's supporters say, with no easy alternative available.
“UNRWA’S detractors want a solution to the refugee problem without a political agreement,” said Elizabeth Campbell, an UNRWA official in Washington.
“And that’s a very difficult thing to achieve.”"

GENEVA (Reuters) - Famine threatens the lives of up to 5.5 million people in South Sudan, where droughts and flooding have destroyed crops and livestock, compounding ""intense political instability"", the United Nations warned on Thursday.
The U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) said it needed $270 million urgently to provide food to hungry South Sudanese in the first half of 2020 and avert mass starvation in the world's youngest country.
""Every factor is in place for there to be famine in 2020 unless we take immediate action to expand our deliveries in areas affected by floods and other areas affected by food loss,"" Matthew Hollingworth, WFP country director, told Reuters.
""We need to pre-position food around the country in the next two to three months,"" he said, noting that road access to many remote communities would be impossible after the rainy season sets in.
The government declared a state of emergency in late October in Bahr El Ghazal, Greater Upper Nile and Greater Equatoria after months of flooding, WFP said in a statement.
Nearly 1 million people are directly affected by the floods and the waters have not receded in many places, it said.
""The scale of the loss from the harvest is enormous,"" Hollingworth said, speaking by telephone from Juba.
Fields with 73,000 tonnes of sorghum, millet and corn have been lost as well as tens of thousands of cattle, chickens and goats on which families depended for survival, he said.
Acute malnutrition rates in children under the age of five have risen from 13% in 2018 to 16% this year, Hollingworth said, adding: ""They have gone above the global emergency threshold of 15%.""
Water-borne diseases are spreading, although no cholera has been detected, he said.
""It can only get worse because of the situation and environment people are living in,"" he said.
Civil war broke out in oil-producing South Sudan in 2013, less than two years after the country gained independence from Sudan following decades of war. The conflict that has killed an estimated 400,000 people and forced millions from their homes.
Inter-communal fighting still occurs in pockets hit by the flooding, Hollingworth said.
""Hunger and desperation bring instability when resources are stretched to the extent that makes an already unstable situation much worse. It is a wake-up call for us all,"" he said."
617,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 07:36AM ET</span>",Special Report: Egypt’s strongman extends crackdown to a new foe - soap operas,"By Reuters staff
CAIRO (Reuters) - Gamal el Adl's company is one of the most popular television producers in the Middle East. Its gritty soap operas, touching on drug addiction amongst the middle classes, sexual abuse and life in a women's prison, have been hits on TV in Egypt and across the Arab world.
Until, that is, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi unleashed a new wave of censorship.
In the past three years, the former general has turned the screws on the entertainment and news industries. A new regulatory agency is overseeing output and censoring content. Soap operas, it insists, must contain no sex scenes, no blasphemy, no politics. Police and other authority figures should be presented in a positive light.
El Adl says he thought he could manage by steering clear of the biggest taboos. But when he heard that police had raided the film set of a rival early this year because it lacked a necessary permit, he revised his view. He immediately halted work on the two soaps he was filming, fearing he too would run into trouble for not having a permit.
He couldn't operate in this environment, he said. ""There was just one entity, one eye, one taste, one vision.""
It is President Sisi's vision – one of heroism and patriotic virtue. And it is being pursued with innovative techniques.
In interviews, program makers, and news media executives described how the Sisi administration has clamped down with controls that they say are stricter than those that existed under Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt with a hard grip until being overthrown in 2011. Many details of the new methods are reported here for the first time.
They include the withholding of filming permits and a list of banned topics for soaps that program makers must agree to. The government has also created two WhatsApp groups that instruct news media what to report, and has placed censors at TV stations to oversee output.
The government is also getting deeper into the entertainment business itself. Since 2017, a new firm called United Group for Media Services has taken control of news outlets, TV production companies and channels - in all, at least 14 so far - giving it unrivalled influence over the TV schedule. United Group has enthusiastically enforced government censorship rules.
A dozen industry and government sources told Reuters that United Group for Media Services was set up by the state. Two of its four board members have links to Egyptian General Intelligence, and one of the company's units was previously headed by the intelligence chief, Reuters found.
Actors critical of the government say they fear arrest. Program makers say the dramas they make have become bland like an insipid soup. Prime time talk show hosts who don't fully toe the government line are fired or side-lined. One producer said the authorities have blocked him from working in TV or cinema, without giving a reason.
Khaled Youssef, a member of the Egyptian parliament and a prominent film director, said the government is ""interfering in the content of drama"" and had pushed out private production firms to exert control. A Sisi critic, Youssef now lives in Paris in voluntary exile. ""They don't want people to think,"" he said.
Sisi's clampdown on entertainment and news comes as his government battles Islamist extremists who have launched deadly attacks against tourists, churches and on the streets of Cairo.
The president's hold on the media is typical of many authoritarian governments, from China to Russia. Still, the clampdown in Cairo is notable because of its implications outside Egypt. The nation of 100 million is not only the Arab world's most populous country, it is home to its biggest film industry by far.
Censorship is more oppressive now than under Hosni Mubarak's autocratic rule, program makers say. In the final decade of the Mubarak regime, there were productions that grappled with police brutality and homosexuality. Where Mubarak's censors would approve a soap after sampling just a few episodes, Sisi's insist on watching the entire series of 30 shows or more.
An editor at a leading newspaper told Reuters that even under Mubarak, publishers only faced intimidation if articles named intelligence or military officers. Now, he said, the chief of the General Intelligence Service, Abbas Kamel, and his officers have firm and direct influence over what the media report. So much, he said, that journalists have begun calling them ""Egypt's editors in chief.""
The Egyptian government, intelligence agency and media regulator didn't respond to detailed questions for this article. Reuters' calls to the United Group for Media Services went unanswered.
SOURING RELATIONSHIP
Sisi's presidency began on a wave of goodwill in 2014 after he led the military in toppling President Mohammed Mursi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader who was democratically elected but deeply unpopular by the time of his removal.
Sisi exhorted the media to back his government. Announcing plans to dig a second Suez Canal, a patriotic project on a vast scale, Sisi urged the media to ""help us in our fight"" to unify Egypt. ""It's a very big fight,"" he declared. Delivering a speech to honor the country's police a year later, he called on the entertainment industry to make dramas and movies that ""give people hope and improve our values and ethics.""
By 2016 Sisi's relationship with the media was deteriorating. In April of that year, the president ceded two islands in a strategic part of the Red Sea to his ally Saudi Arabia, leading to protests. When some newspapers joined the outcry, security forces raided the Cairo office of an organization that represents journalists. Two reporters critical of the government were arrested and charged with spreading false news. It was the beginning of a wider crackdown.
Then, in 2017, Sisi established the Supreme Council for Media Regulation to oversee all news and entertainment. Its drama committee was tasked with monitoring all soap operas on Egyptian television. The council's head was picked by the president.
The committee has taken a keen interest in moral issues.
In one report, issued this year, it criticized some soaps for their depiction of characters smoking, swearing and ""insulting the Arabic language"" by using English words. In a one-week period during the holy month of Ramadan, when Egyptian families traditionally come together in the evening to enjoy their favorite dramas, the committee recorded 948 breaches of its code. One series, ""Kingdom of the Gypsies,"" notched up 105 violations for vulgar language, violence, sexual innuendo and ""disrespecting"" the Arabic language. Reuters couldn't determine whether the program or its creators faced any sanction.
""LIMITED COVERAGE""
News media are under even greater scrutiny. Hundreds of news websites and blogs have been blocked in recent years and a media law passed in 2018 gives the state powers to block social media accounts and punish journalists for publishing what it considers to be false news.
The security agencies created two WhatsApp groups to relay instructions to news organizations about how to cover events. Reuters reviewed messages in both groups. One is called ""Editors"" and run by the General Intelligence. The second is run by the Ministry of the Interior. Neither the ministry nor the intelligence agency responded to Reuters' request for comment about the WhatsApp groups.
When 20 people were killed in an explosion outside a Cairo cancer hospital in April this year, an intelligence official wrote: ""I don't want expansion of the coverage of the cancer center incident...limited coverage."" Egyptian media obliged and reporting was limited.
In May, a blast near Cairo's Grand Egyptian Museum injured at least 12 South African tourists. The WhatsApp instruction was: ""Please wait for the Ministry of Interior statement and don't add anything to it."" Reuters reviewed the reports carried by four news outlets and found that they were almost identical.
WhatsApp orders also flowed in September, when a former actor called for protests against Sisi in a series of YouTube videos. Mohamed Ali, who lives in Spain, accused Sisi and Egypt's military of corruption, claims that Sisi dismissed as ""lies and slander.""
""Please don't publish news reports about Mohammed Ali,"" said one WhatsApp message. Obediently, media reviewed by Reuters didn't cover the videos, which went viral on social media, until Sisi mentioned them in a speech two weeks later. Contacted by Reuters, Ali declined to comment.
""RUN BY INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS""
For staff at TV network DMC, also controlled by United Group for Media Services, the state is intrusive. Before the station can broadcast its news, sports and entertainment programs, its editors need a green light from the plain-clothed intelligence officers who are a constant presence in DMC's studios, one current and one former employee told Reuters.
The former employee said the network was effectively ""run by intelligence officers"" who attended executive meetings. Some senior appointments were made by Kamel, chief of the General Intelligence Service, who also set some salaries. A producer who still works at DMC said an intelligence officer sometimes sat in the control room to see what was going on at the channel. Reuters couldn't reach company management for comment and Kamel, contacted via the Egyptian authorities, didn't respond.
""The damage that has been done to the Egyptian media is unbelievable, unprecedented,"" said Hisham Kassem, a former newspaper publisher and political activist. ""It’s easily the worst media disaster in the history of Egypt. They don't care about quality – if you disagree, they'll sack you.""
Central to the state's tightening grip on Egypt's entertainment industry is a company called United Group for Media Services. Established in 2017, the firm has taken over at least six newspapers and news websites, four TV networks encompassing 14 channels, four radio stations and several theaters and cinemas. Eight people in the media industry who have done business with United Group for Media Services said the company was set up by the state. As it has expanded, United Group has come to dominate the TV schedules and determine which programs make it to air. It has strictly enforced government censorship.
Reuters reviewed documents filed by United Group for Media Services with the authorities since its registration. These documents didn't disclose the ownership of the company, but they did identify its four board members.
Two intelligence sources told Reuters that two members of the board had links to the intelligence service. One of them, Yaser Ahmed Saber Ahmed Seliem, was previously an intelligence officer. Another document showed that intelligence chief Kamel himself previously sat on the board of a TV firm called D-Media that is now part of United Group. Seliem and Kamel, contacted via the Egyptian authorities, didn't respond to a request for comment.
For program makers like el Adl, the dominance of one big buyer, United Group for Media Services, and the emergence of a strict new regulator made creating and selling dramas increasingly difficult. At the end of last year he waited in vain for his usual filming permit. With time running short, he decided to start work on two soaps, assuming the permit would arrive soon and, if his scripts avoided the taboos of sex and politics, he wouldn't get into trouble.
""I thought I'd make the programs anyway and if the local channels didn't buy them then I could sell them outside Egypt,"" he explained. But three episodes into filming, police raided the set of a now defunct rival production company. Two police cars pulled up at the shoot and told the crew to stop filming because they didn't have a license, three crew members and a security source said. The crew complied. El Adl decided to stop filming too in order to stay out of trouble.
El Adl and some other program makers say that, at first, they supported the state's intervention in the TV market on economic grounds. Many of Egypt's television channels were unprofitable, partly because they were trying to outbid one another for content. The cost of the soaps made by el Adl and others were rising and actors' wages were spiraling. El Adl was among those calling for price regulation, he said. The state's entry into the business has put a lid on wages but the intervention has gone too far. The authorities are now ""the ones who decide whether you work or not.""
He is hopeful that 2020 will be a better year. He expects to pick up filming his two soaps, provided he stays within the new budget limits and works within the new system. ""We figured out that the authorities were making a framework for people to follow,"" he said.
Another director of movies and soaps, who declined to be identified, said he believes Sisi is trying ""to control the narrative."" The director said he'd had to sign a document pledging not to include any scenes in his dramas that ""insulted"" the police. He was told that if there was a shootout, officers mustn't be seen to die because this would be bad for the force's morale. The director fell into line.
The president's efforts risk backfiring, however, this director said. Viewers are increasingly turning to channels operated by Egyptians outside the country, offering shows with alternative views or less censorship, such as Mekameleen and al-Sharq, both based in Turkey. The channels didn’t respond to a request for comment.
TABOOS
Each year, during the holy month of Ramadan, millions of Egyptian families gather in the evening to watch their favorite soaps. But this year there was a difference.
Government officials held a meeting with a group of trusted writers and directors, according to two sources who were briefed on the conversation that took place. The officials set out the themes and ideas they wanted to see in TV soaps, and those they didn't. They told the assembled writers and directors that dramas shouldn't show police officers or members of the security services in a negative light, cheating on their wives, for instance.
Many Egyptians complain that Sisi is depriving them even of the right to have fun. Before the president came to power, the Ramadan audience could choose from 40 or more dramas exploring social issues, family relationships, mysteries and crime. The soaps were a cherished part of the holy month, when millions of Egyptians would spend the evenings glued to their television sets.
But during this year's Ramadan, which fell in May, there were only 25 soaps, 15 of them made by a firm called Synergy, which is part of the United Group for Media Services. Many of the shows showed police officers heroically fighting ""evil forces"" – a term Sisi uses to describe opposition figures and Islamist militants.
One, called Kalabsh, told the story of a special forces officer who fights terrorists and corruption.
Shows like this, says award-winning actor Amr Waked, underscore how Egypt's entertainment industry is withering. Waked reached a global audience when he appeared alongside George Clooney in Syriana, a 2005 thriller.
""It's as if the soaps are written by a police officer,"" Waked said.
Waked was last in an Egyptian soap in 2017, and he now lives in self-imposed exile in Spain. In 2018, a military court sentenced him in absentia to eight years in prison for spreading false news and insulting state institutions. Waked believes he was targeted because of his pro-democracy tweets. The Egyptian government didn’t respond to a request for comment about Waked’s case.
""Throughout my entire life, I have never seen Egypt worse than this,"" Waked said."
618,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 07:13AM ET</span>",Italy's Salvini investigated over use of state flights,"ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's right-wing League party, has been placed under criminal investigation by Rome prosecutors over suspicions he improperly used state flights, a judicial source close to the investigation said.
The probe into possible abuse of office concerns 35 plane and helicopter flights Salvini took when he was interior minister in the previous government which he brought down in August, when the League moved into opposition.
Ministers can use state flights for institutional reasons but not for campaigning, which is what prosecutors suspect Salvini did as he criss-crossed Italy for months, sometimes combining interior ministry functions with party rallies.
""I read that I am under investigation,"" Salvini said on Thursday, after several newspapers carried reports of the investigation. ""All my state flights were for state reasons ... I never took state flights to go on holiday, that's what other politicians do.""
Italy's audit court, which specializes in issues related to public funds, looked into Salvini's case earlier this year.
It said his use of the flights was illegitimate but still dropped the case on the grounds that they had not caused an extra cost for the taxpayer.
The investigation is unlikely to affect support for the League, which is easily Italy's most popular party with the backing of about 30% of voters, according to opinion polls.
Legal problems have dogged Salvini and the League for months. In February, while Salvini was still a minister, parliament blocked an investigation into accusations of kidnapping over his decision to hold 150 migrants on board a ship for five days in August 2018.
Police searched offices of the Lombardy regional government and firms linked to the League on Tuesday in a money laundering probe connected with a 2018 ruling that ordered the League to repay 49 million euros ($54 million) it owed the state.
Prosecutors also opened an investigation into possible international corruption following media reports that the League tried to raise millions of euros via a secret Russian oil deal."

KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Vietnamese oil tanker which Reuters reported visited North Korea in February has been seized by Malaysia after it was found adrift off the Malaysian coast, maritime agency officials said.
Refinitiv shipping data quoted by Reuters showed the Viet Tin 01 arrived just outside the harbor of Nampo on North Korea's western coast on Feb. 25 carrying 2,000 tonnes of gasoline, shortly before talks between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in Hanoi.
It was not clear whether the tanker unloaded cargo at Nampo. Under sanctions imposed by the United Nations, North Korea is heavily restricted in its imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) said a team of officers boarded the tanker on Sunday after it was found anchored without authorization just off the southern Malaysian state of Johor.
""Earlier, the agency's vessel and boat assets... assigned to the site had attempted to contact the tanker via radio and speakers, but no response was received and the vessel was suspected to have been abandoned,"" Johor MMEA director Aminuddin Abdul Rashid said in a statement posted on the agency's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
The agency said the only person aboard the tanker was its 61-year-old Vietnamese chief engineer, who said the vessel had drifted from its original position.
The crew member detained for further investigations, Aminuddin said, but did not say whether the vessel was being investigated for its links to North Korea.
An MMEA spokesman said the authorities were waiting for the tanker's owners to claim it. He declined further comment.
Calls to Ho Chi Minh City-based Viet Trust Shipping Corp., the registered owner of the Viet Tin 01, went unanswered.
Since February the tanker has parked near China's coastline, first at the port of Shidao and then Shanghai, before stopping to transmit location data from its automatic identification system (AIS) between March 20 and July 9, shipping data showed.
On July 9, the tanker made a brief stop in Taiwan's Kaohsiung port before heading toward waters in southeast Malaysia where it arrived on July 20 and remained until at least Aug. 21, the data showed.
The Viet Tin 01 last transmitted AIS location data on Aug. 21."
620,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 06:43AM ET</span>",Former Turkish PM Davutoglu forms new party in challenge to Erdogan,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Former Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, once a close ally to President Tayyip Erdogan, applied on Thursday to establish a breakaway political party which could erode support for Erdogan and his ruling AK Party.
Davutoglu, 60, served as prime minister from 2014 to 2016, before falling out with Erdogan. Earlier this year, he slammed the president and the AK Party's (AKP) economic management, and accused them of curbing basic liberties and free speech.
A source close to Davutoglu said the former premier applied to the Interior Ministry on Thursday to form his new party and that he will formally announce it at a news conference in Ankara on Friday. It will be called Future Party, the source said.
""He will announce his party's principles and give information about the founding members,"" the source said. ""The new party will breathe new life into politics"".
Davutoglu announced his resignation from the Islamist-rooted AKP in September, saying it was no longer able to solve Turkey's problems and no longer allowed internal debate. His resignation came two months after former deputy prime minister Ali Babacan resigned from the AKP, citing ""deep differences"".
Earlier this year Turkey's main opposition party handed stinging defeats to Erdogan's AK Party in mayoral elections, taking control of the capital Ankara and Istanbul, the country's commercial hub, after more than two decades.
Babacan, will also announce his own rival political party within weeks, a source close to Babacan said.
""Efforts to form the party are in the last stages. The final changes are being made to the texts, the party's founders are nearly complete,"" the source said.
In his first televised interview since resigning from the AKP, Babacan said last month that Turkey was in a ""dark tunnel"" and warned of the dangers of ""one-man rule""."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Aboard a golden royal barge, King Maha Vajiralongkorn was rowed along the river winding through the oldest part of Bangkok on Thursday, as thousands of loyal Thais thronged the banks to see the final ritual of his drawn out coronation.
King Vajiralongkorn, also known as King Rama X, was formally crowned in May, during three days of ceremonies filled with ancient Brahmin and Buddhist rituals, but the barge procession marks the monarch's last journey in his ascent to the throne.
As part of a near seven-century-old tradition, the king's vessel was positioned in the center of a procession of 52 gold-painted barges, elaborately carved in the shape of swans and mythical creatures. 
Dressed in ceremonial costume, some 2,200 oarsmen rowed the wooden vessels along the 3.4-kilometre (2-mile) route, keeping time with the help of chants. 
The king was accompanied by Queen Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana and his 14-year-old son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, on one barge, while his two daughters were on another.
As the vessels glided over the Chao Phraya River, Thais dressed in the auspicious color yellow watched with reverence.
""I am a Thai and I want to attend this ceremony so I can tell my children about how great our country is,"" said Sudarat Sangyuthanan, a 55-year-old woman. 
Devotion to the monarch is an ingrained part of Thai culture where the king is considered by many as a living-god.
""The king has just been crowned and I want to show him that we, the Thai people, are with him and are supporting him all the way, so the country can progress in the way our forefathers have wanted to build it,"" said 64-year-old Patipan Mahantanathibodi. 
The monarchy's bond with the people was strengthened during Vajiralongkorn's father's 70-year reign. King Bhumibol Adulyadej
was widely loved and regarded as a pillar of stability during decades of political turbulence and rapid development in Thailand.
Though King Bhumibol forewent the barge ceremony at his own coronation, he revived their use to enhance the spectacle of major religious ceremonies, notably the celebration of the 2,500-year-old Buddhist era in 1957.
""In the past when there were no television or modern communication, so a ceremony like this allows members of the public to see the new king after he was crowned,"" Tongthong Chandransu, an expert on royal protocol told Reuters.
""The last time we had such a ceremony was almost a century ago,"" he said.

The last barge procession for a coronation was in 1925, when King Prajadhipok, Thailand's last absolute monarch, ascended the throne.

(Reuters) - The relentless pace of American shootings did not slow in 2019. But amid the harrowing scenes, heroes also emerged.
Here are just a few of the selfless acts the U.S. saw in the face of tragedy this year:
CHARGING GUNMAN, SAVING LIVES
When a gunman walked into a crowded classroom at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in April and began firing a pistol, 21-year-old environmental studies student Riley Howell screamed ""go, go, go!"" to classmates and forcefully tackled the shooter.
Police and witnesses said Howell, who was fatally shot, allowed fellow students to escape unharmed and enabled classmates to disarm the man. Another student, Ellis Parlier, 19, also died that day and four other students were wounded. Howell's family said in a statement after the shooting that their son ""radiated love and always will.""
HIGH SCHOOL HERO LUNGES AT COLORADO SHOOTER
It was just three days before graduation when the shooting began inside the Colorado high school. Two teenage gunmen had opened fire on fellow students at the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math School in Highlands Ranch. Authorities said far more kids would have died if not for Kendrick Ray Castillo, an 18-year-old lover of robotics who also enjoyed spending time with the elderly. Facing the barrel of a gun, Castillo lunged at one of the shooters, witnesses said. One of the gunmen ""shot Kendrick, giving all of us enough time to get underneath our desks, to get ourselves safe, and to run across the room to escape,"" student Nui Giasolli told NBC News.
Castillo was the only fatality that day, while eight other students were wounded.
TWO HEROES HAILED IN ATTACK ON CALIFORNIA SYNAGOGUE
When a teenage gunman opened fire at a California synagogue during Passover celebration in April, he had Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein directly in his sights. That was when Lori Gilbert-Kaye, 60, threw herself between the shooter and the rabbi inside Chabad of Poway synagogue in suburban San Diego, witnesses said. She was hit and quickly died.
Goldstein was shot in the hands but recovered, and said that Gilbert-Kaye's action saved his life. Congregants also praised the heroism of Oscar Stewart, 51, a U.S. Army and Navy veteran who served in Iraq and who chased the assailant outside, screaming, ""I'm going to kill you!""
""I was an instrument of God,"" Stewart said afterward. ""I had no conscious effort in what I was doing.""
BAR BOUNCER STARES DEATH IN THE FACE, SAVES DOZENS
When a gunman opened fire on a Dayton, Ohio, street known for its night life, panic ensued. But the toll of nine dead and 14 wounded would have been far worse had it not been for Jeremy Ganger, who was working as a bouncer at the Ned Peppers bar. Security camera footage showed Ganger helping dozens of people into the bar and away from the gunman.
""I was grabbing people off the street, telling them to get in and get down,"" Ganger told ABC News afterward, adding that he ""would've died before that guy came in."" Video showed the shooter turning to enter the bar and shouldering his rifle before the police shot him dead.
NAVY SAILOR SAVES LIVES IN FLORIDA SHOOTING
Joshua Kaleb Watson, a 2019 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, had just arrived at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, beginning his journey to become an aviator. That dream was taken on Dec. 6, when a Saudi Air Force lieutenant being trained at the base opened fire with a handgun in a classroom building. A wounded Watson, 23, made it outside and told responders where the shooter was before dying.
""He died a hero and we are beyond proud but there is a hole in our hearts that can never be filled,"" Joshua's brother Adam wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after his family was briefed by authorities. Two other sailors died in the shooting and eight more people were shot and injured.
The Navy posthumously awarded Wings of Gold to all those killed, making Watson a naval aviator in death."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean lawmakers are set to debate on Thursday a move to impeach President Sebastian Pinera over allegations he failed to safeguard human rights during weeks of rioting, a political test that he is likely to survive but may still batter his teetering presidency.
Small-scale protests that began in October over a hike in metro fares quickly spiraled out of control, leaving 26 dead, billions of dollars in damage and widespread allegations of abuses by security forces.
The center-right Pinera, a billionaire businessman, has borne the brunt of the blame. His approval rating at the end of November plunged to just 10%, the lowest for a president since Chile's return to democracy in 1990.
But the odds of impeachment remain long.
Even if a vote in the lower house reaches the simple majority needed to move the debate to the Senate, governing coalition lawmakers there can handily block the two-thirds vote needed for his ouster.
""Efforts to remove Pinera are not likely to succeed due to the composition of Congress,"" said Maria Luisa Puig, a Latin American specialist with Eurasia Group, adding that in reality public anger went beyond Pinera alone.
The most prominent grievances, from overhauling Chile's creaking pension system to slashing public services costs, date back to decisions made well before Pinera's time.
The handful of lawmakers from several opposition parties behind the impeachment bid say Pinera, who early in the crisis declared Chile ""at war with a powerful enemy,"" failed to act quickly enough to stamp out police abuses.
Pinera's legal team contends there is no link between his actions and any constitutional wrongdoing.
Several international rights groups have condemned police abuses. Pinera has promised deep reforms to police protocols.
A long or raucous debate on Thursday in the Chamber of Deputies could further dent Pinera's ailing image. If the chamber approves the impeachment motion, the Senate would then be required to hear the allegations in its next session.
Impeachment, however unlikely, would create more political chaos, said University of Chile public law professor Francisco Soto.
""The Constitution establishes a high bar for impeachment because it would put the country in a very complex situation,"" he said."
624,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 06:18AM ET</span>",Two soldiers injured as Russia's only aircraft carrier catches fire,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, caught fire on Thursday during maintenance work in Russia's Arctic port in Murmansk, and two soldiers were injured, Russian news agencies cited the defense ministry as saying.
The ship was successfully evacuated, the United Shipbuilding Corporation said, with emergency services working to tackle the blaze that began in the ship's hold. 
The Admiral Kuznetsov has seen action in Russia's military campaign in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, with its planes carrying out air strikes on rebel forces.
Misfortune has befallen the ship before. The vessel sustained damage during repair work last year when the floating dock holding it sank and a crane crashed onto its deck, leaving a gash up to five meters (16.5 feet) wide.
News agencies reported earlier that Thursday's fire in Murmansk had injured six people, citing a source. 
TASS news agency said the blaze had started on the upper deck and that thick, black smoke was billowing from the vessel. 
A source in the emergency services told TASS that firefighters were finding it difficult to reach the blaze because of the heavy smoke caused by burning cables. 
The Admiral Kuznetsov gained notoriety in Britain in 2017 when then-Defense Secretary Michael Fallon dubbed it the ""ship of shame"" as it passed through waters close to the English coast en route back from the Mediterranean belching black smoke.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Thursday will try to persuade a federal appeals court that the death sentence he faces is unfair because it was handed down by a tainted jury.
Tsarnaev's defense team, in briefs filed with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, have argued that the publicity and manhunt leading to his capture in April 2013 biased the pool of potential jurors, including one actual juror who joined the unanimous vote for the death penalty.
The then-19-year-old Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan sparked five days of panic in Boston when they detonated a pair of homemade pressure cooker bombs at the marathon's finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 200.
The pair eluded capture for days, punctuated by a gunbattle with police in Watertown, Massachusetts, in which Tamerlan was killed. Boston and most of its suburbs were locked down for a day as armed officers and troops conducted a house-to-house search for Dzhokhar.
Tsarnaev, now 26, was sentenced to death in 2015 after a jury found him guilty of killing three people in the April 15, 2013 bombing - Martin Richard, 8; Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 26, and restaurant manager Krystle Campbell - and murdering Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26, three days later as the brothers attempted to flee.
Tsarnaev is not expected to be present during two hours of oral arguments at the same federal courthouse in Boston where he was convicted. His lawyers are asking the appeals court to reverse his death sentence.
""Tsarnaev was tried in a community still suffering from his crimes,"" his defense team argued in court papers. ""Two of the jurors who voted to sentence him to death lied during (jury selection), including the foreperson, who falsely denied calling Tsarnaev a 'piece of garbage' on Twitter, and, as the government concedes, failed to disclose that she and her family had sheltered in place in their Dorchester home during the manhunt.""
U.S. Justice Department lawyers say Tsarnaev received a fair trial and the jury was picked from a population mostly opposed to the death penalty. During his trial, a poll by the Boston Globe showed that about two-thirds of Massachusetts residents favored a life sentence for Tsarnaev.
During the trial, the family of the youngest victim, Richard, also asked prosecutors to consider taking the death penalty off the table."

The Silvana III tanker refused to allow inspectors aboard after anchoring last week in Malaysian waters without approval, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) said.
According to shipping transparency website Equasis.org, the vessel is managed by Kunlun Shipping Co Ltd, one of several firms placed under U.S. sanctions this year for alleged involvement in transporting oil from Iran.
The ministry said the MMEA had inspected ""a foreign registered vessel"" on Tuesday anchored in waters off Penang on the country's northwest coast and due to an engine problem it was towed to port on the island of Langkawi.
""The vessel has since been released upon the completion of the repair. The vessel with its 25-member crew is now en route to its next port of call,"" the ministry said.
The ministry did not name the vessel, but spokespeople for the ministry and the MMEA said the statement referred to the Silvana III.
The ministry did not respond to queries about the incident last week in which the MMEA on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page said the Silvana III had anchored on Dec. 5 and did not follow instructions to drop its ladder to allow officers to conduct an inspection.
After Reuters requested details on Wednesday, the post on MMEA's Facebook page was taken down.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's election campaign has delivered funny, strange and surreal moments, from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit-branded boxing to a stranded train full of journalists on their way to a speech about rail investment.
Here are some the highlights from six weeks of cross-country campaigning:
DELIVERING THE MESSAGE (Dec. 11)
What do a donut, a digger, boxing gloves and a scarf have in common? All have been printed, painted, woven or iced with the Conservative election slogan ""Get Brexit Done"".
It is not unusual for political parties to come up with one or two central campaign messages and plaster them across lecterns, placards and buses.
But while Labour's ""Time for real change"" and ""For the many, not the few"" slogans have appeared in the usual places, Johnson's Conservatives have gone to greater lengths to try and ensure their message gets through.
On a whistle-stop final day of campaigning Johnson added a few more to the list: a branded apron worn while making a pie and a milk crate used to make a delivery to a voter's house.
GOVERNMENT BORROWING UP (Dec. 3)
Johnson's efforts to stimulate the economy in the English city of Salisbury ran out of cash.
Touring local businesses at a Christmas market, Johnson visited a butcher and helped out at one stall, serving up sweets in front of the cameras.
But the prime minister, whose Conservatives have cast themselves as the party of fiscal discipline, came unstuck when he tried to pay for chocolate brownies.
Fumbling through his wallet, Johnson had to ask his team for a loan. ""I'm out of cash"" he said. ""I lashed out on some sausages earlier on and it cleaned me out!""
CORBYN'S LITTLE RED BOOK (Dec. 3)
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, carries a little red book with him all over the country.
Not the collection of quotations from communist leader Mao Zedong - once brandished in parliament by Corbyn's would-be finance minister - but a handwritten diary of knowledge he has picked up on the election trail.
""The wisdom that is there amongst people all over the country is something that absolutely inspires me, I go around with a notebook everywhere,"" he said during a television interview.
His interviewer on chat show 'This Morning' asked: ""What are you going to write about us?""
He replied: ""What a charming morning I am having, what wonderful Christmas decorations you’ve got.""
THE CASE FOR RAIL INVESTMENT (Nov. 7)
British finance minister Sajid Javid tore up the spending rules by promising to pump billions into upgrading the country's schools, hospitals, roads and railways.
Shortly before his speech was due to start, word went around from a Conservative Party official that the start of the event in the northern English city of Manchester would have to be delayed - problems on the railway had left the traveling press pack stranded miles from the venue.
SIGNED, SEALED... DELIVERED? (Nov. 22)
When is a manifesto not a manifesto? Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says it is when it's a 'contract with the people'.
Farage eschewed the campaign tradition of a manifesto launch, a glitzy media event to promote a book of policies the party wants to implement if it wins power.
Instead, he invited journalists, left a small book of his policies on each seat and made a grand entrance to a thumping soundtrack ('Power' by Kanye West).
""This is not a manifesto, because a word association test for manifesto gave us the word 'lies',"" he said. ""It's a contract with the people."""

The EU has threatened to suspend its Everything But Arms (EBA) trade scheme with Cambodia after a European Commission report found that Prime Minister Hun Sen's government has cracked down on the opposition, civil society groups and the media.
It has given Cambodia a Thursday deadline to respond to the allegations and a final decision whether or not to suspend the EBA will be made in February next year.
Cambodia's Foreign Ministry said the government had handed in its response.
The response is ""a comprehensive report on the actions and measures undertaken by the Royal Government to respond to all the areas of concerns"" by the EU, in particular with respect to the right to political participation, land rights, freedom of expression and freedom of association, the ministry said.
""The Royal Government expects that the European Commission will take into consideration the government's good faith efforts to implement all the relevant international conventions under the EBA regulations, the potential social impact (on) nearly one million female workers and the indirect effect on families and relatives supported by these workers' wages, as well as respecting the principles of sovereignty and non-interference into Cambodia's internal affairs,"" the ministry said.
Almost all factory workers in Cambodia are women.
On Wednesday, Hun Sen dismissed the threat by the EU to withdraw trade privileges, saying Britain's exit from the bloc will ease the pain of sanctions.
The European Union accounts for nearly half of Cambodia's exports, with Germany being the largest export market for Cambodia, taking roughly 11 percent of its goods, while Britain is the second largest, buying over 8 percent of goods from the Southeast Asian country, according to official data. Garments make up a large chunk of the exports.
Western countries have condemned the arrest of opposition leader Kem Sokha, who was arrested in 2017 before his opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was banned ahead of an election last year.
Kem Sokha was freed from house arrest last month but a ban on his political activity was kept in place. His trial will begin on Jan. 15."

BRUSSELS/PRAGUE (Reuters) - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were threatening on Thursday to wreck the European Union's new push for climate neutrality by 2050, just a day after the bloc's executive trumpeted it as Europe's ""man on the moon"" moment.
The 27 EU national leaders will meet in Brussels and push to agree to put their bloc on net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, luring the reluctant eastern member states with extra money to transform their economies.
With floods, fires and droughts wrecking lives around the world, Greenpeace climate activists climbed the Brussels building where the leaders were to meet, unfurling banners reading ""Climate Emergency"", firing off red flares and blaring fire alarm sirens. Some were detained by police.
The eastern countries want more money to fund a transition to a future of lower emissions, including a role for nuclear power which emits no carbon but which Germany and others aim to phase out.
""It is important to have certainty that nobody will stop us in the construction of nuclear power units,"" Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis told reporters before leaving for Brussels.
""We have to have electricity for people, for firms, and heating. And that is the priority and I will see. I don't rule out anything.""
A senior diplomat from one of those hesitant countries said of the latest draft summit decision: ""For us, it definitely does not go far enough. Both in terms of nuclear, but also on burden-sharing and financial support.""
Another EU diplomat estimated chances for an agreement at the summit - which must be unanimous - at 50/50.
The bloc's new chief executive proposed a Green Deal this week to mobilize 100 billion euros worth of investment to help economies move away from fossil fuels.
But Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are not yet on board, demanding that any decision spells out in more detail the scale and scope of financing available, and pushing to include funding for nuclear energy.
""There will certainly be an amount of arm-wrestling,"" said a second senior EU diplomat from a country more enthusiastic about the 2050 goal. ""There will have to be new money... but some member states will be less than enthusiastic about the target of raising 100 billion euros.""
The Czech Republic generates about half of its electricity from coal and wants to phase most of it out over the next 20 years, replacing part of it with new nuclear power plants.
Hungary relies on nuclear for about a third of its energy needs, with coal making up less than 15% of its energy mix. It wants to abolish coal by 2030 and replace it with a mix of nuclear, gas, renewables and energy imports.
Poland produces some 80% of its power from coal and discussions about introducing nuclear energy have not yet been settled, partly due to high costs.
The climate discussion feeds into another tricky debate, over the next long-term budget, where no agreement is expected after a latest proposal to cap joint spending at 1.087 trillion euros for 2021-27 was rejected by both the frugal camp and those seeking heavier outlay."

Two weeks ago, Libya's internationally recognized government and Turkey signed the maritime delimitation agreement, in a move that escalated disputes over potential offshore gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean.
Turkey says the accord aims to protect its rights and is in line with international law. President Tayyip Erdogan said that the accord will allow Turkey and Libya to hold joint exploration operations in the region.
Infuriated by the pact, Greece accused Libya's government of deception and expelled the Libyan ambassador to Athens. It also said it had lodged objections with the United Nations, saying the accord violated international law. 
Tensions were already running high between Greece and Turkey because of Turkish gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus. The NATO members are also at odds over mineral rights in the Aegean Sea.
The European Union has readied sanctions against Turkey in response to its actions around Cyprus, which was split in a 1974 Turkish invasion following a Greek-inspired coup. Peace talks on the island have been in limbo since U.N.-led efforts collapsed in 2017.

632,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>",Protesters set fire to train stations in India over citizenship law,"GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - Protesters attacked train stations in India's northeast, authorities said on Thursday, angry over a new federal law that would make it easier for non-Muslim minorities from some neighboring countries to seek Indian citizenship.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government has said the Citizenship Amendment Bill, approved by parliament on Wednesday, was meant to protect minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Protesters in the northeastern state of Assam, which shares a border with Bangladesh, say the measure will open the region to a flood of foreigners. Others said the bigger problem with the new law was that it undermined India's secular constitution by not offering protection to Muslims.
Police fired tear gas in Assam's main city of Guwahati to break up small groups of people who were demonstrating in the streets, defying a curfew imposed on Wednesday. 
""This is a spontaneous public outburst,"" said Nehal Jain, a masters student in communications in Guwahati. ""First they tell us there are too many illegal immigrants and we need to get rid of them. Then they bring in this law that would allow citizenship to immigrants,"" she said.
A movement against illegal migrants has simmered in tea-growing Assam state for decades.
The citizenship amendment law grants Indian nationality to Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs who fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan before 2015.
Protesters vandalized four railway stations in Assam and tried to set fire to them, a railway spokesman said. Train services were suspended, stranding scores of passengers. IndiGo said it had canceled flights because of the unrest in Assam.
SUMMIT
The turmoil in Assam comes days ahead of a summit Modi plans to host for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe there as part of his campaign to move high-profile diplomatic events outside of Delhi to showcase India's diversity.
Modi urged calm and said the people of Assam had nothing to fear. ""I want to assure them - no one can take away your rights, unique identity and beautiful culture. It will continue to flourish and grow,"" he tweeted. 
More troops have been deployed to Assam to restore peace and mobile internet was suspended in 10 districts, the government said.
The new law is also raising concerns that Modi's government is pushing a Hindu-first identity for India and fanning fears for the future of Muslims, the biggest minority group.
The Indian Express said the law, which requires presidential assent, unfairly targets India's 170 million Muslims.
""It is a political signal of a terrible narrowing, a chilling exclusion, directed at India’s own largest minority. India is to be redefined as the natural home of Hindus, it says to India’s Muslims. And that they must, therefore, be content with a less natural citizenship.""
The government has said the new law will be followed by a citizenship register that means Muslims must prove they were original residents of India and not refugees from these three countries, potentially rendering some of them stateless.
Members of other faiths listed in the law, by contrast, have a clear path to citizenship.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 04:35AM ET</span>","United Kingdom votes to decide the fate of Brexit, again","By Guy Faulconbridge and Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Voters went to the polls on Thursday in an election that will pave the way for Brexit under Prime Minister Boris Johnson or propel Britain towards another referendum that could ultimately reverse the decision to leave the European Union.
After failing to deliver Brexit by an Oct. 31 deadline, Johnson called the election to break what he cast as political paralysis that had thwarted Britain's departure and sapped confidence in the economy.
The face of the ""Leave"" campaign in the 2016 referendum, 55-year-old Johnson fought the election under the slogan of ""Get Brexit Done"", promising to end the deadlock and spend more on health, education and the police.
His main opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, 70, promised higher public spending, nationalization of key services, taxes on the wealthy and another referendum on Brexit.
All major opinion polls suggest Johnson will win, though pollsters got the 2016 referendum wrong and their models predict outcomes ranging from a hung parliament to the biggest Conservative landslide since the era of Margaret Thatcher.
Seven eve-of-election opinion polls published on Wednesday showed the Conservatives ahead of Labour by an average of nearly 10 points although Labour narrowed the gap in four of them.
""We could have a Conservative majority government which will get Brexit done and unleash Britain’s potential,"" Johnson told campaigners. ""This election is our chance to end the gridlock but the result is on a knife-edge.""
Corbyn said the Conservatives were the party of ""billionaires"" while Labour represented the many.
""You can vote for despair and vote for the dishonesty of this government, or you can vote Labour and get a government that can bring hope to the future,"" he said.
Polls opened at 0700 GMT and will close at 2200 GMT when an exit poll will give the first indications of the result. Official results from the bulk of the United Kingdom's 650 constituencies begin to come in from 2300 GMT to 0500 GMT.
While Brexit framed the United Kingdom's first December election since 1923, the tortuous exit from the EU has variously fatigued, enthused and enraged voters while eroding loyalties to the two major parties.
Factbox: the 50 seats to watch (https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-election-seats-factbox/factbox-the-british-election-50-seats-to-watch-idUKKBN1YF1WQ?il=0)
BREXIT AND BORIS
A majority would allow Johnson to lead the country out of the club it joined in 1973, but Brexit would be far from over. He must negotiate a trade agreement with the EU in a self-imposed deadline of 11 months.
After Jan. 31, Britain would enter a transition period during which it would negotiate a new relationship with the 27 EU members. He has pledged to do that by the end of 2020.
Sterling markets are pricing in a Johnson win and the pound was up against the dollar and the euro in early trading on Thursday.
But two historic referendums - on Scottish independence in 2014 and Brexit in 2016 - and two national elections in 2015 and 2017 have delivered often unexpected results that ushered in political crises.
The election pitches two of the most unconventional British politicians of recent years against each other. Both have been repeatedly written off by opponents and both offer starkly different visions for the world's fifth-largest economy.
Johnson's pitch is Brexit but he shrank from anything more radical in a heavily choreographed campaign. Corbyn pitched what he calls a radical transformation for a country long wedded to free-market liberalism.
Johnson, the New York-born former mayor of London, won the top job in July. His predecessor, Theresa May, resigned after failing to get parliamentary backing for her Brexit deal with the EU and then losing her party's majority in a snap election.
Johnson defied critics by striking a new deal with the EU but was unable to navigate the maze of a divided British parliament and was defeated by opponents whom he portrayed as subverting the will of the people.
The United Kingdom voted 52%-48% in 2016 to quit the EU. But parliament has been deadlocked since May's failed bet on a 2017 snap election over how, when and even whether to leave.
Corbyn, once an opponent of the EU, says he would remain neutral if he was a prime minister overseeing another referendum. He pledged to overthrow a ""rigged system"" he said was run by billionaires and tax dodgers."
634,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 04:25AM ET</span>",Israel 'very troubled' by Corbyn run in British election,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel voiced worry about Britain's election on Thursday, describing the possible rise of the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn as a threat to bilateral ties and alarming for British Jews.
Corbyn, a veteran pro-Palestinian activist, has been buffeted by allegations of anti-Semitism in Labour, with British media quoting some of the country's Jews as saying they would consider emigrating should he be elected.
""This (election) very much troubles us,"" Deputy Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely told Ynet TV. ""It is true that we as a country cannot say we support this-or-that candidate, but Corbyn is a real danger to Israel-Britain relations, and I know British Jewry are very worried about this possibility.""
Corbyn and Labour, Britain's biggest opposition party, say they oppose anti-Semitism. They say the party is not institutionally anti-Semitic, that complaints relate to a small minority of members, and that the processes to deal with such allegations have now improved.
Corbyn has called for recognizing a Palestinian state and reviewing British arms exports to Israel, riling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rightist government.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said last week that he hoped Corbyn would lose the election to Boris Johnson, the Conservative prime minister. Netanyahu has not commented on the ballot.
""It must be understood that the things that Corbyn says, and the wind blowing through Labour today, is a wind of anti-Semitism. And this is a very grave matter,"" Hotovely said.
""Jews will always have a place in the State of Israel. In other words, they do not have to feel endangered. But it is important to understand that this election is really a fateful election, and we really have to wait patiently here.""

The training was conducted at heights of 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) and lasted seven days and nights, with troops climbing mountains, crossing icy rivers and using drones to target ""thugs"" with stolen guns.
The video shows the troops surrounding a hut where a suspect is hiding and then start shooting at him as he ran out.
The aim of the drill was to allow troops to succeed in ""wild, unfamiliar, and complicated conditions,"" CCTV said.
China blames unrest in Xinjiang on Islamist militants and has been waging an anti-terror campaign in the region in recent years.
Rights groups and exiles say anger at tightening Chinese controls on the religion and culture of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang is more to blame for the unrest.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in camps under the anti-terror campaign.
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs and says the camps provide vocational training. It describes the detainees as students.
The government says there have been no terror attacks in the past three years as result of these strict measures.
Last week, it released a multi-part documentary on past terrorist attacks in Urumqi, Beijing and Kunming cities on its official English language broadcaster CGTN."

The army, the strongest political player, sees the vote as the only way to restore order in Africa's largest country, a major natural gas supplier to Europe and home to 40 million people. 
Early in the morning, it was quiet at one central Algiers polling station, though police were patrolling the city's streets on foot and in vehicles. 
""The country has entered a critical phase,"" said Aziz Djibali, 56, who went to vote at a polling station near the prime minister's office. 
""It's time for Algerians to voice their opinions peacefully.""
However, demonstrators at the huge protests that have roiled Algiers and other major cities for almost 10 months have sworn they will boycott Thursday's vote, which they see as a charade designed to keep the existing ruling elite in place. 
The five men on the ballot are all former senior officials, including two former prime ministers and two former government ministers, who, protesters believe, are unlikely to challenge the army's political primacy. 
Protests helped oust veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April, and forced the authorities to twice delay an election previously scheduled for April and July.

However, powerful army chief Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah has insisted the vote now go ahead as the only way to restore legitimacy to the government and end the standoff between protesters and the state.

WHAKATANE/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Police in New Zealand are planning a mission to volcanic White Island on Friday to retrieve bodies of people killed in this week's eruption, while the known death toll from the disaster climbed to eight, with two people dying in hospital.
Eight more people are missing and presumed dead, buried under ash and debris from Monday's eruption. More than 20 people are in hospital, many with severe burns, while seven others have been transferred to burns units in Australia.
""I can now confirm that we are finalizing a plan to recover the bodies from Whakaari/ White Island tomorrow morning,"" police Deputy Commissioner John Tims said in a statement on Thursday, adding families will be briefed on the operation.
Another police officer, Deputy Commissioner Mike Clement, later told a news conference the mission was risky and that a team would deploy at first light on Friday.
Six bodies could be seen and there would be ""very limited"" opportunity to search for the other two, he said.
""A lot has to go right for this to work,"" Clement said.
The volcano on White Island was ""highly volatile"" and could erupt again within days, said authorities.
There are no signs of life on the uninhabited island.
""We are now living with a growing sense of desperation to bring home those that we know are there and those we love,"" said Judy Turner, the mayor of Whakatane, the nearest town on the mainland. ""The frustration of those families most affected is completely understandable. No news is not good news for people in this situation.""
The volcano, a popular tourist destination for day-trips, erupted on Monday, spewing ash and steam over the island.
There were 47 people on the island, also known by its Maori name Whakaari, at the time of the eruption. Twenty-four of those were from Australia, nine from the United States, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two each from China and Britain and one from Malaysia.
Graham Leonard, a senior scientist at New Zealand's geological science agency GNS Science, said monitoring equipment still active on the island put the risk of a further eruption over the next 24 hours at 50% to 60%, up from 40% to 60% on Wednesday.
""Today is less safe than yesterday and the day before,"" he said.
In the event of another eruption, anybody on the island could be ""pummeled to death"" by flying rocks or overcome by ash and gases in temperatures exceeding hundreds of degrees Celsius, said GNS Science volcanologist Nico Fournier.
Clement said earlier the risk of both another eruption and toxic gases were simply too great on Thursday to expose recovery teams, although the situation was being constantly reviewed.

BURN INJURIES
Many of the injured are being treated for severe burns, and medical officials are importing some 1.2 million square cm (186,000 square inches) of skin. The amount of skin needed equates to about 60 donors. In New Zealand, only five to 10 people donate skin each year, the New Zealand Herald reported.
Teams of surgeons in several burns units around the country were working around the clock.
""What we faced on Monday was beyond comprehension,"" Dr Heike Hundemer, clinical leader at Whakatane hospital, said at a media conference on Wednesday.
""I've worked in major centers in Germany as well as in New Zealand. I've never seen this number of critically injured patients coming into an emergency department in a short space of time,"" said Hundemer.
""We used every single bedspace, every single resource we had to care for those people. Those patients we treated and comforted will forever stay in our minds.""
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said 12 Australians would be taken back home for treatment. One citizen would remain in a New Zealand hospital.
Morrison said 11 Australians had died, a figure that is believed to be drawn from the 16 people officially listed dead and missing by New Zealand. Further, he said two permanent residents of Australia had died, one was missing and a fourth was hospitalized.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said there will be an inquiry into the tragedy, which will also look more broadly at issues including access to volcanic sites across New Zealand.
Daily tours bring more than 10,000 visitors to privately owned White Island every year, marketed as ""the world's most accessible active marine volcano"".
 Royal Caribbean  (N:RCL) cruise lines has said that passengers from its ship 'Ovation of the Seas' were on the island at the time. It said it grieved ""this tragic loss"" and would continue to offer support and services to affected families.
The 'Ovation of the Seas' docked in Wellington on Thursday.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 01:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Protest-free Macau to win financial policy rewards from China,"By Farah Master and Keith Zhai
MACAU/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Macau next week to announce a raft of new policies aimed at diversifying the city's casino-dependent economy into a financial center, according to over a dozen interviews with officials and corporate executives.
The move is seen by officials and executives in Macau as a reward for having avoided the anti-government protests that have gripped nearby Hong Kong over the past six months.
The policies include the establishment of a yuan-denominated stock exchange and the acceleration of a renminbi settlement center already in the works, as well as the allocation of land for Macau to develop in neighboring mainland China, they said.
While there has been speculation about the proposals in recent months, the fact they have been officially approved has not previously been reported.
""The financial industry used to be an idea that we reserved for Hong Kong,"" said one Chinese official who requested anonymity. ""We used to give all the favorable policies to Hong Kong. But now we want to diversify it.""
Xi's trip to mark the 20th anniversary of Macau's return to China comes as the central government has praised the city for upholding the ""one country, two systems"" framework that governs both Hong Kong and Macau.
In contrast, China has condemned anti-government protests in Hong Kong and accused demonstrators in the financial center of undermining national stability.
China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not respond to requests for comment. 
     
DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY
Beijing has instructed state-owned banks and enterprises to help set up infrastructure in Macau to aid financial diversification, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Two officials who helped develop the Shanghai stock exchange moved to the territory this year to help establish its yuan-based stock exchange, one of the sources said. 
Chinese officials, and bankers in Hong Kong, say the push to develop financial infrastructure in Macau is part of a plan to avoid any major market disruption in Hong Kong that could impact Chinese businesses. 
The idea is not for Macau to replace or undermine Hong Kong but for China to have a contingency plan in case the situation in Hong Kong worsens, they said. 
""Xi Jinping has made very clear that he wants a diversified Macau economy,"" said another Chinese official who declined to be identified. The future focus will be on tourism and finance, to make it a center to host international meetings like Singapore.""
Macau's new exchange will initially be focused on bond trading to encourage local and Chinese companies to issue debt in the city, according to a Chinese official familiar with the matter.
The exchange will also focus on start-ups and target companies from Portuguese-speaking countries, ensuring it does not directly compete with bourses in Hong Kong or in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, according to six Macau executives and Chinese officials. Macau was a Portuguese colony until it was handed to China in 1999.
An announcement that Macau will join the Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is also expected during Xi's visit, two Chinese officials said.
DEEPER INTEGRATION
Xi is expected to announce policies to further integrate Macau with mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area, the region around the Pearl River Delta that also includes Hong Kong, according to Chinese officials and Macau executives.
As part of that effort, Macau will be allocated more land on the mainland island of Hengqin to develop in areas such as education and healthcare, they said.
Macau's casino operators, which have been hit by slowing economic growth, the Sino-U.S. trade war and a weakening Chinese yuan, are also looking at development opportunities in Hengqin, casino executives said.
The economic slowdown in China has added to pressure on Macau to diversify its economy from the casino industry, which accounts for more than 80% of government revenues.
""We plan to work with the Macau government to launch programs that encourage next-generation entrepreneurs to start businesses in Hengqin,"" said Lawrence Ho, chief executive of Melco Resorts, which runs three casino resorts in Macau.
Sands China, another casino operator, said it was looking at setting up a training academy in Hengqin.
Beijing has previously allocated Macau portions of land on the former oyster farming island, which lies just across the water from its casinos, including land for Macau University's campus which opened in 2013. 
While the new initiatives were not explicitly linked to toeing the official line, Chinese officials have repeatedly praised Macau for setting an example in maintaining national security and adhering to the central government's requirements.
""This is the candy that Hong Kong did not want,"" said Larry So, a political commentator and retired Macau university professor. ""It is a gift for Macau, for Macau being a good boy.""
    
MACAU MODEL
In recent weeks, Xi has said at several gatherings of senior government officials that it is crucial to find ways to implement the ""Macau model"" in Hong Kong, two people familiar with the discussions said, on condition of anonymity.
""President Xi Jinping spoke highly of the practice of one country, two systems with Macau characteristics. This is an encouragement and a spur,"" Macau's chief executive, Fernando Chui, said at a meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing on Dec. 3, according to an official transcript.
More than half of Macau's population of 600,000 immigrated from China in recent decades, which has helped the territory foster a stronger affinity for the mainland than in Hong Kong, where most of the population was locally born.
Millions of dollars also have been ploughed into creating youth associations in Macau linked to the Chinese government. Many of Macau's associations are traditional pro-establishment groups that dole out generous subsidies to residents.
""Macau will be an example of China's reunification,"" Ho Iat Seng, who is set to become Macau's next chief executive on Dec. 20, told state broadcaster China Central Television last month.

The city was well placed to ""better develop the one country, two systems principle"", he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee backed legislation on Wednesday to impose sanctions on Turkey after its offensive in Syria and purchase of a Russian S-400 missile system, the latest move in the chamber to push Republican President Donald Trump to take a harder line against Ankara.
The Republican-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted by 18-4 to send the ""Promoting American National Security and Preventing the Resurgence of ISIS Act of 2019"" for a vote in the full Senate.
""Now's the time for the Senate to come together and take this opportunity to change Turkey's behavior,"" said Senator Jim Risch, the panel's Republican chairman, a lead sponsor of the bill with Senator Bob Menendez, the panel's top Democrat.
Another Republican, Senator Rand Paul, opposed the act. He said it would weaken the president's power and could make it more difficult to negotiate with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on matters such as the NATO ally's purchase of the missile system and fighting in Syria.
Other senators strongly disagreed. Many lawmakers, Trump's fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, are angry about Turkey's S-400 purchase, which they see as a threat to NATO defenses.
They also criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, which cleared the way for Turkey's offensive in the area against Kurdish militias, who until recently were fighting alongside American forces against Islamic State militants.
""This is not some minor dustup with this country. This is a drift by this country, Turkey, to go in an entirely different direction than what they have in the past,"" Risch said.
""They've thumbed their nose at us, and they've thumbed their nose at their other NATO allies,"" he said.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry described the latest initiatives in Congress as ""a new manifestation of disrespect for our sovereign decisions regarding our national security.""
""These initiatives do not have any function other than to harm Turkish-U.S. relations,"" it said in a statement overnight, calling on Congress to act with common sense.
Turkey, which has not wavered from its plans to buy the Russian system despite Erdogan's recent visit to the White House, earlier vowed to retaliate against any U.S. sanctions over its purchase of the S-400 and said they would not affect its use of the Russian systems. 
""It is understood that members of (the U.S.) Congress have shut their eyes and ears to the truth,"" Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said.
To become law, the legislation would have to pass the House of Representatives, which passed its own Turkish sanctions bill by an overwhelming 403-16 vote in October and be signed by Trump.

(Reuters) - Hong Kong police said they arrested three people in connection with arson and vandalism in Kowloon late Wednesday.
In a news release on Thursday morning, the police said three people - a 15-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy and a 29-year-old man - were arrested in connection with vandalizing public buses. A fourth person escaped, police said. 
According to police reports the four boarded buses, pressed the emergency buttons, then began smashing windows with hammers.
Police also said they received reports that five people threw petrol bombs at a Japanese restaurant on the street level of a shopping mall in Cheung Sha Wan. There were no reported injuries. 
Police said several other people started a fire at a street junction in Mong Kok, an area that has regularly been the site of violent clashes between protesters and police during more than six months of social unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.
Police did not say the vandalism was connected to the protests.
Separately, the Hong Kong Football Club Rugby Section announced it has canceled its annual rugby tens tournament, scheduled for next April, due to the unrest.
""Owing to the ongoing situation in Hong Kong, the tournament has, for the first time, had difficulty in attracting and securing firm commitments from enough overseas teams of sufficient quality,"" the football club said in a statement Thursday.
The tens tournament is traditionally played ahead of the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, with both events drawing prominent names in the rugby world.

645,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 09:46PM ET</span>","Israel to hold March 2 election, its third in less than a year","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will hold an election on March 2, its third in less than a year, parliament decided on Thursday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival failed to parlay the previous two ballots into a new coalition government.
By a vote of 94 in favor to none opposed, lawmakers approved a motion dissolving parliament and setting the new election date. It came hours after a final deadline passed to form a government following the last election in September. 
In that ballot, and in the one prior in April, Netanyahu's conservative Likud party deadlocked with ex-general Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White. Neither managed to muster enough support in the 120-seat Knesset for a stable coalition.
The next election, however, will be held in the shadow of an corruption indictment handed down against Netanyahu last month.
Denying any wrongdoing, Netanyahu, 70, has accused legal authorities of attempting a “coup” aimed at ousting a popular four-term leader. Critics alleged that Netanyahu was trying to undermine the rule of law and set an election campaign theme portraying himself as the victim of “deep state” conspiracy.
As prime minister, Netanyahu is under no legal obligation to resign as a result of the indictment, and while in office he can ask the legislature to grant him immunity from prosecution.
As caretaker premier, Netanyahu would remain in the post until a new government is formed - a process that could stretch months past the March election if what is likely to be a tortuous new round of coalition-building is taken into account.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The reading pile in New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's office includes a children's picture book about U.S. President Donald Trump's border wall.
""Dear Donald Trump"" tells the tale of a young New Zealand boy who writes a series of unanswered letters to the U.S. president seeking advice about building a wall to keep his ""undesirable"" older brother out of his side of a shared bedroom.
The book was one of several, including children's books, lying on a table in Ardern's office during an interview with Reuters on Wednesday.
""I probably need to move a couple of those,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""'Dear Donald Trump' is hilarious.""
Ardern shot to international prominence in 2017 after she became the country's youngest female leader at just 37. Her 18-month-old daughter is a frequent visitor to her office.
Ardern has been described by some liberal supporters as an 'anti-Trump', promoting issues such as social justice, multilateralism, environmental protection and equality in high-profile international forums including the United Nations.
She has played down the comparison, describing her meeting with Trump in New York in September in positive terms.
A spokesman for the prime minister declined to comment on the book.
In ""Dear Donald Trump"", the main character sticks with his plan to build a wall despite opposition from his family until eventually finding a compromise. His letters to Trump are never answered.
Sophie Siers, the New Zealand author, said earlier this year she was inspired to write the book during the debate about Trump's plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.

The book pile in Ardern's office included another title by Siers, ""Dear Princess Meghan"", about a series of letters to the U.S. actress who married into the British Royal Family and ""She Persisted"", a child's book about ""13 American women who changed the world"" by former U.S. first daughter Chelsea Clinton.

647,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 07:59PM ET</span>",Brazen kidnappings multiply in Myanmar's Rakhine state as conflict deepens,"By Shoon Naing and Thu Thu Aung
YANGON (Reuters) - It was a brazen daytime attack by ethnic rebels fighting for greater autonomy in the jungles of western Myanmar.
After storming a boat off the coast of Rakhine state, the insurgents kidnapped a lawmaker from the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) and nine other people, including staff of an Indian construction firm.
The abductions by Arakan Army rebels on Nov. 3 were the highest-profile in a series of kidnappings they have carried out in their intensifying year-long campaign against the government.
The ethnic Rakhine insurgency, believed to include thousands of rebels, poses a serious threat to the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in an increasingly lawless region already destabilized by a military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims. 
More than 730,000 Rohingyas fled the crackdown in 2017, a campaign that U.N investigators said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"". The state is also a center for major Chinese investments in an oil pipeline and a port, and the government hopes to further develop the region.
The Rakhine rebels are fighting for greater autonomy for their impoverished state, recruiting from the mostly Buddhist majority. The central government has long had a tenuous grip in Rakhine, which borders Bangladesh and is largely separated from the rest of Myanmar by a range of jungle-clad mountains. The ruling NLD suffered defeat in the state to a Rakhine nationalist party during the national elections of 2015.
The Arakan Army was formed in 2009 but had been relatively low-profile before the latest surge in fighting, which erupted in January when rebels attacked four police stations in Rakhine.
The government has vowed to crush the rebels, sending thousands of troops into Rakhine, and cutting off Internet connections across the region.
'GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE'
The rebels have turned to kidnappings in response. In recent months, dozens of people have been seized from buses and boats, while suspected informers have been detained in villages, according to local officials, the rebels and media reports.
Contacted for comment by Reuters, the military's spokesman, Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, called the kidnappings by the rebels ""terrorism"", and defended the military's response to the insurgency as justified. 
In October, suspected rebels disguised as football players boarded a bus and took dozens of firefighters and civilians hostage in Mrauk-U, the historic former capital of the region.
The same month, rebels seized more than 50 people, most of them members of the security forces, from a ferry near Buthidaung township. Myanmar soldiers then shot at and sank vessels carrying the captured men, killing dozens, according to the rebels. Reuters was unable to reach the military spokesman to get comment on the sinking of the vessels.
The Myanmar government did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. The government spokesman, Zaw Htay, last month condemned attacks by the Arakan Army, calling them a violation of the country's sovereignty.
The Arakan Army spokesman, Khine Thu Kha, acknowledged abducting civilians but said the group did not harm them.
""We must arrest them if necessary,"" Khine Thu Kha told Reuters in an audio message. ""It is the nature of war.""
Many of those captured have been released quickly, but others have been kept as hostages as the rebels demand the release of arrested Rakhine civilians.
After the Nov. 3 attack, in which one of the Indians was killed, the rebels quickly freed most of the hostages. But they kept the NLD lawmaker, Hawi Tin, in custody.
In a statement, the rebels accused Hawi Tin of informing authorities about their activities.
One man aboard the boat that was seized in October said he had been taking his family on holiday. They were released after 10 days and a lengthy interrogation.
""I did not even hope to survive – I was thinking of God,"" he said. ""I feel really grateful to be alive right now."" 
The man, who requested anonymity, said he was taken into the jungle and kept in a hut, guarded by two armed rebels.
The abductions have sparked an outcry from rights groups over the toll the fighting is taking on civilians. More than 40,000 people have fled their homes as fighting has escalated over the past year, according to the United Nations, and dozens have been killed.
A U.N investigator said in July the army may be committing ""war crimes"" in the region, citing reports of deaths during interrogations of people arrested over suspected links to the rebels. 
The rebels enjoy strong support across Rakhine, where many people feel that the central government has neglected the region economically.
The rebels' leader, Tun Myat Naing, has called for ""confederate"" status for Rakhine, which would mean autonomy from the rest of Myanmar and include authority over legislation and taxation.
ETHNIC CONFLICT
There are indications the conflict is exacerbating existing tensions between the myriad ethnic groups coexisting uneasily in Rakhine.
Rohingya Muslims, hundreds of thousands of whom remain in Rakhine, have been caught between both sides, with some reported killed by the group as suspected informers.
""If one is not with them, then he is their enemy,"" said Aye Chan, a Yangon-based historian from Rakhine, referring to the rebels. 
Hawi Tin, the kidnapped lawmaker, hails from the Chin ethnic minority, some of whom are Christian and have a historic rivalry with Buddhist Rakhines.
The Chin Human Rights Organization says a total of 13 Chin people are being held by the Arakan Army. Reuters was not able to independently confirm that claim.
One Chin official from Paletwa, the same town as Hawi Tin, said he was detained for five days by the rebels and beaten. The official, who requested anonymity, said he had been accused of feeding information about the group's activities to the police and military.
In Paletwa, fears are growing for Hawi Tin's safety.
""I don't know what to tell the kids when they ask about their father,"" Hawi Tin's wife, Khin Ei Sint, said by telephone.

""I just want the government to rescue him and help return him home,"" she said.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran lawmakers allied with President Juan Orlando Hernandez have voted against renewing an agreement with the Organization of American States (OAS) to extend the mandate of an anti-corruption body.
The Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH), which was formed in 2016 and has tackled public graft and illicit campaign financing, will end its term in January 2020 if Hernandez does not renew its mandate with the OAS.
On Tuesday evening, 70 lawmakers of a total of 128 in the single-chamber Congress, most of them from Hernandez's party, voted in favor of a petition to end the mandate. The petition said MACCIH officials ""violated rights, guarantees and constitutional principles.""
One complaint put forward by lawmakers is that MACCIH has revealed the names of people it is investigating while the cases are still pending, and that is has illegally obtained official documents.
The vote is non-binding. Most Hondurans support the work MACCIH is doing, according to a recent poll.
MACCIH has presented 12 corruption cases. Its work led to a 58-year prison sentence for former first lady Rosa Elena Bonilla, the wife of former President Porfirio Lobo, for fraud and misappropriation of funds.
Lobo himself is also under investigation for alleged money laundering, and lawmakers have also been investigated by the MACCIH."

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States is ready ""to simultaneously take concrete steps"" toward a deal aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs, but the Security Council must be prepared to respond to any provocations, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations said on Wednesday. 
The 15-member Security Council met on Wednesday at the request of the United States as concerns grow internationally that North Korea could resume nuclear or long-range missile testing - suspended since 2017 - because denuclearization talks between Pyongyang and Washington have stalled.
""We remain ready to take actions in parallel, and to simultaneously take concrete steps toward this agreement. We are prepared to be flexible in how we approach this matter,"" U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft said. ""And we recognize the need for a balanced agreement that addresses the concerns of all parties."" 
But she added that North Korea needed to make ""the difficult, but bold decision"" to work with the United States.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has given U.S. President Donald Trump until the end of 2019 to show flexibility. North Korea's U.N. ambassador, Kim Song, declared on Saturday, however, that denuclearization was off the table.
Trump then warned that Kim risked losing ""everything"" if he resumes hostility and that North Korea must denuclearize. Trump and Kim have met three times since June 2018, but no progress toward a deal has been made. 
Craft said that the Security Council must be ready to ""act accordingly"" if North Korea follows through on its public hints that it could resume ""serious provocations."" 
""In practical terms, this would mean that the DPRK could launch space vehicles using long-range ballistic missile technology, or that they could even test-launch intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are designed to attack the continental United States with nuclear weapons,"" Craft said. 
She gave no details on possible Security Council action.
'IMPERATIVE' THAT SANCTIONS EASED 
North Korean allies China and Russia - which are U.N. Security Council veto powers along with France, Britain and the United States - have long said the council should reward Pyongyang after Kim pledged in 2018 to work toward denuclearization. 
North Korea has been subject to U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs. 
China's U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, said on Wednesday that it was ""imperative"" that the Security Council ease sanctions on North Korea in a bid to support talks between Pyongyang and Washington and ""head off a dramatic reversal"" of the situation. 
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said North Korea's nuclear and missile programs were ""unacceptable"" but that progress in talks could not be made when Pyongyang is ""told to unequivocally agree to all conditions that are imposed for the promise of future benefits."" 
""It's impossible to agree on something without offering something in return,"" he said. ""It's essential to have a road map of a step-by-step lifting of restrictions."" 
French U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said the current situation ""in no way justifies lifting the sanctions or using a lighter hand in their implementation."" British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce echoed his remarks. 
At least eight Security Council members had been pushing for a meeting on human rights abuses in North Korea, sparking Pyongyang to warn it would consider such a move a ""serious provocation"" to which it would ""respond strongly."" Diplomats said such a meeting would have prompted China to call a vote to try to stop it, even though it would not have enough support. 

But the United States, which is president of the Security Council for December, decided to convene the meeting on Wednesday to focus instead on the threat of escalation by North Korea.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - About 70 soldiers were killed in an attack on a remote military camp in Niger near the border with Mali on Tuesday evening, four security sources told Reuters, in the deadliest raid against the Nigerien military in living memory. 
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the assault. But Islamist militants with links to Islamic State and al Qaeda have mounted increasingly lethal attacks across West Africa's Sahel region this year despite the commitment of thousands of regional and foreign troops to counter them. 
The violence has hit Mali and Burkina Faso the hardest but has also spilled over into Niger, which shares long and porous borders with its two neighbors. 
Tuesday's attack struck a base in the western Niger town of Inates, the sources said, in the same area where Islamic State’s West African branch killed nearly 50 Nigerien soldiers in two attacks in May and July. 
Two of the sources said another 30 soldiers had been wounded and that the military base had been taken over by the assailants. 
Nigerien authorities were not immediately available to comment and details on the attack were limited. 
President Mahamadou Issoufou's office tweeted that Issoufou had cut short a visit to Egypt in order to return to Niger ""following the tragedy that occurred in Inates"". 
Security has deteriorated this year across the Sahel, a semi-arid strip of land beneath the Sahara, due to jihadist attacks and deadly ethnic reprisals between rival farming and herding communities. 
The region has been in crisis since 2012, when ethnic Tuareg rebels and loosely-aligned jihadists seized the northern two-thirds of Mali, forcing France to intervene the following year to beat them back. But the jihadists have since regrouped and expanded their range of influence. 
The rising body count this year has inflamed popular anger against regional governments and former colonial master France, which has 4,500 troops deployed across the Sahel.
French President Emmanuel Macron, frustrated by mounting anti-French sentiment, particularly in the wake of a helicopter accident in Mali last month that killed 13 French troops, has invited five West African leaders to a meeting next week, where he plans to ask them to clarify whether they want French troops to remain in their countries. 
Some of the countries, who participate in the French-backed G5 Sahel military force, have reacted coolly to what they see as an ultimatum from Paris. 
Malian government spokesman Yaya Sangare said on Wednesday that President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita would attend next Monday's meeting in southwestern France ""under conditions"" transmitted to France's envoy to the Sahel.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish authorities said on Wednesday they are considering giving residency to an undocumented migrant from Senegal after he rescued a wheelchair-bound man from a burning, second-story apartment.
Street vendor Gorgui Lamine Sow was walking the streets of the coastal city of Denia on Friday when he heard screams coming from nearby.
He rushed over to a crowd watching black smoke pouring out of a second floor window. ""They told me there was a man trapped inside the apartment,"" the 20-year-old told Reuters. ""I didn't think about it. I just dropped my things and started climbing.""
He scaled the balcony, entering the burning apartment as smoke filled the street. Once inside he hoisted the resident over his shoulders and carried him down a ladder set up by a neighbor.
Local media identified the victim as 39-year-old Alex Caudeli Webster.
""If Gorgui had not pulled Alex to safety when he did then Alex would not have survived,"" neighbor Roberta Etter said. ""Gorgui literally saved his life.""
As emergency officials neared the scene, the rescuer panicked. ""If the police saw me they would confiscate my goods,"" said Sow, who lives with his girlfriend and seven-month-old daughter in the nearby city of Gandia. ""And if they take them from me, we're not eating tomorrow.""
After ensuring the man he had rescued was okay, he picked up the bracelets and necklaces he was selling and left the scene.
The story of the dramatic rescue made waves across the country, drawing comparisons with the migrant from Mali who last year scaled a Paris apartment block to save a boy dangling from a fourth-floor balcony.
Others depicted Sow as a counterpoint to the anti-immigrant messaging being pushed by far-right party Vox, which surged to third place in parliament in last month's national elections.
Sow found out days later that neighbors were hailing him as a hero. ""I'm just happy that the man is fine,"" he said, adding that the man he rescued was treated for burns and smoke inhalation.
As news spread of the rescue, local authorities urged the central government to consider giving him residency. A source with the government delegation in Valencia confirmed they are studying his case.
Residency would make life much easier, said Sow, who arrived in Spain in 2017, allowing him the chance to find work besides selling goods on the street.
""There are people who, when I try to show them stuff, they don't look at me, they won't talk to me,"" he said. ""It's really difficult to do this job."""

KABUL (Reuters) - Suicide bombers struck the main U.S. military base in Afghanistan on Wednesday, killing two people and injuring scores in a major attack that could scupper plans to revive peace talks between the United States and the Taliban.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which struck the Bagram air base north of Kabul. 
""First, a heavy-duty Mazda vehicle struck the wall of the American base,"" said Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman. ""Later several mujahideen equipped with light and heavy weapons were able to attack the American occupiers."" 
The U.S.-led military coalition said the attack was ""quickly contained and repelled."" Taliban fighters who unsuccessfully tried to breach the airfield were killed in a series of airstrikes, the Resolute Support mission said in a statement.
Two civilians were killed and more than 70 injured during the attack, the Ministry of the Interior said.
Five servicemen from the former Soviet republic of Georgia, which is part of the coalition, were among those injured, the country's defense ministry said in a statement. The majority of casualties were Afghan.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking at a news conference, condemned the attack that he said wounded at least five coalition troops.
""A 30-minute clash also happened between the attackers, who obviously wanted to enter the base, and foreign forces,"" said Wahida Shahkar, a spokeswoman for the governor of Parwan province, which includes the Bagram district.
Two attackers detonated vehicles laden with explosives at the southern entrance to the base, while five more opened fire. Some of the fighters barricaded themselves inside a medical facility they had attacked, the coalition of foreign forces in Afghanistan said in a statement. 

U.S. President Donald Trump called off talks with the Taliban in September after an attack by the group killed an American soldier. The Taliban controls more territory than at any point since being ousted from power by Afghan foes with U.S. air support in 2001.

The lawyer, Sophie Thonon-Wesfreid, told Reuters he was arrested just hours after France's top administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, rejected Sandoval's appeal against his extradition. He was being held near Paris.
Sandoval, who moved to France after the fall of Argentina's seven-year military dictatorship and obtained French citizenship in 1997, is accused by Argentine prosecutors of more than 600 human rights violations including torture.
A former federal police officer, he is accused of committing crimes at a secret prison where he was a specialist in fighting what the military called ""subversive elements"". He denies the charges.
As many as 30,000 people were murdered in Argentina during the 1976-1983 dictatorship's so-called Dirty War against suspected leftists and political dissidents, according to human rights groups.
Sandoval's attorney was not immediately available for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - This week's deadly attack on a New Jersey kosher grocery store does not appear to be an act of organized terrorism in the eyes of U.S. federal investigators, a law enforcement source said on Wednesday.
Six people, including the two shooters, three civilians and a police officer, died in a series of events that ended in a police shootout on Tuesday in Jersey City, New Jersey. Authorities are still in the early stages of investigating what set off the shooting.
The four-hour gun battle at the Jewish JC Kosher Supermarket erupted after the pair shot the police officer at a nearby cemetery and then fled in a white van.
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop told reporters the attacker targeted the grocery. Fulop ordered police to be on high alert to protect Jewish neighborhoods following the attack.
But the federal law enforcement source said investigators believe mental illness and drug use may have been the primary factors in the attack. He said investigators now view an anti-Semitic message posted online as a secondary factor.
Jersey City Public Safety Director James Shea told a morning news conference: ""With the amount of ammunition they had, we have to assume they would have continued attacking human beings if we hadn't been there.""
He did not comment on why the grocery was targeted but said the shooters appeared to choose it rather than other people or locations on the street. Police declined to release the names or genders of the shooters, but the federal law enforcement source said both were black.
Some local media reported the initial confrontation between the suspects and police near the Jersey City cemetery, about a mile away from the supermarket, was linked to a previous homicide investigation.

The dead police officer was shot at the cemetery shortly before the shootout around the grocery began.

What do a donut, a digger, a pair of boxing gloves and a knitted scarf have in common?
All have been printed, painted, woven or iced with the Conservative election slogan ""Get Brexit Done"" during Johnson's six-week tour around the country.
It is not unusual for political parties to come up with one or two central campaign messages and then plaster them across lecterns, placards and buses.
But while Labour's ""Time for real change"" and ""For the many, not the few"" slogans have appeared in the usual places, Johnson's Conservatives have gone to greater lengths to try and ensure their message gets through to voters.
On Wednesday's whistle-stop final day of campaigning Johnson added a few more to the list: a branded apron worn while making a pie and a milk crate used to make an early morning delivery to a voter's house.
""STONG"" CAMPAIGN LITERATURE
Much of the 2019 general election campaign has been fought online with targeted adverts, viral videos and even party-political 'fact checking' services.
But for each party's band of campaigners on the ground, little has changed: getting a local candidate elected means knocking on doors and posting leaflets through letterboxes.
When the digital meets the real world, though, the result is not always as intended.
A photo of one leaflet went viral when posted on Twitter because it showed a candidate promising to invest in ""insulting"" rather than insulating every home.
Another victim of the mailshot misprint was senior Conservative minister Michael Gove, who racked up unwanted retweets and likes when a recipient of his campaign literature posted a typo in the leaflet's tag line: ""A Stong Local Voice""
WARM-UP ACT
Campaigning for Britain's first December election in nearly 100 years has often been a cold and wet affair, overshadowing the run-up to Christmas celebrations.
But, in a cold car park in northern England on Wednesday, Labour's transport spokesman Andy McDonald tried to warm up the crowd waiting for party leader Jeremy Corbyn with a little Christmas cheer.
Taking the stage, McDonald performed a reworking of the seasonal classic ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"", popularized by Bing Crosby in 1951.
To loud cheers he crooned:
""It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Lots of ho ho ho,
But the prettiest sight to see,
Will be Jeremy by the tree,
By Number 10's front door."""

BERN (Reuters) - A humanitarian channel to bring food and medicine to Iran could be up and running within months, senior Swiss and U.S. officials told Reuters, helping supply Swiss goods to the struggling population without tripping over U.S. sanctions.
Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from sanctions that Washington reimposed last year after U.S. President Donald Trump walked away from a 2015 international deal over Iran's nuclear program. 
But the U.S. measures targeting everything from oil sales to shipping and financial activities have deterred several foreign banks from doing business with the Islamic Republic - including humanitarian deals - just as Iran grapples with major protests.
Pascale Baeriswyl, Swiss state secretary for foreign affairs, and U.S. Ambassador Edward McMullen spoke in separate interviews in the Swiss capital late on Tuesday, days after a rare Swiss-brokered prisoner swap by arch foes Iran and the United States.
""Our role is really to be able to provide food and health goods to the Iranian people. And therefore we are working hard on establishing that humanitarian channel,"" Baeriswyl said.
U.S. clarifications announced in October on how to verify and certify such deals - bypassing Iran's central bank and ensuring that no payments are transferred to Iran - helped advance the project so as to safeguard Swiss exporters. 
""Ultimately that depends on companies and banks wanting to participate....We have made progress recently,"" Baeriswyl said.
Asked whether the mechanism could be operational in the first half of 2020, she replied: ""I hope so, but it is very difficult to predict since it is not entirely in our hands.""
McMullen was also upbeat. ""Fortunately, I think we are at that point now where we are working with Switzerland on the final details. And hopefully we'll be seeing some kind of finality to that conversation in the near future,"" he said.
To be sure, big Swiss companies like Nestle and drugmakers Roche and Novartis already produce in Iran. The new channel could encourage smaller players to export food and medicine to Iran. 
France has led efforts for more than a year to set up a separate European trade mechanism for humanitarian and food goods with Iran, which has stalled. 
Baeriswyl said: ""If this (Swiss) model works it would be great if others could follow... It's not a competing instrument, just a slightly different approach.""
January marks the 40th anniversary of Switzerland's taking on a mandate of a neutral ""protecting power"", representing U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran since Washington and Tehran cut ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution. 
Baeriswyl, who held talks in Geneva with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in October that were revealed in Twitter posts, met him again in Zurich last weekend for the handover of U.S. and Iranian prisoners. 

""We stand ready - if both parties ask us to - to facilitate more (exchanges), of course,"" she said.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 12:07PM ET</span>",Austrian parliament suspends deportations of asylum seekers in apprenticeships,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill suspending deportations of asylum seekers while they are carrying out apprenticeships, countering the previous right-wing government's hard line on immigration.
Austria currently has a provisional government of civil servants that will be in place until a ruling coalition is formed. Conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz, who won the last parliamentary election, are in coalition talks with the Greens.
A central tenet of Kurz's previous coalition with the far-right Freedom Party was clamping down on illegal immigration and cutting benefits for new legal arrivals.
That proved popular in the wake of a European migration crisis in which Austria took in more than 1% of its population in asylum seekers. But more recent cases of well integrated asylum seekers working as apprentices and facing imminent deportation have generated public sympathy.
""These apprentices about whom we are speaking today, they have a deficiency in the eyes of our last government, namely they came to Austria as asylum seekers,"" Greens lawmaker Alma Zadic told the lower house of parliament during the debate on the bill.
Zadic is also a negotiator in the coalition talks, underlining the stark policy differences between the left-wing Greens and Kurz's People's Party (OVP) on immigration.
""These apprentices do excellent work. They are super-integrated, they support our businesses,"" said Zadic, whose rhetoric contrasted sharply with that of Kurz and his party, which often portray immigration as a burden and a threat.
Asylum seekers were allowed to start apprenticeships until September of last year, but only in areas where there is a labor shortage and no other suitable candidates for the position. There are currently around 800 asylum seekers in apprenticeships, many in the hospitality industry.
The bill was backed by the Social Democrats, the Greens, the liberal Neos and the OVP. The Freedom Party opposed it.
But the OVP has said that apprenticeships should not offer a ""back door"" to asylum."

TORONTO (Reuters) - Multiple people were killed when a small plane crashed on Gabriola Island in British Columbia on Tuesday evening, authorities said.
The calls came in around 6:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrived on scene to find multiple fatalities from the crash on the northwest corner of the island, which is just east of the larger Vancouver Island and has a population of about 4,000 people.
Coroners and transportation investigators were headed to the site on Wednesday. The B.C. Coroners Service ""is in the preliminary stages of its fact-finding investigation to determine who died, and how, where, when and by what means the deceased came to their sudden, unexpected deaths,"" according to a statement from spokesman Andy Watson.
The Transportation Safety Board confirmed on Wednesday morning that three investigators were due on-site later in the day. Authorities could not immediately confirm the number of fatalities or what had caused the crash."

PARIS (Reuters) - France's prime minister said on Wednesday its people should work two years longer to get a full pension, drawing a hostile response from trade unions who said they would step up strike action to force an about-turn.
In a speech that followed days of protests and industrial action, Edouard Philippe outlined an overhaul of France's byzantine pension system that he said would be fairer and plug a gaping deficit in the pension budget.
The legal retirement age would remain at 62, Philippe said, but workers would be encouraged to work until 64 through a system of bonuses and discounts. That would allow a balanced pension budget by 2027, he said.
The reform-minded CFDT union, which has hitherto stayed out of the strikes, said a ""red line"" had been crossed. Hardline unions showed no sign of backing down in a battle of political will that could make or break Emmanuel Macron's presidency.
One union leader called the plan ""a joke"".
""The time has come to build a universal pension system,"" Philippe said in a much-anticipated speech. ""I am determined to see this reform through because I believe it to be fair."" 
Defying union anger, Philippe said France would replace a convoluted system of more than 42 separate state-funded plans with a universal, points-based system that will apply to those entering the job market for the first time in 2022.
He showed some flexibility to unions over the timing, saying anyone within 17 years of retirement would be exempt - a longer period than the five years initially envisaged.
There would be a minimum pension of 1,000 euros ($1,102) per month for those who worked a full career.
Reform of France's pension system, which offers some of the most generous benefits in the industrialized world, has proven a treacherous task for past and present governments. 
Macron and his government will hope to create tangible benefits under a universal, points-based system to divide those under the new regime from those who refuse to let go of old privileges, some of which date back centuries, analysts said.
But if the unions are able to draw more people out of the workplace, the strike which has crippled the transport network, closed schools and forced the cancellation of some flights could run for days, or longer. 
""RED LINE"" CROSSED
The hard-left CGT union accused the prime minister of turning a deaf ear to the strikers.
""We're not at all happy,"" CGT leader Philippe Martinez told LCI television. ""It is a joke.""
A Martinez deputy told Reuters the conditions were in place for the strike to harden. 
The moderate CFDT union said a ""red line had been crossed"" by setting 64 as the average age needed for a balanced pension budget, making it a de facto new retirement age. 
The strongest opposition to the planned reform has come from workers with 'special benefit' plans, including rail employees, dockers and Paris Opera singers who are entitled to retire on a full pension years before the average retirement age of 62. 
Philippe said a universal, points-based system would be fairer, giving every pensioner the same rights for each euro contributed, and enable workers to move more freely from one job to another in the modern-day labor market.
""We know our children won't have the same linear careers we had and we need a pension system that allows that.""

Philippe said that under the new system, every hour worked will earn pension rights, which will benefit gig economy workers such as bicycle couriers and office cleaners, who often do not earn enough to lock in pension rights under the current system.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 11:28AM ET</span>",New Finland leader: 'silent blessing' given to bring home Islamic State kids,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's new prime minister said on Wednesday the center-left coalition government had given its ""silent blessing"" to the Foreign Minister to go ahead with plans to repatriate children of women who traveled to Syria to join Islamic State.
The remarks by Prime Minister Sanna Marin, a day after she took office, could set the stage for a conflict within her five member center-left coalition, which has yet to agree a position on the issue of repatriations.
The coalition's second biggest party, the Centre Party, which toppled Marin's predecessor last week, has so far withheld support for the Foreign Ministry's plans.
Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he had nominated a special envoy to look into how more than 30 Finnish children currently trapped at the Al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria could be brought home.
""(Our) guidelines include the idea that at least the children could be brought to safety from the camp within a reasonable timeframe,"" Haavisto told reporters, adding that it was not clear how quickly that could take place.
The Red Cross says around 68,000 people are being held in Al-Hol, mostly the family members of defeated Islamic State fighters, two thirds of them children. Finland is one of many EU countries trying to decide what to do about their citizens. 
Haavisto said Syrian Kurdish forces, who have kept the Islamic State fighters and their families under custody at camps since they took the jihadist group's last enclave, were opposed to the idea of separating children from their mothers.
""If separating a child from their guardian is not legally or factually possible, the premise is that the child's interest is decisive,"" he said.
Haavisto has come under heavy political pressure in recent weeks for his active approach in trying to bring the children back to Finland.
The Centre Party has been frightened by the rapid rise in polls of the opposition nationalist Finns Party, which says repatriating Islamic State detainees could endanger Finland's security.

Marin took office on Tuesday after the Centre Party withdrew its support from Social Democrat leader Antti Rinne last week, forcing him to step down as prime minister. At 34, Marin is the world's youngest national leader. All five coalition leaders in the cabinet are women, four of them under 35.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A senior U.S. military official said on Wednesday attacks by Iranian-backed groups on bases hosting U.S. forces in Iraq were gathering pace and becoming more sophisticated, pushing all sides closer to an uncontrollable escalation.
His warning came two days after four Katyusha rockets struck a base near Baghdad international airport, wounding five members of Iraq's elite Counter-Terrorism Service.
It was the latest in a spate of rocket strikes in the past five weeks on military installations hosting members of the U.S.-led coalition whose objective is to defeat Islamic State insurgents. The official said the attacks were jeopardizing the coalition's ability to combat Islamic State insurgents.
Tension between the United States and Iran has ramped up in the region over U.S. economic sanctions that are hitting Tehran hard. The two sides have traded blame over attacks on oil installations, militia arms depots as well as military bases hosting U.S. forces.
""We're used to harassing fire,"" said the military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""But the pace of (that) was (previously) pretty episodic ... (Now) the level of complexity is increasing, the volume of rockets being shot in a single volley is increasing and is very concerning to us.""
The official added: ""There is a point at which their actions change things on the ground and make it more likely that some other actions, some other choices made – by somebody, whether it's them or us – will escalate unintentionally.""
The military official said Iranian-armed militias were approaching a red line where the coalition would respond with force, and ""no one will like the outcome"".
There have been no claims of responsibility for any of the attacks. However the U.S. military official said intelligence and forensic analyses of the rockets and launchers pointed to Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim militia groups, notably Kataib Hezbollah and Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH).
Iraqi paramilitary groups have in turn accused the United States and Israel of bombing their weapons depots and bases.
Most of Iraq's Shi'ite militia groups are part of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella that has allies in parliament and government. They report to the prime minister but have their own command structure outside the military.
The military official said Iraq's Shi'ite-led government had not taken action over the incidents. ""It's very concerning to me...That it's acceptable that we're getting attacked by elements that are supposedly being brought in under the heel of the Iraqi government as part of its security forces.""
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned last month under pressure from mass anti-government protests. He is currently carrying out his duties in a caretaker capacity.
Militia groups used a converted flatbed truck to launch a barrage of 17 rockets on the Qayyara military base south of Mosul on Nov. 8, the U.S. military official said.
He said the incident caused no major damage or loss of life, but the technique was replicated in attacks on both Balad and Ain Al-Asad air bases last week, using rockets large enough to cause significant damage to living compounds and runways at Ain Al-Asad.
Friday's attack near Baghdad airport was with significantly larger 240-millimeter rockets not known to have been used in Iraq since 2011."

Greece last week expelled the Libyan ambassador in response to the agreement, infuriated at a pact which skirts the Greek island of Crete and infringes, in Athens's view, its continental shelf.
""The Turkey-Libya memorandum of understanding on the delimitation of maritime jurisdictions in the Mediterranean Sea infringes upon the sovereign rights of third States (and) does not comply with the (U.N.) Law of the Sea,"" EU leaders will say, according to the draft statement prepared for a two-day summit from Thursday.
The deal between Ankara and Tripoli carves out a slanting sea corridor of maritime boundaries at the closest points between Libya and Turkey, potentially clearing the way for oil and gas search there.
""The European Council unequivocally reaffirms its solidarity with Greece and Cyprus regarding these actions by Turkey,"" the draft said.
Greece has lodged its objections to the United Nations over the accord between Libya and Turkey, saying the pact could affect implementation of the Libyan agreement brokered by the UN in 2015 to end years of fighting in the North African country.
A row over eastern Mediterranean gas reserves offshore has become increasingly shrill with countries in the region jostling to stake their claims. Turkey has a long-running disagreement with ethnically split Cyprus over reserves around that island."

Thunberg launched a grassroots campaign aged 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside Swedish parliament, pushing for her government to meet its ambitious goals to curb carbon emissions.
Her actions quickly captured people's imagination, and in September this year millions of people took to the streets in cities across the world to support her cause.
""In the 16 months since (her protests began), she has addressed heads of state at the U.N., met with the Pope, sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike,"" the magazine said.
She is the youngest individual to have won the accolade.
""Margaret Atwood compared her to Joan of Arc. After noticing a hundredfold increase in its usage, lexicographers at Collins Dictionary named Thunberg’s pioneering idea, climate strike, the word of the year,"" Time added.
Thunberg, who turns 17 in January, is currently in Madrid at a United Nations climate summit where world leaders are wrangling over how to implement a 2015 Paris agreement designed to avert potentially catastrophic global warming.
She was typically blunt in her assessment of politicians' efforts.
""It seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition,"" she said on stage, drawing applause from an audience that included dozens of her supporters.
""I'm sure that if people heard what was going on and what was said ... during these meetings, they would be outraged.""
Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, a longtime environmentalist, said the magazine made a ""brilliant choice"" in choosing the reluctant celebrity.
""Greta embodies the moral authority of the youth activist movement demanding that we act immediately to solve the climate crisis. She is an inspiration to me and to people across the world,"" Gore said.
'HOW DARE YOU?'
Thunberg, who said her Asperger's syndrome can be an advantage in her campaigning, sailed across the Atlantic Ocean for 20 days to get to the Madrid event in order to avoid traveling by air.
""Flight-shaming"" has gained momentum, especially in Europe, where some travelers concerned about the environmental impact of flying are seeking alternative forms of transport.
Thunberg's uncompromising stance has brought her into confrontation with some of the world's most powerful people.
A video of her giving U.S. President Donald Trump what media described as a ""death stare"" at a U.N. climate summit in New York in September went viral on social media.
Trump has questioned climate science and has challenged every major U.S. regulation aimed at combating climate change.
During a speech at around the same time, she bristled with anger.
""This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?"" she told delegates.
""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.""
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro this week called Thunberg a ""brat"" after she criticized mounting violence against indigenous people in which two Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) tribesmen were shot dead.

The activist retorted by changing the biographical description on her Twitter account to ""Pirralha,"" the Portuguese word Bolsonaro used to insult her.

670,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>",Nobel-winning author Handke declared 'persona non grata' in Sarajevo,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - The Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Wednesday declared Nobel Prize-winning Austrian author Peter Handke ""persona non grata"" over his support for late Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and denial of the 1995 genocide in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica.
Sarajevo endured a 43-month siege by nationalist Bosnian Serb forces armed by Milosevic during a 1992-95 war following Bosnia's secession from Serbian-led Yugoslavia. About 11,000 people died in the siege, at least 10 percent children, and more than 100,000 overall in the war.
The Sarajevo cantonal assembly unanimously adopted a declaration on Wednesday proclaiming Handke unwelcome after he said in a recent interview that he might visit post-war Bosnia's autonomous Serb region next year.
""His possible visit to our homeland ... would prompt additional rage and humiliation of all victims,"" read the declaration, which condemned awarding what it called a ""genocide denier"" this year's Nobel Literature Prize.
Reflecting enduring ethnic divisions in Bosnia, Igor Radojicic, mayor of the Serb entity's de facto capital Banja Luka, congratulated Handke and invited him to visit. Nationalist Serbs see Handke as a campaigner for their cause. 
Sarajevo authorities could not prevent Handke visiting Serb Republic territory, though the declaration would allow them to bar him entry to Bosnia via the capital.
Bosnian Muslims and especially relatives of the 8,000 Muslim men and boys massacred by Serb forces in Srebrenica, Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two, were outraged at the news that the Nobel Committee had honored Handke. Other Balkan countries also criticized the decision.
The Swedish Academy's choice of Handke drew widespread criticism as the Austrian novelist and playwright spoke at the funeral of Milosevic in 2006 after the Serbian leader died in detention in The Hague while facing trial for war crimes.
Handke has dismissed questions about his support for Milosevic.

Hundreds of people protested on Tuesday in Stockholm against Handke's Nobel Prize. The ambassadors of Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Turkey boycotted the award ceremony.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's new executive launched a Green Deal policy package to tackle climate change on Wednesday, trumpeting it as the bloc's ""man on the moon moment"" - but fossil fuel-reliant eastern European states looked set to stall the initiative.
European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen's first major proposal since taking office on Dec. 1 will commit the EU to achieving climate neutrality, emitting no more greenhouse gases beyond what can be absorbed, by 2050.
Her proposal will feed into a discussion on Thursday among leaders of member states. But Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were already objecting to a draft summit decision on the issue, according to diplomats and documents.
""Today is the start of a journey. But this is Europe's man on the moon moment,"" von der Leyen told journalists before taking her climate pitch to the European Parliament.
""The European Green Deal is very ambitious, but it will also be very careful in assessing the impact and every single step we are taking,"" she said.
Global anxiety has mounted in recent months after heat waves, droughts and wildfires that scientists say have been exacerbated by rising temperatures.
The European Commission will propose in March 2020 new laws to make the EU climate neutral by 2050. It will also propose by mid-2020 more ambitious targets to cut emissions by 2030 from the current 40% target to ""at least"" 50%, according to the document published on Wednesday. 
One major component is a so-called Just Transition Fund, a mechanism of at least 35 billion euros that would support ""regions most exposed to decarbonization challenge"".
Von der Leyen said the Commission wants to mobilize 100 billion euros worth of investment to help the bloc's economies pay for transition away from fossil fuels. To make the rest of the world follow suit, there would be a carbon border tax, essentially tariffs on imported polluting goods. 
SUMMIT SHOWDOWN LOOMS
Friends of the Earth Europe said the Green Deal marked a shift in tone but did not go far enough. 
""Finally, the EU is waking up to rising public concern about the planetary emergency,"" said Jagoda Munic, director of the environmental NGO. 
""However, the promises are too small, too few, and too far off – we're on a runaway train to ecological and climate collapse and the EU Commission is gently switching gears instead of slamming on the brakes.""
The 2050 climate neutrality goal will be one of the main issues EU leaders tackle at their Thursday-Friday summit. 
All members except Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary have signed up to the goal.
The holdouts have stopped the EU from leading the charge in the global fight against climate change during the past year, as the goal requires unanimous support.
""The Czech Republic also wants to reach carbon neutrality, but we won't make it without nuclear,"" Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Twitter. 
""The EU must recognize nuclear as emission-free source. On the top of that, the costs of carbon neutrality will be huge.""
Asked ahead of the summit what it would take to get the holdouts to come on board, a senior EU diplomat grinned and made the gesture for money with his fingers.

Separately, in a setback for the bloc's climate ambitions, EU states on Wednesday rejected a deal on a set of rules governing which financial products can be called ""green"" and ""sustainable"", an EU official said.

Andres Chadwick, a cousin and close confidant of center-right President Sebastian Pinera, was ousted by the president shortly after protests began in October, part of a cabinet reshuffle designed to quell increasingly violent riots.
Opposition lawmakers in Chile's lower house nonetheless moved to censure Chadwick in late November for his alleged role in human rights abuses during the first, and most violent, week of unrest.
Nearly two months of protests over inequality and social injustice have since left at least 26 dead, billions in damages and thousands of injuries in the once-stable South American nation.
International rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have ratcheted up pressure on President Sebastian Pinera's administration for its handling of the crisis, citing abuses by police ranging from rape to torture.
If the censure motion is approved by a majority of senators on Wednesday, Chadwick would be forbidden from serving in public office for five years.
Chadwick, himself a former lawmaker, told many of his former colleagues in the Senate late Tuesday he was innocent of the charges.
""Never in my time as interior minister have I taken any action or measure, deliberate or otherwise, to permit the abuse of the human rights of any individual,"" Chadwick said.
The lower house of Congress will begin a debate to impeach Pinera over similar charges on Thursday.
Pinera has acknowledged some abuses by security forces and promised investigations and deep reforms to police protocols. But both Pinera and his ministers have repeatedly denied that they deliberately facilitated the violations."

The special envoy, Mauricio Claver-Carone, told local newspaper Clarin that he had left early after being ""surprised"" at the presence of guests including Venezuelan Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez.
The comments were confirmed by a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy, who said no scheduled meetings had been canceled. 
The United States and many Western nations have called for Maduro to step down and have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's legitimate president.
Peronist leader Fernandez faces a diplomatic juggling act between the United States and leftist allies including Venezuela. His vice president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, was close with Maduro at the end of her 2007-2015 twin terms.
""Unfortunately, due to some invitations and some surprises we received upon arrival, I decided not to go and I am leaving early. I will not have the work meetings I had scheduled for tomorrow,"" Claver-Carone told Clarin.
The envoy said that ties with Maduro ""do not bring any benefits to Argentina,"" which he said should focus on ""how they can work bilaterally with us and with other allies.""
Other U.S. officials did still attend and meet with Fernandez, including U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar and Michael Kozak, the U.S. acting assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.
The U.S. Embassy spokesman said on Wednesday that Azar and Claver-Carone had now left Argentina, while Kozak remained.
Argentine's former conservative leader, Mauricio Macri, who handed over power to Fernandez on Tuesday, had been a close ally of the United States over Venezuela.
Fernandez has been cautious with his stance over the Maduro government though he has emphasized ties with other leftist politicians in the region including Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Bolivia's unseated leader, Evo Morales, and former Brazilian leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Cuban leader Miguel Díaz-Canel and Ecuador's former president, Rafael Correa, were also present at the inauguration, while Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro did not attend, instead sending his vice president.
Argentina, which received a $57 billion credit facility from the International Monetary Fund last year, will hope to receive U.S. support as it looks to restructure a large debt pile amid an economic crisis and credit default fears.

The Hercules C-130 cargo plane disappeared shortly after taking off late on Monday from the southern city of Punta Arenas. The Air Force concluded the aircraft must have crashed early the next morning, given the number of hours it had been missing.
The cause of the crash was not known and officials acknowledged the chances of finding survivors were slim.
Large rolling waves in the icy Drake Passage and low clouds had complicated the search on Tuesday, authorities said.
Airforce general Eduardo Mosqueira, who leads the search effort, told reporters early on Wednesday that the search area would be expanded for at least the next six days.
""We could add four days and bring this to 10 days, but after that we would need to decide whether or not to continue,"" Mosqueira said.
The flight appeared routine until the moment it disappeared, Mosqueira said.
The region where the plane disappeared is a vast, largely untouched ocean wilderness of penguin-inhabited ice sheets off the edge of the South American continent with depths of 3,500 meters (11,500 feet).
The military was using sonar-enabled Navy ships to detect irregularities at depth, and that it had established quadrangles to help organize the search, Mosqueira said. Ships from Argentina and Brazil were assisting, he said."
675,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 09:24AM ET</span>",Special Report: Icebound - The climate-change secrets of 19th century ship's logbooks,"By Andrew R.C. Marshall
OXFORD, England (Reuters) - On November 14, 1881, an American called George Melville limped across a frozen delta in Siberia and pulled a pole from the snow with his frost-bitten hands.
Exhausted and half-starving, Melville was scouring the wasteland for fellow survivors of the most famous ship in the world. The USS Jeannette had set sail from San Francisco to conquer the North Pole. Instead, it quickly got trapped in ice and spent nearly two years drifting across the Arctic Ocean, lost to the rest of humanity.
When it was finally crushed by the ice, the Jeannette's 33 crew members set out across the frozen sea. A storm separated them, and Melville mustered a team of locals in the desolate Lena Delta to find his missing shipmates. He braved the wilderness as the days grew shorter, his legs so swollen and blistered from exposure that he vomited with the pain.
First he found the pole. It marked the spot where George De Long, the Jeannette's captain, had buried the valuables he had grown too weak to carry. They included Captain De Long's most prized possessions: the ship's four logbooks. These hefty, leather-bound volumes recorded, in intimate detail, the ill-fated Jeannette expedition and the discoveries it had made.
It took Melville four more months to find De Long's body. Nineteen other crew members also died, their heroic lives cut short by drowning, disease, exposure and starvation. But, thanks to Melville, the logbooks survived. Once, while battling through a snowstorm, he briefly considered reburying them to lighten his load, then changed his mind. ""Setting my teeth against the storm,"" he wrote, ""I would swear a new oath to carry them through, let come what might.""
Thousands of miles away, and 138 years later, the Jeannette's logbooks sit in a climate-controlled room in the U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. Every page has been digitized and uploaded to the web, then transcribed by an eccentric group of citizen-scientists called Old Weather.
For the past decade, its far-flung volunteers have shown that the Jeannette's logbooks, and others like them, are more than what Melville called ""the records … of our two years of toil and suffering."" They are rich repositories of data that can help us understand how profoundly the Earth's climate has changed and what might happen to it in the future.
Meteorologists have long recorded the weather at land-based stations. But nearly three-quarters of the planet is covered by water, and that's where most weather takes place. Thousands of ships have criss-crossed the oceans, noting the weather in handwritten logbooks that for decades sat forgotten in bookshelves and basements.
In a sometimes-obsessive quest, thousands of Old Weather volunteers have extracted millions of observations about barometric pressure, wind speed, air temperature and ice from the old logbooks. These are fed into a huge dataset at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, creating what NOAA calls ""a dauntingly complex, high-resolution, four-dimensional reconstruction of the global climate that estimates what the weather was for every day back to 1836.""
Or, as NOAA has nicknamed it, ""a weather time machine.""
Many of the ships, like the Jeannette, hail from the great era of Arctic exploration, when crews risked everything in a race for the North Pole. Ships plunged into the frozen unknown and vanished, inspiring other ships to launch daring but luckless missions to rescue them. In an age when Arctic ice is fast disappearing, many Old Weather volunteers also see their work as a rescue mission, but with much higher stakes, as the warming Earth makes its own leap into the unknown.
""A SATELLITE VIEW OF 19TH CENTURY WEATHER""
Three years ago, a private Russian expedition searched in vain for the wreck of the Jeannette. The ship spent three days stuck in ice while hungry polar bears prowled around it. It didn't, however, sink.
""That would have been quite ironic, don't you think?"" says Kevin Wood, who was on the ship.
Wood, a research scientist at both NOAA and the University of Washington in Seattle, is the lead investigator for Old Weather's Arctic project.
Wood got involved in Old Weather after meeting its founder, a British meteorologist called Philip Brohan, at a conference in Baltimore. Over a drink at a nearby pub, Brohan explained his problem: Old Weather volunteers were working so quickly, they'd soon run out of the Royal Navy logbooks he had set them to transcribing in 2010.
So, in 2011, Wood set up a team at the National Archives to start digitizing its 80,000 or so logbooks from U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships. Their weather observations, once extracted by volunteers, will help scientists build what Wood calls ""essentially a satellite view of 19th century weather.""
At the time, these observations helped captains navigate safely and swiftly across a trackless sea. The logbooks were returned to naval authorities or ship owners, who used them to build pilot charts and guide later navigators. ""Today, we can go back and reuse all that data, with a completely new purpose that they would never have imagined,"" Wood says. ""Every ship becomes part of our quest. Because the more data we have, the better the reanalysis will be.""
Wood handles the science for Old Weather, but as a sailor who spent more than 25 years roaming the world's oceans, he seems equally smitten with the romance of the seafaring life. He describes himself as a ""sporadically voracious reader"" who devoured all 20 volumes of Patrick O'Brian's high-seas adventure series, ""Master and Commander,"" in six weeks.
Although about 20,000 people have contributed to Old Weather over the years, Wood says a 50-strong community of stalwarts has done about half the work. One is Joan Arthur, who works as the office coordinator at an environmental institute at the University of Oxford. We meet on a chilly afternoon in late autumn, the city's ancient, cobblestone streets teeming with students and tourists.
""Would you like some Victoria sponge cake?"" she asks, leading me to a table in the institute's tiny kitchen. Other staff come in and out, and at one point she breaks off to chat with a colleague about an algorithm that counts penguins.
Arthur, 61, whose father had served on a Royal Navy ship, first heard of Old Weather five or six years ago, through an ad on the university's website.
She was soon captivated by the logbooks and the ""thundering age"" of exploration they recorded. ""The stories are just so astonishingly epic,"" she says. Her emails are punctuated with phrases such as ""How exciting!"" and ""Oh joy!"" One promises tales of ""a mutiny, a death, a tussle with ice, scrappy writing, a spelling nightmare.""
Arthur worked on the Jeannette's logbooks, whose weather and ice observations have allowed researchers to reconstruct the climate in an area of the Arctic that was then almost unknown. ""It was basically the moon,"" Kevin Wood says. ""We had no information about it.""
Old ships' logs can also offer new insights into extreme events such as storms or floods, which happen infrequently and therefore need a long history to properly understand. Data from the Jamestown, another U.S. Navy ship, and the Jeannette was reanalyzed by NOAA's ""weather time machine"" to reconstruct what had long been described as a hurricane that hit Sitka in Alaska in 1880. The reanalysis showed that it wasn't a hurricane, but part of a much larger storm system known as an extra-tropical cyclone. 
After working on the Jeannette for a while, Arthur switched to the Rodgers, a Navy ship that in 1881 was sent to find Captain De Long and his crew. She talks about the Rodgers as if it's still afloat – ""She's a bit of a tub to sail"" – but the Rodgers is long gone, its story almost as tragic as the ship it was meant to rescue.
A RESCUE GOES TERRIBLY WRONG
The Rodgers sailed from San Francisco on June 16, 1881, with 38 men on board. They had no way of knowing that, three days earlier, the Jeannette had already been crushed by the ice, and De Long and his shipmates had begun their desperate journey over a no-man's land toward Siberia.
At first, the Rodgers sailed west, crossing the North Pacific to resupply at a port on Russia's wild Kamchatka Peninsula. Then it headed north, passing through the Bering Strait, the sliver of ocean separating two continents, and into barely charted Arctic waters teeming with walruses, polar bears and whales. It was greeted by displays of the northern lights, which the ship's awestruck logkeeper describes in terms of what sailors know best: the sea.
26 September: Remarkably bright star light and intensely brilliant and active aurora … It would occasionally burst into still brighter luminosity and the thin arcs uniting would form one broad belt of light heaving and tossing like the sea in a gale.
Nearly all U.S. Navy vessels had a scientific component, and the Rodgers was no exception. The instruments on board – chronometer, thermometer, barometer, compass – were, at the time, state-of-the-art. Its logbook begins with directions for recording everything from accidents and desertions to ""the appearance of the Heavens.""
Every hour, the crew dutifully noted the ship's speed and course, as well as the temperature, weather, wind conditions and barometric pressure. By late August, as the Rodgers neared Wrangel Island, the log began making the observations about ice that future scientists would find so valuable. For the Rodgers, however, monitoring the shifting ice that could trap or even scupper it was a matter of life or death:
Midnight to 2.20am: Ship in pack ice partially. Hove to under spanker and jib. 2.20am: Started ahead slowly under steam to work ship out of ice. Ship struck several times against heavy cakes. . . Shifting course to avoid ice, making good North-East.
Twice the Rodgers changed course to investigate what looked like ""a black mass resembling a ship""; both times it proved to be a ship-sized chunk of dirty ice.
With pack ice closing in, the Rodgers headed south again. It had found no trace of the Jeannette's crew, who by this time had begun their arduous trek across the ice, hundreds of miles to the west. But the Rodgers was about to get a taste of what the missing sailors were suffering.
En route, the Rodgers sent ashore Charles Putnam, the ship's 29-year-old master, and seven other crew members. Equipped with 18 dogs, two sleds and a year's provisions, Putnam's team had orders to continue the search for the Jeannette along the Siberian coast.
The Rodgers sailed on to evade the ice – only to be destroyed by a fire that started in its hold just five months into its mission. Its crew and its logbooks were rescued, although there was one casualty. The ship's dog, a sorry-looking mutt called One-Eyed Riley, died in the fire.
When Charles Putnam heard that the Rodgers had been destroyed, he raced south to help his shipmates. On the way a storm blew up, and Putnam – separated from his guides, half-blinded by snow – drifted out to sea on a chunk of ice.
Later that day, he was spotted floating about seven miles offshore. ""A vigorous attempt was made to rescue him by four of the Rodgers's crew and two natives in a canoe,"" according to an official dispatch, ""but owing to the intervening ice they were unable to reach him and were obliged to put back after getting three miles from shore. This was the last ever seen of Putnam.""
MUTINIES AND AURORAS
""Poor Mr. Putnam,"" Joan Arthur sighs. ""I read that and it traumatized me for some time."" So did the death of One-Eyed Riley. ""Bless his cotton socks,"" she says. ""He probably would have ended up in the pot anyway."" (Case in point: Snoozer, the last surviving sled dog on the Jeannette. The famished crew made him into what their captain called a ""nauseating"" stew.)
Most of her co-workers have gone home, and a janitor pushes a vacuum cleaner around Arthur's feet. Oblivious, she taps at her laptop, explaining how the voyages of the Rodgers and the Jeannette provide scientific data not just about weather and ice.
In 2016, an academic paper on Arctic auroras was published in Astronomy and Geophysics, the journal of the Royal Astronomical Society in London. It was based on observations gleaned by Old Weather volunteers from the Jeannette's logs, written while the ship was held captive by ice. Old Weather volunteers have also collected log entries about wildlife, kelp, comets and volcanic activity. ""We've discovered volcanic eruptions that have not been recorded before,"" Arthur says.
As Navy ships, the Jeannette and the Rodgers were run with a discipline reflected in their logbooks, which were usually detailed and legible. Not like the logs of whaling ships that Old Weather began transcribing in 2015. Whaling logbooks often have poor handwriting, worse spelling and erratic punctuation, Arthur says. Sometimes, as with this breathless scribble about a mutiny on the Lucretia in 1883, it's all three:
At last the Capt told them the time was past for Agument and the first man … drew Pistol and said Shute you Son of a Bitch and did Shute at the Capt and jumped over from the Port Side of the Ship to the Starboard and was met by the Capt who Shot Him dead …
The whaling logbooks are challenging, but the extra effort is worth it, Kevin Wood says. Yes, the whalers make fewer daily observations than the Navy ships and generally lack instrumental weather data. ""However, there are many more whaling voyages, and especially in the early years there are many ships out on the ice-edge at the same time in a given year,"" he says. ""This will significantly augment the picture we have of the ice.""
THE NUN AND THE WHALING SHIP
Helen Julian is a nun who lives in Darlington, in northern England. Her first logbook for Old Weather belonged to a 980-ton British naval sloop that patrolled the African coastline during World War I. It had what she calls ""a very unexciting war,"" but she was soon absorbed by the rhythms and details of life at sea a century ago.
""You always have a very particular relationship with your first ship,"" she says. ""It's a bit like falling in love. You can't always say why.""
We sit in the living room of her modest home, the last of the day's sun slanting through its bay window. Helen Julian, who is 64, belongs to an Anglican religious order of sisters called the Community of St Francis. She wears a wooden, T-shaped crucifix, or St. Francis cross, over her blue tartan sweater. She describes herself as an introvert, but she's outgoing and eager to dispel myths about her religious calling.
""If you need a friendly nun, I'm here,"" she says. ""I'm all in favor of making ourselves known to people who actually want to take us seriously. It's not all 'The Sound of Music.'""
St. Francis is the patron saint of ecology, and Helen Julian says Old Weather feels ""like part of my discipleship."" She heard about the group by chance, on a radio program, and saw it as a way that someone with no scientific background could help climate science.
""It's a contribution to an important cause and to another form of community,"" she says, meaning the nerdy and unfashionably courteous Old Weather Forum, an online chat room that many volunteers speak of with affection. In one chat titled ""Signs of OW addiction,"" a volunteer said she continued to transcribe a logbook despite going into labor.
Helen Julian is currently working on the Fleetwing, a 19th century whaling ship whose logbook was kept by the captain's 15-year-old daughter, Adaline Heppingstone. Whaling captains often brought wives and children on voyages, she says, but it was rare to find a log written by a teenage girl.
At the time, American whaling ships were floating abattoirs, their decks slippery with blood and oil. Many logs detail the gruesome, round-the-clock task of processing the whale: slicing off the blubber, boiling it to extract the oil, harvesting the bone. Some logs record a kill with a whale-shaped stamp.
The interests of 19th century whaling captains and 21st century climatologists converge on a long-suffering species: the bowhead whale. Bowheads feed by filtering the ocean with long vertical plates in their mouths called baleen, a substance once highly prized for making everything from horse whips to corsets. Whaling ships hunted them by patrolling the ice-edge where the bowheads fed, which meant their logbooks were filled with observations about ice.
These observations were taken when the Arctic felt impossibly remote from everyday life. Today, says Wood, we know the Arctic plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate, and that changes there will affect us all. Melting ice exposes more ocean or land, which, because it is darker, absorbs more sunlight and causes more heating. Melting ice on land also causes sea-level rise.
In 1882, the Fleetwing was part of a U.S. fleet searching Arctic waters for bowheads. They have the longest life spans of any whale: 200 years or more. There might be bowheads alive today who remember the mass slaughter of their species – who might even have fled from the Fleetwing's approach.
DOMESTICITY AND GORE
In some of her entries in the Fleetwing's logbook, Adaline writes of everyday pastimes. She does embroidery with her mother and takes walks on the deck. She plays checkers with the captains of nearby whaling ships, and records a visit by some ""Esquimaux"" selling fox skins.
In others, domesticity comes with a dollop of gore. Over a few days in April, in precise cursive with little flourishes on the capital letters, Adaline describes the crew butchering whales and boiling the blubber into oil.
Saturday 22: Today we got our first bowhead this year. We had a fine breeze and struck at 3 o'clock P.M. and we are cutting him in now it is a large one … I have been working on my lovely little cushion today, and Mother has been sewing on a wrapper that she is making.
Sunday 23: … we had a hard time to cut our whale, as it was quite rugged, but we got it all safe.
Monday 24: It is snowing a little at times but not so hard that it keeps us from boiling. This afternoon Father and Mother covered the sofa to save it from getting any oil on it.
Three weeks passed, with Adaline recording a few sightings but no catches. Then, on the afternoon of May 17, the crew spotted a whale and her calf, ""and struck right away."" Writes Adaline: ""We got the calf too – it was very small. We took it in on deck. We are cutting.""
Apart from the logbook, Adaline left little trace in the world. Helen Julian, transcribing the log in her cosy living room in England, had assumed the captain's daughter had died very young. But then she was directed to a website that uses crowdsourcing to locate old graves. It noted that Adaline had died in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, in 1957.
Helen Julian was delighted; she and the whaler's daughter had drawn closer. ""She was still alive when I was born. We overlapped. Just.""
LETTERS FROM THE PAST
Helen Julian has never met Joan Arthur, and neither of them has met Michael Purves, another Old Weather stalwart, who lives in Victoria, British Columbia. They mainly communicate through the forum, and talk about one another fondly, like old friends. Purves laughs about them playing a Monopoly-like online game that Arthur created. Called Shipopoly, the dog-shaped playing piece is One-Eyed Riley.
Purves brings to Old Weather climate expertise and experience of northern latitudes. Now 72, he's a retired meteorologist who spent 22 years living and working in the Yukon in western Canada, a wild and sparsely populated territory famous for gold rushes and grizzlies.
Purves lives in a blue clapboard house filled with artwork from the Yukon. On its roof is a small weather station that produces reports for his neighbors. His first ship was the Grafton, a Royal Navy battle cruiser that served in World War I. Scruffy handwriting made the logbooks hard to read, but Purves was hooked.
""There is a deeper connection when reading something handwritten than when reading the same information in print,"" he says. ""Reading the various entries is almost like hearing individual voices."" Once, the Grafton rescued the survivors of a torpedoed hospital ship. Reading the logs, Purves thought: ""This is real. A real person saw this and wrote this.""
His work for Old Weather has driven home how quickly and profoundly the planet's climate is changing. He has helped refine the data in the logbooks – and therefore the climate models they inform – by plotting about 350,000 hourly locations for dozens of ships, including the Jeannette and the Rodgers.
He has spent more time on a ship called the Bear than any other. Built in Scotland in 1874, the Bear spent its most illustrious years in the Arctic in the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service, a forerunner of the Coast Guard. Its career spanned 89 years, two centuries, two world wars and both poles. It sank in 1963 while being towed to Philadelphia to become a floating restaurant.
""I've done 38 years of the Bear,"" Purves says, ""and we're still transcribing."" His home is a short drive from the coast; in its heyday, the Bear would have sailed past to take on coal at Ladysmith or anchor in Vancouver Harbour. ""I could even look it up and tell you which days …""
Earlier this year, he was reading the Bear's log from June 1918. It had set out to resupply the remote Alaskan outpost at Point Barrow, but heavy ice forced it to turn back. Purves looked at maps published by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a U.S. government agency based in Boulder, Colorado, to see where the ice was in June 2019. What he found was sobering.
""The ice in 2019 was more than 650 miles north of where it was on the same day in 1918,"" he says. ""You sit there and you think: Whoa.""
Purves feels most people have yet to grasp the gravity of climate change. ""I'm 72, and I'm thinking I'll still live to see a summer with no ice in the Arctic Ocean,"" he says. ""Will that be enough to wake people up? I really don't know.""
HELL ROARING MIKE
The Bear's best-known captain was an iron-fisted, hard-drinking sailor called Michael Healy – a.k.a. ""Hell Roaring Mike."" Healy was born in Georgia, the son of a plantation owner and a slave. But he looked white, and his racial background remained secret until 1971, decades after his death. Only then was Healy recognized by the U.S. Coast Guard as the first African American to command a federal ship.
In 1880, Healy was a lieutenant on another ship that searched in vain for the missing Jeannette. Three years later, at the Bear's helm, he ruled Alaska. He chased poachers and smugglers, rescued shipwrecked sailors, delivered mail and medicine, and transported missionaries, criminals, scientists and VIPs. Declared the New York Sun, ""If you should ask in the Arctic Sea, 'Who is the greatest man in America?' the instant answer would be, 'Why, Mike Healy.'"" The newspaper continued: ""He knows the Bering Sea, the Straits, and even the Arctic as no other man knows them.""
The Bear's logbooks are among the longest records of marine observation in the Arctic. Nearly unbroken, they run to tens of thousands of pages. While packed with weather observations, the logs are also terse and unrevealing, even during Healy's most dramatic moments, like when he rescued 160 people from five whaling ships wrecked by a storm:
5 August 1888: At 0640 got underway, 0755 came to anchor among the whaling fleet, Point Barrow… Received on board part of crews all wrecked and in destitute condition.
""When I am in charge of a vessel, I always command; nobody commands but me,"" Healy once declared. ""I do not steer by any man's compass but my own."" But his heroism sat uneasily with a reputation for abusing alcohol and his fellow sailors. Another terse logbook entry carries the seeds of his downfall:
8 July 1889: Captain Corrigan of whaling bark ""Wanderer"" came on board requesting assistance, his crew being in a state of mutiny … Sent an officer and boats.
Healy was later accused of ""tricing"" some of the mutineers – that is, tying their hands behind their backs, then hanging them so that their toes barely touched the deck. He also inflicted the same agonies on his own crew. In 1896, after a trial in San Francisco, he was stripped of the command of the Bear. He died eight years later.
In 2015, a Coast Guard icebreaker named after him, the Healy, became the first unaccompanied U.S. surface ship to reach the North Pole.
ENDURANCE AND HOPE
The pack ice that destroyed those old ships now retreats enough during the summer to allow luxury cruises through Arctic waters. A New Zealand company called Heritage Expeditions makes regular voyages to Wrangel Island, near where the Jeannette was first trapped, its desperate crew surviving by eating the polar bears and walruses that today's tourists come to see.
Those tourists are rarely disappointed. Polar bears gather on Wrangel Island in ever-increasing numbers, possibly driven ashore by the loss of sea ice, say researchers. The ""measureless frozen ocean"" that Captain De Long described is no more, and his era's obsession with conquering the North Pole has been replaced by the graver challenge that drives so many Old Weather volunteers: averting catastrophic climate change.
For those volunteers, the logbooks are a reminder not only of how much the world has changed, but also of the human capacity for ingenuity, endurance and hope. Even in the permanent gloom of an Arctic winter, with the ice grinding and screeching around his ship, De Long wrote:
If we are thrown out on the ice we must try to get to Siberia, if we can drag ourselves and food over the two hundred and forty miles intervening; sleds are handy, dogs ready, provisions on deck, knapsacks packed, arms at hand, records encased. What more can we do? When trouble comes we hope to be able to deal with it, and survive it!

Police visited offices of SIAS units Autostrada dei Fiori in Turin and Sina in Milan and the coastal town of Savona and took documents relating to the collapse of the bridge on the A6 highway near Savona on Nov. 24.
No casualties were reported. The fall of the bridge highlighted concerns about the safety of Italy's crumbling motorway infrastructure following the collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa last year that killed 43 people.
Police said in a statement that they seized documents about ""engineering, construction, regular inspections and maintenance"" of the bridge.
No comment was available from Autostrada dei Fiori, SIAS or from SIAS' parent company, Gavio.
Prosecutors in Savona have opened a criminal investigation following the Nov. 24 incident, without identifying any suspects.
On Tuesday, tax police searched offices of Atlantia's toll roads unit and said they were opening a new line of investigation into motorway safety barriers following the deadly collapse of the Morandi bridge."

MADRID (Reuters) - U.N. chief Antonio Guterres exhorted major world economies on Wednesday to signal more ambitious commitments to cut greenhouse emissions as climate talks in Madrid hit an intense phase.
""We need to have the big emitters understanding that their role is essential, because if the big emitters fail, everything will fail,"" Guterres told Reuters in an interview. 
""If we just go on as we are, we are doomed.""
He was speaking in a hangar-like conference center in Madrid where ministers from around the world are cloistered in the final days of two-week talks to shore up the 2015 Paris Agreement to avert catastrophic global warming.
Major polluting countries such as China, India and the United States - which is leaving the pact - are not expected to make big new announcements at the summit, where delegates are focused on technical negotiations over rules on carbon markets.
Nevertheless, Guterres hopes the talks will conclude on Friday with a strong signal that governments are ready to submit more ambitious climate plans in 2020, seen as a make-or-break year for the Paris process.
Under the deal, countries are supposed to submit more stringent targets to cut carbon emissions in the run-up to the next annual round of talks in Glasgow.
Scientists say that current pledges are nowhere near enough to stabilize the earth's climate in time to avert catastrophic sea-level rise, prevent severe damage to agriculture, and stop droughts and floods generating waves of forced mass migration.
Guterres urged major emitters to send a clear signal they are ready to increase their ambition next year and ""hopefully"" commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 - seen as vital to keeping global temperatures within manageable levels.
""History cannot accept that my generation will betray our children and grandchildren,"" said Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister, who has made climate a signature issue since taking over as U.N. secretary-general in early 2017.
Guterres welcomed moves by the European Union to adopt a new ""European Green Deal"" to transition to a low-carbon economy. Details of the policy were being unveiled in Brussels on Wednesday to coincide with the U.N. climate summit. 

""It is always essential that someone starts,"" Guterres said. ""If Europe will do so, that I think will be a very important contribution for others to consider the same kind of commitment. If no-one starts, then there is no chance.""

679,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 08:07AM ET</span>",Pakistan scholar's blasphemy trial enters final stages as U.S. raises alarm,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani court will hear final arguments on Thursday in the blasphemy trial of a liberal scholar and former university lecturer a week after a U.S. religious freedom commission placed his name on its list of global victims, his lawyer said.
Junaid Hafeez, who quit his studies at Pakistan's top medical college to pursue a passion for art and literature, secured a Fulbright scholarship and attended Jackson State University in 2009 where he majored in American literature, photography and theater with distinction.
He has been in solitary confinement in Pakistan for fear of being attacked by fellow inmates in jail since his arrest in 2013 on blasphemy charges linked to online posts.
Insulting Islam's Prophet Mohammad carries a mandatory death penalty in Pakistan, which is about 95 percent Muslim and has some of the harshest blasphemy laws in the world.
The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said Hafeez and his family had been facing murder threats.
In 2013, students at a university in central Pakistan where Hafeez taught English literature accused him of blasphemous Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts.
His lawyers say he was framed by students from an extremist Islamist party for his liberal and secular views.
""Hafeez has experienced extreme trauma to his mental and physical health,"" the commission wrote under his bio data on the global religious freedom list updated this week.
""It is a kind of a recognition that people are being persecuted in Pakistan for their belief and freedom of expression,"" his lawyer, Asad Jamal, told Reuters.
He said a judge would hear final arguments both from prosecution and defense on Thursday.
Since the trial began, several judges have backed out of hearing the case due to death threats.
""The lengthy trial is now on its eighth judge and the prosecution has repeatedly failed to produce evidence of the alleged blasphemy,"" the commission said, adding that one defense lawyer had been murdered.
No executions for blasphemy have been carried out in Pakistan but merely an allegation at times is enough for a mob to lynch someone accused of blasphemy.
The Center for Social Justice, a rights group, says at least 1,549 people have faced blasphemy charges since 1987 and 75 of them were murdered.
A Christian woman spent eight years on death row falsely charged with blasphemy before she was acquitted and left the country. A provincial governor and a minister were killed for taking up her case.
Asia Bibi's release in October last year sparked rioting by hardline Islamists, who rejected the Supreme Court's verdict and warned Prime Minister Imran Khan's government that she must not be allowed to leave the country."

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - More than 100 lawyers stormed and ransacked a hospital in Pakistan on Wednesday to avenge what they said was an assault by doctors there on a fellow advocate, and an elderly patient died during the disturbance, authorities said.
Zulfikar Hameed, the Lahore city police chief, said the mob smashed windowpanes, doors and equipment at the cardiology hospital and also set several vehicles on fire.
Some of the protesters fired gunshots and pelted arriving police with stones and bricks, according to a hospital doctor, Ashraf Nizami. Several lawyers were arrested, police said.
""It was catastrophic for hours,"" Nizami said, adding that a 70-year-old female patient had died, and several patients were left unattended for hours, during the violence.
Nizami said the attackers forced doctors and nurses to flee, leaving patients in emergency and intensive care unattended.
Police fired tear gas to quell the mob while terrified patients and hospital staff fled to safety, officials said.
Lahore government official Kamran Ali said the lawyers were enraged over what they said was the beating by doctors of a lawyer at the hospital over his refusal to get in a queue of patients.
He said the lawyers were particularly angry about the doctors disseminating a mobile phone video on social media showing the beating.
The mob also roughed up provincial information minister Fayaz-ul-Hasan Chauhan when he got to the scene and tried to negotiate with the lawyers.
Prime Minister Imran Khan's office launched an investigation into the incident. ""It is a shame that some people would go and attack a hospital,"" his spokesman Nadeem Afzal Chan said."

Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, 41, has emerged as the most outspoken opponent of the government headed by former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha after the party he helped found came a surprise third in an election in March and has since emerged as the most vocal challenge to the government.
""The loan to the Future Forward Party from Mr. Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit... violates article 72 of political party legislation,"" the Election Commission said in a statement.
It was referring to a clause that forbids acceptance of money, assets, or interests from questionable sources.
The party borrowed 191.2 million baht ($6.3 million) in two sums, one of 161.2 million baht ($5.3 million) in January, and a second of 30 million ($994,000) in April, Thanathorn said in an official declaration of assets to an anti-graft panel.
A dissolution of the party could also lead to a bar from politics for party officials, although the legislation sets no timeframe.
""Why is the money we got through loans from Thanathorn, the party leader, questionable? The Election Commission did not explain this,"" Future Forward Party Secretary-General Piyabutr Saengkanokkul said, accusing the election panel of not providing enough reasons for the case.
Thai political party law does not bar parties from taking loans. Future Forward Party has previously made its loans public and said that they will be paid back with interest.
""The decision by the election commission will not stop Future Forward's journey,"" Piyabutr said.
""Let it be known that the party created for the search of a new future for the country doesn't have a place to stand,"" he said.
Last week, Thanathorn accused the government of unfairly targeting him and the party with a string of legal tactics that undermined democracy in Thailand, which had been under military rule until the March election, following a 2014 coup.
Analyst warn that the move by the Election Commission to dissolve the Future Forward party could backfire on the government.
""This could escalate the popularity of the Future Forward Party and if it gets dissolved the party's popularity won't die but will become stronger,"" Titipol Phakdeewanich, dean of the faculty of political science at Ubon Ratchathani University told Reuters.
""But it is bad for democracy,"" he said. 
Since the election, Thanathorn was suspended from parliament and was found guilty last month of breaching election law by holding shares in a media company on the date his candidacy was registered for the election.
""They use the law to destroy political opposition, something that has been going on since the 2014 coup,"" Titipol said.

""This shows that the election didn't back democracy but it has empowered the military to do whatever they want,"" he said.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 07:01AM ET</span>",'She is speaking out to us': Māori leader says volcano eruption was a message,"By Charlotte Greenfield
WHAKATANE, New Zealand (Reuters) - Pouroto Ngaropo, standing on an ancient settlement site overlooking the island of Whakaari, recites his ancestry back thousands of years, back to the volcano which erupted there on Monday.
""Whakaari is my connection to the ocean, to the land, and to the environment around me ... we are one and she's our ancestor,” said the 51-year old Māori spiritual leader whose genealogy is depicted in the tattoo art known as a ‘tā moko’ adorning his face.
The volcano island off New Zealand's North Island holds deep spiritual significance for his iwi or tribe, Ngāti Awa, which also own the company that ran tours there before the eruption.
Two of their boats were out on Monday; one made it back with the help of rescuers but the other did not. Overall, eight people - both tourists and locals - are still missing, presumed dead with six more confirmed fatalities and more than 30 injured.
The morning after the eruption, Ngaropo went out with two others at 4 a.m. - the time when he says the connection with the spiritual world is strongest.
He uttered a special prayer that places a prohibition, known as a rāhui, barring anyone save rescuers from visiting the island or fishing near the shores of the bay.
“We can't because Whakaari is in a state of mourning, her descendants have passed on and they're lying dead, still there on the island. The rāhui protects all of those things, it protects their spiritual right to have a proper burial ceremony,” he said.
""THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE""
The spiritual and cultural restrictions will last until all remains had been returned to families, Ngaropo said. When that happens, he will go out again, early in the morning, to lift the prohibition.
Even after it ends, many questions lie ahead for Ngāti Awa and their community in Whakatane, a town on the mainland, looking out over the Bay of Plenty to Whakaari, also known as White Island. Some are questioning whether tours - the economic lifeblood of the small community - should ever restart.
Ngaropo hopes that the island will be returned to his iwi with input from tribal authorities in the area so they can collectively decide its future and foster their spiritual connection with the volcano.
A spokesman for the Buttle family, listed as the legal owners of the island, declined to comment.
A court first ruled the island was privately owned early in New Zealand's colonial history in 1867. But a report to a tribunal more recently said Ngāti Awa and other tribes had interests in the land and had probably not been able to express their concerns over its ownership to the court at the time.
For Ngaropo, Whakaari - which means to reveal or show - was giving the world a warning, passing on a message from the spiritual to the physical realm.
The eruption, he said, was a reminder of the power of nature and humans' connection with it.
""Things are going to change and the order of things are going to be restored in terms of the spiritual domain, the connection to the environment ... and our connection to each other so it’s a very important message ... Whakaari is speaking out to us."""

JUBA (Reuters) - The United States has imposed sanctions on five South Sudanese officials it says are responsible for the likely murders of two human rights activists in 2017, as Washington piles more pressure on the war-torn country's government.
The U.S. Treasury named Abud Stephen Thiongkol, Malual Dhal Muorwel, Michael Kuajien, John Top Lam and Angelo Kuot Garang as responsible for the disappearance and alleged killing of human rights lawyer Dong Samuel Luak and opposition politician Aggrey Idri in January 2017.
""Although the Government of South Sudan has denied knowledge of their whereabouts, multiple sources have stated that Dong and Aggrey were extraterritorially kidnapped in Kenya by members of the South Sudanese security services,"" the Treasury said in a statement late on Tuesday.
A United Nations panel of experts reported in April that multiple credible sources suggested Aggrey and Dong were likely killed by South Sudan's National Security Service.
The two government critics were in exile in Kenya but the U.N. panel alleged they were kidnapped by South Sudanese security service officers, flown back to Juba, and executed on a farm owned by President Salva Kiir. The government denied any involvement in their disappearance.
Deputy foreign affairs minister Deng Dau Deng told Reuters on Wednesday that the government would respond soon to the sanctions announcement.
The sanctions were just one step toward accountability for the deaths of Aggrey and Dong, the U.S. watchdog group The Sentry said on Tuesday. ""Real justice will require the perpetrators of these crimes to be tried in a court of law,"" it said.
President Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar signed a peace deal in September 2018 to form the unity government by Nov 12. But days before the deadline, the two leaders gave themselves an extension of 100 days to implement the agreement, a move criticized by Washington.
Later last month, the U.S. recalled its ambassador from South Sudan and said it was re-evaluating its relationship with the South Sudan government.
Civl war broke out in oil-producing South Sudan in 2013, less than two years after the country gained independence from Sudan following decades of war. The conflict that has killed an estimated 400,000 people and forced millions from their homes."
685,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 06:19AM ET</span>",Austria's provisional leader pushes for coalition deal by January,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The head of Austria's provisional government has raised pressure on ex-Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives and the Greens to strike a coalition deal by January or else her cabinet would start taking more far-reaching, political decisions.
Brigitte Bierlein, a career judge, heads a temporary government of civil servants that took office after the previous right-wing government collapsed in the wake of a video sting scandal that felled the far right's then-leader. Bierlein says her government's role is simply to administer the country.
Kurz's People's Party (OVP) clearly won the Sept. 29 parliamentary election with 37.5% of the vote but needs a coalition partner to command a majority in the lower house. It is in coalition talks with the Greens, and though few details have emerged, both sides say significant differences remain.
""We hope for a conclusion soon. Whether that is (by) Christmas or January is not so important,"" Bierlein said in an interview with newspaper Der Standard published on Wednesday. ""But if the process drags on longer, the public would cease to be as accepting of our understanding of our mandate.""
Polls suggest Bierlein's government is well-liked despite, or perhaps because of, its discretion and limited action.
""We have thus far not filled any senior positions - no ambassadors, no department heads, initiated no legislation, with few exceptions. If this takes longer, we as a government would therefore have to reflect on and change our understanding of our mandate, in consultation with the president,"" she added.
Her cabinet of career civil servants has depicted itself as technocratic but it was still the result of a compromise between the three main parties - the OVP, the Social Democrats and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) - and its ministers are seen as close to one or two of them.
Bierlein was appointed vice president and then president of the Constitutional Court under the same political constellation - coalitions between the OVP and FPO.
Asked if she had any inside information on how the talks are going, Bierlein said: ""No. I do not know more than you.""
Her comments could play into the hands of Kurz's conservatives, who are widely seen as preferring to reach a deal quickly. The Greens have said they are in no hurry.
""In the long run this cannot go on, because one cannot put off many decisions endlessly,"" Bierlein said."
686,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",UK PM Johnson's waning lead casts doubt on election victory chances,"By Andy Bruce and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - A major polling forecaster slashed its prediction for Boris Johnson's majority in Thursday's British general election, saying the race has tightened and the prime minister can no longer be sure of victory.
YouGov, which accurately predicted the outcome of the last election two years ago with an elaborate survey that estimates the outcome in individual constituencies, cut its forecast for Johnson's likely majority by more than half to 28 seats. Two weeks ago it had predicted a majority of 68.
Possible outcomes still range from a landslide victory for Johnson's Conservatives to a hung parliament with no party in control.
The Dec. 12 election has been described by all parties as Britain's most important in memory, with Johnson calling for a big majority so he can swiftly pull Britain out of the EU. The main opposition Labour Party promises a new referendum on Brexit and the renationalization of utilities and railroads in its most left wing platform for decades.
The YouGov model indicated Johnson's Conservatives were on course to win 339 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons with 43% of the vote, versus Labour's 231 seats with 34% of the vote.
While that would be the Conservatives' best performance in seat terms since Margaret Thatcher's 1987 win, YouGov said the Conservatives' tally could fall anywhere from 311 to 367.
""It could not be tighter,"" Johnson, the face of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum, said on Wednesday when asked about the opinion polls showing a tighter race. 
""I'm just saying to everybody the risk is very real that we could tomorrow be going into another hung parliament, that's more drift, more dither, more delay, more paralysis for this country,"" he said.
Sterling fell sharply immediately after the poll, hitting as low as $1.3107, a drop of more than half a cent in Asian trading. In London it was last at $1.3117, down 0.3% on the day. Half a dozen opinion polls are due on Wednesday.
Johnson called the snap election to break what he said was the paralysis of Britain's political system after more than three years of crisis over how, when or even if to leave the European Union.
He has promised to deliver Brexit by Jan 31 if he wins a majority. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will negotiate a new Brexit deal and then grant a new EU referendum. 
Polls open at 0700 GMT on Thursday and close at 2200 when an exit poll will give the first indication of who has won.
LANDSLIDE OR LOST?
While there have been countless polls in the run-up to the election, YouGov's ""Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification model"" is seen as the most meaningful, offering a prediction of seats, rather than just vote share.
It crunched data from more than 100,000 interviews over seven days, using demographics, the specific circumstances in individual constituencies and national statistics to come up with a projection.
""We absolutely cannot rule out the 2019 election producing a hung parliament - nor can we rule out a larger Conservative majority,"" said Anthony Wells, YouGov's director of political research.
The polling showed that Johnson's main strategy to breaking Labour's so called ""Red Wall"" of seats across the Brexit-supporting Midlands and northern England could hand him victory.
""Most of the Conservative gains are expected to be in the north, in urban West Midlands and former mining areas in the East Midlands and County Durham - concentrated in areas that voted to leave the EU,"" Wells said.
Labour are predicted to lose 31 seats, taking them to the worst performance since 1983 when Labour leader Michael Foot lost to Thatcher. 
The Scottish National Party are forecast to make gains, winning 41 seats. The anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats are forecast to win 15 seats and the Brexit Party none, YouGov said.
In late May 2017, just over a week before the June 8 election, YouGov's model correctly projected Johnson's predecessor Theresa May would lose the Conservative Party's majority, even though she had been ahead in most polls.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Wednesday rejected accusations of genocide committed against her country's Muslim Rohingya minority as ""incomplete and misleading"", and said the case should not be heard by the U.N.'s highest court.
The Nobel Peace laureate, speaking during three days of hearings at the International Court of Justice, challenged allegations in a lawsuit brought by Gambia last month accusing Myanmar of violating the 1948 Genocide Convention.
Suu Kyi, once feted in the West as a heroine of democracy, spoke for about 30 minutes at the courtroom in The Hague in defense of the actions of the Myanmar military that for years had kept her under house arrest.
She said a military-led ""clearance operation"" in western Rakhine State in August 2017 was a counterterrorism response to coordinated Rohingya militant attacks against dozens of police stations.
""Gambia has placed an incomplete and misleading picture of the factual situation in Rakhine state in Myanmar,"" she said as she opened Myanmar's defense.
While Suu Kyi conceded that disproportionate military force may have been used and civilians killed, she said the acts did not constitute genocide.
""Surely, under the circumstances, genocidal intent cannot be the only hypothesis,"" she told the panel of 17 judges. ""Can there be genocidal intent on the part of a state that actively investigates, prosecutes and punishes soldiers and officers that are accused of wrong doing?""
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar to Bangladesh after the military launched its crackdown.
Last year, Myanmar's military announced that seven soldiers involved in a massacre of 10 Rohingya men and boys in the village of Inn Din in September 2017 had been sentenced to ""10 years in prison with hard labor in a remote area"".
They were the only security personnel the military has said it has punished over the 2017 operation. They were granted early release after less than a year in the prison.
Late last month, the military said it had begun a court martial of an unspecified number of soldiers over events in another village, Gu Dar Pyin, the site of a second alleged massacre of 10 Rohingya.
HIGH LEGAL BAR
Suu Kyi had listened impassively on Tuesday as lawyers for Gambia detailed graphic testimony of suffering of Rohingya at the hands of the Myanmar security forces.
A photograph of Suu Kyi with three smiling generals who are also Myanmar government ministers - Lieutenant General Ye Aung, Lieutenant General Sein Win and Lieutenant General Kyaw Swe - was shown in the courtroom by Gambia's legal team as evidence of what they said were her close ties to the military.
It brought widespread reaction from her supporters who denounced it on social media as an attempt to mock her.
Suu Kyi came to power in 2016 following a landslide election win, but a military-drafted constitution means she must share power with the army that ruled the Southeast Asian nation for decades. 
In three days of hearings this week, judges are hearing the first phase of the case: Gambia's request for ""provisional measures"" - the equivalent of a restraining order against Myanmar to protect the Rohingya population until the case is heard in full.
Gambia has argued it is every country's duty under the convention to prevent a genocide from taking place. Gambia has political support from the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Canada and the Netherlands.
The case is being followed closely across Rakhine state's border in Bangladesh, where more than 1 million Rohingya are now crowded into the world's biggest refugee camp.
On Wednesday, some refugees shouted ""liar, liar, shame!"", as they watched Suu Kyi defend Myanmar's case on television.
""She is a liar. A great liar, shame on her,"" said Abdur Rahim, 52, while watching a live telecast of her testimony on a local news channel at a community center in the Kutupalong camp.
The legal threshold for a finding of genocide is high. Just three cases have been recognized under international law since World War Two: In Cambodia in the late 1970s; In Rwanda in 1994; and at Srebrenica, Bosnia, in 1995.

Although a United Nations fact-finding mission found that ""the gravest crimes under international law"" had been committed in Myanmar and called for genocide trials, no court has weighed evidence and established a genocide in Myanmar.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 05:39AM ET</span>","With Netanyahu's fate in question, Israel poised for new election","By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel headed on Wednesday toward a third national election in less than a year with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing the fight of his life for political survival after a criminal indictment.
After giving its preliminary approval, and barring last-minute progress in deadlocked efforts to form a new government, parliament was set to vote for its dissolution later in the day and approve a March 2 election date already agreed by the two major parties.
What had once seemed nearly impossible to many Israelis - a third visit to polling stations after inconclusive elections in April and September - carries a heavy economic price: it will be well into 2020 before a new budget is passed, which will mean months of cutbacks that will weigh on growth.
Neither Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party nor the centrist Blue and White party led by his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, won enough seats in the Knesset (parliament) for a governing majority in the previous two contests.
Both men were delegated the task of forming a coalition, but failed. Each has blamed the other for the impasse, in which neither could agree on the terms for a ""rotating"" premiership.
In the two previous national ballots, Netanyahu's opponents focused on the three corruption investigations against him that included allegations he dispensed favors to media barons in a push for more favorable media coverage.
But this time, Israel's longest-serving leader is running under the cloud of criminal indictment after charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud against him were announced last month.
Denying any wrongdoing, Netanyahu, 70, has accused legal authorities of attempting a ""coup"" aimed at ousting a popular right-wing leader. Critics alleged that Netanyahu was trying to undermine the rule of law and set an election campaign theme portraying himself as the victim of “deep state” conspiracy.
As prime minister, Netanyahu is under no legal obligation to resign as a result of the indictment, and while in office he can ask the legislature to grant him immunity from prosecution.
As caretaker premier, Netanyahu would remain in the post until a new government is formed - a process that could stretch months past a March ballot if what is likely to be tortuous coalition-building is taken into account.
""The entire country is held hostage by the prime minister's legal battles,"" the left-wing Haaretz newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday.
Netanyahu, vowing to ""win big"" at the polls, has described himself as best-placed to deal with Israel's many security threats. He has citing challenges posed by arch-enemy Iran as a main reason why Gantz should rally to his call for a unity government.
An opinion poll on Israel's Channel 13 news on Tuesday forecast Blue and White would win 37 seats to Likud's 33 in the 120-member parliament, increasing the one-seat advantage it gained in the election in April. 

But it also indicated that both parties could still struggle to secure enough allies for a majority coalition.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court ruled on Wednesday to keep a U.S. consulate employee in jail as his trial on espionage charges continues, a lawyer said, meaning he will remain in detention until the next hearing in March.
The trial of Metin Topuz has been one many sources of strain between NATO allies Turkey and the United States, who have also been at odds over developments in Syria and Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defense systems.
Topuz, a Turkish translator and fixer for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul, has been in custody for more than two years. The next hearing was set for March 10, said his lawyer, Halit Akalp.
Topuz is charged with espionage and links to the network of cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is based in the United States and blamed by Turkey for plotting a failed 2016 coup. Topuz denies the charges.
""The accusations made against me are just claims... There is no evidence that could even justify suspicion that I committed these crimes,"" Topuz said during the hearing.
The court has repeatedly said it wants to hear one remaining witness in the case."

Tensions have soared between Tehran and Washington since last year, when President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions on Tehran that have crippled its oil-based economy.
The Islamic Republic has rejected negotiating a new deal with the Trump administration, saying talks are only possible if Washington returns to the nuclear pact and lifts sanctions. 
""The government is determined to defeat (the enemy) by bypassing America's sanctions...or through various means including talks, but we will not cross our red lines,"" the semi-official Iranian news agency ISNA quoted Rouhani as saying.
In a rare act of cooperation between Tehran and Washington, the United States and Iran each freed a prisoner on Saturday.
Washington said it was hopeful that the prisoner swap would lead to the release of other Americans held in Iran and that it was a sign Tehran was willing to discuss other issues.
Iran released Xiyue Wang, a U.S. citizen who had been held for three years on spying charges, while the United States freed Iranian Massoud Soleimani, who had faced charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Tehran.

Iran said on Monday there were about 20 Iranians jailed in the United States in cases linked to sanctions violations.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Foreign experts said they had quit advising a Hong Kong police watchdog on Wednesday due to doubts over its independence and ability to conduct an investigation into police conduct during months of anti-government protests.
The panel of five experts from Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand was recruited in September by the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) to help ensure its probe into allegations of police brutality was credible and free of bias.
""We ultimately concluded that a crucial shortfall was evident in the powers, capacity and independent investigative capability of IPCC,"" the foreign experts panel said in a statement.
""We remain committed to supporting and engaging with the IPCC, if and when it develops the necessary capabilities and provides its draft interim report on the protests, confrontations and policing of events between June and September 2019.""
Sparked by a controversial and now-withdrawn extradition bill, the often violent protests have morphed into calls for greater democratic freedoms and an end to alleged mainland Chinese meddling in the semi-autonomous former British colony. 
The panel had included Denis O'Connor, a former British chief inspector of constabulary, and Justice Colin Doherty, the head of New Zealand's police watchdog, along with other current and former police officials.
Their resignation deals a further blow to the credibility of a police force that has seen its standing with the public fall sharply in the past year.
The panel had been advising on a report due in January on the allegations of police misconduct, but raised its concerns last month.
""This is like a vote of no confidence,"" Tanya Chan, a pro-democracy lawmaker said. ""It will definitely affect the standard of the report.""
China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying defended the actions of the Hong Kong police, saying accusations that they had used excessive force were an enormous lie.
""In the U.S., in France, are there any police that are as highly restrained as the Hong Kong police?"" she told a daily briefing in Beijing.
Public satisfaction with the police force has fallen to the lowest on record, according to a poll released last month by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute.
The IPCC issued a statement thanking the panel for its work so far. It also acknowledged that it lacked investigative powers under its current legal framework and said it required the ongoing support of the city's political leaders and police chief.

""We hope to maintain close contact. The first stage of their work is basically over. The opinions they submitted will be reflected in the interim report,"" IPCC Vice-Chairman Tony Tse said.

U.S. lawmakers will vote - and likely pass - a defense bill later on Wednesday that calls for sanctions against Turkey over Ankara's decision to procure the S-400 defenses.
Turkey and the United States, NATO allies, have been at odds over the purchase. 
Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and cannot be integrated into NATO defenses. In response, it has suspended Turkey from the F-35 jet program, where it was a manufacturer and buyer, and threatened sanctions. 
In an interview with Turkish broadcaster A Haber, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said any U.S. sanctions would harm U.S.-Turkish ties and repeated a threat of retaliation. 
""U.S. lawmakers must understand they will get nowhere with impositions. If the United States approaches us positively, we will also react positively. But, if they take negative towards us, then we will retaliate these,"" Cavusoglu said.
Ties between Ankara and Washington have been strained over a host of issues in recent years. Turkey has been enraged with the U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Cavusoglu called the ""financing of terrorism"" on Wednesday.
He added that Turkey was open to alternatives to buying the F-35 jets, including from Russia. He said President Tayyip Erdogan and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had discussed speeding up work on the TF-X joint fighter jet project to meet Turkey's defense needs.
""We bought the S-400s because the most suitable offer on air defense systems came from Russia. Until we produce it ourselves, the alternative to the F-35 could be the Russian market, but we are open to other alternatives too,"" Cavusoglu said.
Turkey and Britain agreed a 100 million pound ($133 million) deal in 2017 to develop Turkish fighter jets, and Turkey's Kale Group said it was setting up a joint venture with Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) to work on the project. In March Rolls-Royce said it had scaled back efforts to join the program. 

A Turkish source said the disagreement with Rolls-Royce stemmed from licensing issues, which are ""critical and indispensible"" for Turkey. But the source said talks had been revived and added Turkey expected the project to advance after a solution was reached.

695,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 03:19AM ET</span>",India's parliament set to vote on contentious citizenship bill,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's ruling Hindu nationalists pushed for final parliamentary approval on Wednesday for a law that critics say undermines the country's secular constitution by granting citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from three neighboring countries.
Home Minister Amit Shah tabled the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the upper house of India's parliament, a day after the lower house gave its approval.
Opposition parties, minority groups, academics and a U.S. federal panel have contested the bill, which for the first time provides a legal route to Indian citizenship based on religion, calling it discriminatory against Muslims.
The proposed law seeks to give citizenship to Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs, who fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan before 2015.
The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said on Monday that Washington should consider sanctions against Shah, a close associate of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if India adopts the legislation.
Introducing the bill in the upper house, Shah defended his government's move, saying the new law only sought to help minorities persecuted in Muslim-majority countries contiguous with India.
""For India's Muslims, there is nothing to worry about, nothing to debate. They are citizens, and will remain citizens,""
Shah said.
Unlike the lower house, where Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has a clear majority, the ruling party will likely find it more challenging to push the bill through the upper house, as it is unclear whether it can garner enough support from regional parties.
A vote is expected late on Wednesday.
Protests against the measure have flared in various parts of India, including the ethnically diverse northeastern states, where people fear that settlers from neighboring Bangladesh could be granted citizenship.
In Assam state, thousands of people protested overnight across several towns and cities, some joining processions carrying flaming torches. Police said they used teargas to beat back protesters in at least two cities.
In northern India, thousands of students at Aligarh Muslim University began a hunger strike in protest.
Some opposition Muslim politicians have argued that the bill is targeted against the community, criticizing the Modi government for trying to render them ""stateless."""

At least 250 journalists were imprisoned worldwide this year, according to the report, which the committee compiles annually. The total last year was 255, said the report by the New York-based CPJ.
China's total rose by one since last year. The report noted that ""the number has steadily increased since President Xi Jinping consolidated political control of the country.""
""A crackdown in Xinjiang province - where a million members of Muslim ethnic groups have been sent to internment camps - has led to the arrests of dozens of journalists, including some apparently jailed for journalistic activity years earlier,"" the report said.
Asked about the report by at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said U.S.-based institutions had no credibility.
When asked about the number of journalists jailed in China, Hua said she could not confirm the figure, adding that China was a country where the rule of law prevailed and no one was above the law. 
""You should feel lucky that you work in Beijing and not in Washington,"" she told reporters. 
Turkey imprisoned 47 journalists in 2019, down from 68 last year. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, both with 26; Eritrea with 16; Vietnam, with 12; and Iran with 11 were the next-most oppressive countries for journalists, the report said.
It noted that ""authoritarianism, instability, and protests"" this year had led to an increase in the number of journalists imprisoned in the Middle East.
About 8% of those imprisoned globally are women, down from 13% last year, the report said. Politics, human rights and corruption were the subjects most likely to land journalists in jail, it said.
The report is a snapshot of the journalists imprisoned on Dec. 1 each year, the committee said. It does not include those who have been released earlier or journalists taken by non-state entities such as militant groups.

Marin, 34, took over Ardern's mantle as the world's youngest female leader on Tuesday.
""Oh, look, she needs no advice. This is ultimately one of those issues when people assume of course because you are young that you are not bringing experience and expertise to the table necessarily,"" Ardern told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday when asked if she has any advice for Marin.
""I see she's already a minister, she's already a member of the government. All I would say is: go well.""
Ardern, 39, burst into prominence during New Zealand's 2017 election and became the world's youngest prime minister at the time. She is feted globally as part of a new wave of progressive and young leaders that has included France's Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Justin Trudeau.
Ardern's message, however, was in contrast to some worldly wisdom offered by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who at 94 is the oldest leader of a country.
Mahathir said on Tuesday that it would be a good idea for Marin to ask ""old people"" for their advice.

""While we believe in the idealism of young people, it is important also for them to consider the experience of the old people,"" Mahathir said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The South Pacific islands of Bougainville have overwhelmingly voted to be independent from Papua New Guinea, the referendum commission said on Wednesday, in a historic poll that will embolden separatists as they start negotiating the terms of their sovereignty.
Almost 98% of the 181,067 votes cast backed independence in the non-binding poll that is part of a peace pact struck in the aftermath of a decade-long war between Bougainville's rebel fighters and PNG forces, which ended in 1998.
The referendum gave voters in the island cluster a choice between independence and greater autonomy.
""There's tears, tears of joy, raw emotion - people have waited a long time,"" referendum Chairman Bertie Ahern said in the town of Buka. ""The pen is always mightier than the sword.""
Bougainville's quest for independence is one of dozens of separatist movements in play around the world. There is a strong movement in Scotland seeking independence from the United Kingdom, while Catalan separatists in Spain remain active.
Thousands of protesting Papuans also recently called for an independence vote, seeking to separate from Indonesia. 
The comprehensive vote in Bougainville will be used to strengthen the hand of negotiators as they start discussions on the terms of independence with the PNG government.
Any agreement struck in the negotiations would still need to pass through PNG's parliament.
Just 3,043 voters backed the other option on the ballot - greater autonomy - while a small number of informal votes were recorded.
Pajomile Minaka, from Bougainville's southern region, told Reuters he was taking a law course to equip himself to help rebuild his homeland.
""That's my dream, to go and rebuild,"" said the 36-year old, who was a child during the conflict. ""We need the best policies, the best laws, to be the best country. We are reborn.""
Map locating Bougainville archipelago in the South Pacific: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9796/9708/Bougainville%20map.jpg 
The islands are still recovering from the conflict, which killed 20,000 people in a fight over land royalties and pollution in rivers near the now-shuttered Panguna gold and copper project.
It was the deadliest conflict in the area since the Second World War.
There was a mood of celebration throughout the two-week referendum, which ended on Dec. 7, with many voters carrying Bougainville's predominantly blue flag to polling stations.
The crowd that assembled at a vote count center in Buka on Wednesday to hear the results broke out into cheers and applause after the numbers were released.
The referendum commission said in a statement that the vote was orderly and peaceful. 
""We witnessed voting that was informed, free of fear and accessible,"" it said.
Ballots from different areas were mixed before officials tallied the results to eliminate the risk of reprisals.
Once the economic engine of PNG, Bougainville has fallen to the bottom of almost every financial indicator, despite boasting mineral riches, fertile volcanic soil and stunning geography. 
Bougainville Vice President Raymond Masono has told Reuters a transition could take 10 years, as the region would need to rebuild its institutions.

Discussion over how Bougainville would sustain its independence is likely to dominate negotiations after the referendum, two PNG ministers told Reuters earlier.

Anwar has denied the accusation by the aide, Muhammed Yusoff Rawther, describing it as ""politics at its worst"".
Muhammed Yusoff is being represented by a lawyer who counts Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad among his clients. On Tuesday, Mahathir promised to hand over power to rival-turned-ally Anwar in spite of the latest allegations against him.
Muhammed Yusoff said last week that Anwar had attempted to force him to have sex in September 2018.
Police recorded Muhammed Yusoff's statement on Monday, criminal investigations department director Huzir Mohamed said in a statement. 
""Statements from Anwar Ibrahim and several related witnesses will be taken as soon as appropriate appointment times are set,"" Huzir said.
In a statement to media, Anwar said he was grateful to police for speeding up investigations into the ""latest defamatory allegations"" against him. 
""I would like to stress that I am ready to give my statement to the police immediately to assist in the investigation."" 
Anwar has spent nearly a decade in jail on two separate counts of sodomy and for corruption, charges that he and his supporters maintain were aimed at ending his political career.
Muhammed Yusoff's lawyer, Mohamed Haniff Khatri Abdulla, denied a conflict of interest in taking on a case against the prime minister's planned successor.
""The prime minister is still my client but that does not mean I should not take on cases just because they involve his ministers or people in his administration,"" Mohamed Haniff told Reuters. 
""I did not speak to (Mahathir) before taking on this case, but we did talk about it afterwards. He was surprised but he understood.""
Mahathir's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mohamed Haniff denied charges of a political conspiracy in the allegations against Anwar, saying Muhammed Yusoff stood by his statement.
""It's time to let the police investigate,"" he said.
Same-sex acts are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia, and carry penalties of up to 20 years in jail if convicted. 
A former deputy premier, Anwar was first sacked and then jailed in 1999 during Mahathir's first 1981-2003 tenure as prime minister. 

Mahathir and Anwar mended fences in 2016, joining forces to lead the opposition to an unexpected election victory last year.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somali security forces shot dead five Al Shabaab gunmen, who had killed three civilians and two soldiers during an attack on a hotel near the presidential residence in Mogadishu on Tuesday night, police said early on Wednesday.
Al Shabaab, an al Qaeda linked Islamist militant group, frequently launches bombing and gun raids in Mogadishu in a bid to topple Somalia's U.N.-backed government. The group confirmed last night it had attacked the Syl hotel, a popular gathering place for officials and lawmakers.
The latest attack started at around 7 p.m. on Tuesday and ended at about 1 a.m. on Wednesday, when all five attackers had been killed, deputy police commissioner General Zakia Hussen said in a statement on Twitter.
""The security forces ended the operation. Five people including three civilians and two soldiers died in the attack,"" Hussen said.
""Eleven others were slightly injured, including nine civilians and two soldiers,"" she added.
Hussen had said on Tuesday night that 82 people, including several officials, had been rescued from the Syl hotel.
Security officers had initially mistook the gunmen for the police, until they began shooting and throwing grenades, another police officer said on Tuesday.
Al Shabaab's military spokesman Abdiaziz Abu Musab said on Tuesday that the group's fighters were behind the attack at the hotel compound near the presidential palace.
Somalia, in the Horn of Africa, has been embroiled in conflict and chaos since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew a dictator then turned on each other.
Al Shabaab, which once controlled much of the country, was forced out of Mogadishu in 2011 and has since lost most of its other strongholds. But its fighters regularly attack sites in Somalia and neighboring Kenya, which has troops in Somalia.

WHAKATANE, New Zealand (Reuters) - Increasing tremors on a volcanic island in New Zealand on Wednesday prevented the recovery of the bodies of eight people thought to be left on the island, two days after an eruption engulfed dozens of tourists in steam and hot ash.
Six people were killed in Monday's explosion at White Island, which lies some 50 km (30 miles) off the mainland, with another eight missing and presumed dead and 30 injured.
Authorities monitoring the uninhabited island said conditions were worsening and there was now a 40-60% chance of a massive eruption similar to Monday in the next 24 hours.
""In summary, yesterday there was a high risk of an eruption. Today there is an even higher risk of an eruption. And the parameters are worsening at the moment,"" Graham Leonard, a senior volcanologist at GNS Science, told a news conference in Wellington.
A plume of smoke could still be seen coming from the island.
""I've spoken to many of those involved in the operation and they are very, very eager to get back there, they want to bring people's loved ones home,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told Reuters.
GRAPHIC: Volcanic Eruption in New Zealand - https://graphics.reuters.com/NEW%20ZEALAND-VOLCANO/0100B4PR2DX/nzl-volcano.jpg
RISKS TO BE CONSIDERED
Police said the safety of recovery teams was the priority and are awaiting advice from experts on when they could access the island. That has prompted some criticism authorities are being too cautious.
""We cannot put other people in jeopardy to go out there until we're absolutely certain that the island is actually safe,"" Acting Assistant Commissioner Bruce Bird told a media conference in Whakatane, the town that is an access point for tourist trips to the island.
There were 47 people on White Island at the time of the eruption. Twenty-four of those were from Australia, nine from the United States, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two each from China and Britain and one from Malaysia.
A mother and daughter have become the first Australians to be named as victims, media said on Wednesday. Brisbane woman Julie Richards, 47, and her daughter Jessica, 20, had been confirmed dead, family friend John Mickel told Sky News.
GRAPHIC: Volcano map of New Zealand - https://graphics.reuters.com/NEW%20ZEALAND-VOLCANO/0100B4PY2EJ/New-Zealand-Volcano-Map.jpg
Aerial surveillance has detected no signs of life on the island, where at least one tour group was captured on automated webcams in the crater just a minute before the eruption.
Ardern said the primary focus was on caring for some 30 people who were injured and were being treated for burns at several hospitals around the country. 
Of the 30 injured, police said 25 are in a critical condition, and the other five were classed as stable but serious.
""Our absolute focus at the moment is ensuring we have the very best care for those who are injured,"" Ardern said in an interview at her office in Wellington's parliament, where the country's flag was flying at half-mast to respect victims of the tragedy. 
""I do understand that many have very critical injuries.""
The death toll from Monday's eruption rose to six after one victim died in hospital on Tuesday.
One of the private helicopter operators who landed on the island after the eruption and carried survivors back to the mainland said he thought conditions had been favorable and a recovery operation could be completed in about 90 minutes.

""For us, it's 20 minutes to get out there. We could load those folks on and be back here in an hour and a half,"" pilot Mark Law told the AM show on Three television.
""I know where they all are, and the conditions are perfect for recovery in my mind.""
Daily tours bring more than 10,000 visitors to the privately owned island every year, marketed as ""the world's most accessible active marine volcano"".

GeoNet raised the alert level for the volcano in November because of an increase in volcanic activity. The alert level was increased further after the eruption, and remains elevated.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 12:36AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Disasters, downturn challenge New Zealand's Ardern going into election year","By Praveen Menon and Jane Wardell
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern faces tough challenges as she heads into a general election campaign next year, with economic growth slowing, divisive referendums looming and a country reeling from disasters both natural and man-made.
Two years since she became the world's youngest female leader, Ardern remains hugely popular overseas thanks to her compassionate but decisive response to a mass shooting, her appearances on high-profile U.S. chat shows, and her ability to combine motherhood and leadership.
But the reality back home is a little different, with Ardern and her Labour Party's popularity slipping in opinion polls as voters worry her government has not yet made good on promises including tackling rising levels of homelessness and urban poverty.
Economic growth has slowed as a failed government housing project, new restrictions on oil exploration and foreign investment in real estate, plus tighter immigration rules have dented business confidence.
""There's only work to be done,"" Ardern, 39, told Reuters in an interview at her parliamentary office in Wellington. ""We have never claimed to be perfect. We have never claimed to have completed the job. There is more work to be done.""
Political pundits are predicting a close contest in the election, which needs to be held by next November, with scheduled referendums on legalizing cannabis and euthanasia expected to be divisive.
Treasury on Wednesday trimmed its 2020 economic growth forecast and flagged a budget deficit as international headwinds including Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war bite. The government announced a NZ$12 billion ($7.7 billion) infrastructure spend to try counter those factors.
Ardern said New Zealand was still ""holding up well"" relative to its peers, with unemployment the lowest in a decade and wages growth solid.
""The foundations of our economy are strong so my message to international investors is we're a good place to invest and my message to our domestic audience business is actually we're in a good position, now is a good time for them to grow, employ,"" she said shortly before the budget update.
Ardern noted the Labour Party is polling higher than it was before the 2017 election. However, Labour was reliant at that election on two minority parties to form government, a common quirk of the country's political system.
Two closely watched opinion polls released in October showed support for her ruling coalition at its lowest since 2017. Her own popularity also waned, but she remains far ahead of her rivals.
CHRISTCHURCH AND WHITE ISLAND
Nine months on from the Christchurch massacre, in which 51 Muslim worshippers who were killed at two mosques in the southern city, Ardern said she still felt a sense of responsibility. The world had more work to do on curtailing online platforms that allow the promotion of hateful ideology, she said.
""We see an ongoing role for us to play to try our very, very best to curb the ability for that tool to be used by anybody else,"" Ardern said, noting that response protocols developed in the aftermath of Christchurch had already been used in Europe.
Ardern's response to the massacre, when she wore a headscarf to meet with the families of the victims and then rapidly pushed a ban on semi-automatic weapons through parliament, was widely praised. There has since been some criticism on the inquiry process as well as the slow progress made on a review of hate speech laws.
This week's eruption of the White Island volcano, which killed at least six people, presents a further challenge.
Questions are already being asked about why tourists were allowed to visit an active volcanic island in the first place.
Ardern has pledged to hold an investigation, saying important questions demanded to be answered, but declined to comment on the potential longer-term impacts on New Zealand's thrill-seeker tourism economy.
""Ultimately, our focus at the moment is on the victims and families,"" she told Reuters just two days after the tragedy, as the New Zealand flag over parliament flew at half-mast.
""We're still caring for those who have been injured, still seeking to bring home those who have lost their lives.""
""FEMINIST KILLJOY""
Ardern's office in Wellington's distinctive ""Beehive"" parliament building overlooking the harbor is a testament to both her feminist credentials and her 18-month-old daughter, Neve Te Aroha.
A mug on her desk proclaims ""feminist killjoy"", while a replica of a World War Two era U.S. naval recruitment poster declares: ""Gee!! I wish I were a man. I'd join the navy.""
Ardern's pregnancy, maternity leave and the birth of her daughter while in office were viewed by many as symbolizing progress for women in leadership roles.
She became only the second elected leader to give birth while in office, after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto, and made headlines when she took baby Neve to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Soft toys and books for her daughter are scattered around sofas in her office. The children's book titles include ""She Persisted"" by former U.S. first daughter Chelsea Clinton and ""Dear Donald Trump"", a story about a young boy seeking advice on building a wall in his bedroom.
Ardern's international profile has been boosted by her recent appearance on Stephen Colbert's The Late Show, in which she personally picked up the U.S. comedian at the airport and hosted a backyard barbecue for him and popular New Zealand musician Lorde.
""I take that with a grain of salt,"" she said, when asked about her popularity overseas. ""I accept that part of my role is to represent New Zealand in international forums, to promote New Zealand's trade interests, to promote our values offshore. But my focus is here, always has been."""

The legislation is part of a years-long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process on the island. China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) has begun a renewed push for the legislation, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 11, and it could be passed before the end of the year.
The draft bill prohibits anyone donating to a political party, influencing elections or otherwise seeking to sway in Taiwan politics on the instructions of or with the financial support of ""infiltration sources"" - generally taken to mean China.
Speaking at a regular news briefing in Beijing, Zhu Fenglian, spokeswoman for China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office said the DPP had been using such ""law revisions"" to incite hostility and restrict normal exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
""In fact for Taiwan's people, especially Taiwanese businessmen and students, it has already caused alarm and panic that everyone is treated as an enemy,"" she added, referring to Taiwanese in China.
No matter how their tactics change, the DPP's aim is to intimidate and punish Taiwanese people who participate in exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Zhu said.
""They are trying to use this for political gain, but they will neither succeed nor enjoy popular support.""
China, with its 1.3 billion people, is Taiwan's favorite investment destination with Taiwan companies investing over $100 billion there in total, private estimates show.
Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China, has also condemned the proposed legislation, saying it is a ""political tool"" of President Tsai Ing-wen and her DPP to gain votes while trying to paint them as Chinese Communist Party agents.
Tsai and the DPP have repeatedly said the threat they face from China's disinformation and meddling is real.
China's Zhu reiterated that they had never gotten involved in what she termed ""elections in the Taiwan region""."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Devastating bushfires that blanketed Australia's largest city with hazardous smoke this week have heightened public anger and raised political pressure on the government to do more to tackle climate change.
While cooler weather eased fires and haze around Sydney on Wednesday, the thick smoke that covered the city on Tuesday has triggered protests and prompted one conservative lawmaker to break with his party by directly linking recent weather to carbon emissions.
""We are in the middle of the worst drought in living memory, this is the second hottest year on record,"" New South Wales Environment Minister Matt Kean, from the center-right Liberal-National coalition, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp Radio. ""Yesterday smoke was causing some of the worst air pollution in Sydney that we've ever seen - this is climate change.""
Sydney choked in some of the worst pollution seen in the city on Tuesday as more than 100 fires raged across the east coast, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and disrupting public transport services as air quality plunged.
Graphic: Mega fire surrounding Sydney spurred by winds (https://graphics.reuters.com/AUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES/0100B4Q42EX/sydney-fires.jpg)
On Wednesday, temperatures dropped by more than 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit), and winds eased, improving Sydney's air quality although it was still at levels considered hazardous.
Amid mounting public anger, Australia's Liberal-National government defended its policies in addressing climate change and downplayed links between climate change and the unprecedented early arrival and severity of the fires.
""Certainly, climate change is a factor, there is no question, but also it is important to note that most of these fires have been caused by 'Little Lucifers',"" Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack told ABC, referring to arsonists.
Australia's fires have killed at least four people since November, burnt about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroyed more than 400 homes.
While Australian police are investigating the triggers of some fires, firefighters and scientists have said the bulk of the blazes have been caused by soaring temperatures and three years of drought that has left bushland tinder-box dry.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said his government is committed to tacking climate change, insisting the country will meet its pledge to cut emissions from 26% to 28% by 2030, versus 2005 levels.
But critics accuse the government of merely playing lip service to climate concerns.
Protesters are scheduled to march through central Sydney during afternoon peak-hour on Wednesday.
""They (the government) are to blame for our largest city being poisoned and rather than taking meaningful action, they are fast tracking new coal mines,"" said Chloe Rafferty, an organizer for the Uni Students for Climate Change group, which is holding the march.
Australia is one of the world's largest carbon emitters per capita because of its reliance on coal-fired power plants.
In June, Australia approved a new coal mine in Queensland state by India’s Adani Enterprises, which that is expected to produce 8-10 million tonnes of thermal coal a year."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon announced on Tuesday it was halting operational training of all Saudi Arabian military personnel in the United States until further notice after a Saudi Air Force lieutenant shot and killed three people last week at a base in Florida. 
The decision will have far-reaching impacts on visiting Saudi personnel, including grounding more than 300 Saudi Arabian military aviation students as part of a ""safety stand-down,"" first reported by Reuters earlier on Tuesday. 
The Pentagon later confirmed the Reuters report about aviation students and added the move would also affect infantry personnel and all other Saudi training, other than classroom training. Such coursework, which includes English-language classes, will continue.
A senior U.S. defense official, briefing Pentagon reporters on the decision, said the move was intended to allow for a broader review of security procedures that would eventually apply to all of some 5,000 international military students in the United States.
Still, the safety standdown only applied to the some 850 visiting students from Saudi Arabia. The defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the shooting ""suggested that there could be a particular improvement with that (nation's) population.""
""I don't have any evidence to suggest that there is a larger ring or larger conspiracy,"" the official said, when asked what was driving the safety-standdown. 
The FBI has said U.S. investigators believe Saudi Air Force Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21, acted alone when he attacked a U.S. Navy base in Pensacola, Florida, on Friday, before he was fatally shot by a deputy sheriff.
The shootings have again raised questions about the U.S. military relationship with Saudi Arabia, which has come under heightened scrutiny in Congress over the war in Yemen and Saudi Arabia's killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi last year.
Still, U.S. military leaders have sought to portray this as a localized issue which would not affect the overall U.S.-Saudi relationship. 
Navy spokeswoman Lieutenant Andriana Genualdi said the safety standdown and operational pause began on Monday for Saudi Arabian aviation students.
She said the grounding included three different military facilities: Naval Air Station Pensacola, Naval Air Station Whiting Field and Naval Air Station Mayport, all in Florida. 
The Air Force said its groundings of Saudi aviation students also applied to additional U.S. bases.
""Given the traumatic events, we feel it is best to keep the Royal Saudi Air Force students off the flying schedule for a short time,"" the Air Force spokeswoman said.
Alshamrani was on the base as part of a U.S. Navy training program designed to foster links with foreign allies. He had started training in the United States in 2017 and had been in the Pensacola area for the past 18 months, authorities said.
A group that tracks online extremism has said Alshamrani appeared to have posted criticism of U.S. wars in predominantly Muslim countries and quoted slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on Twitter hours before the shooting spree.
U.S.-SAUDI RELATIONS
The attack comes as President Donald Trump's administration has maintained warm ties with Riyadh amid high tensions with Middle East rival Iran.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has dismissed suggestions that the shootings might make him more reluctant about new U.S. deployments to Saudi Arabia, which were announced in October and first reported by Reuters.
""Saudi Arabia is a longstanding partner of ours in the region. We share mutual security interests,"" Esper said over the weekend.
Esper said he had instructed the armed forces to review both security at military bases and screening for foreign soldiers who come to the United States for training after the shooting.
In the wake of the shootings, the U.S. Northern Command immediately ordered all military installations to review force protection measures and to increase ""random security measures.""
A Northern Command spokesman said local commanders in the United States also had the authority to ""add further countermeasures as needed,"" without elaborating as to which, if any, bases did so.

708,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 07:38PM ET</span>","Six dead, including a cop and two suspects, in New Jersey shooting","By Maria Caspani
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Six people, including a police officer and two suspected gunmen, were killed in an hours-long shootout that unfolded on Tuesday afternoon near a cemetery and a kosher grocery store in Jersey City, New Jersey, police said. 
The two suspects killed acted alone, Jersey City Police Chief Michael Kelly told a news conference hours later in the state's second-largest city, which sits directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan.
The two gunmen and three civilian victims were pronounced dead inside the JC Kosher Supermarket. The slain police detective was fatally wounded near a cemetery about a mile away where the shooting apparently started when he tried to intercept one of the suspects, Kelly said 
There was no immediate evidence the bloodshed was a hate crime or terror-related, he told reporters. 
Kelly said he believed the civilians and the detective were all struck by gunfire from the suspects, who arrived in a stolen U-Haul truck and held police at bay around the store for hours before the shooting ended. 
""Their movement was rapid and continuous for four hours within that area,"" the chief said at an evening news conference. He described the crime scene as ""very extensive,"" encompassing at least three locations. Hundreds of rounds were fired, he said.
Kelly said investigators believed the U-Haul vehicle contained what may have been an ""incendiary device,"" which he said was removed and taken away for examination by police bomb squad personnel.
Two more police officers and a civilian were wounded but were reported in stable condition, the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office posted on Twitter. Police said the two wounded officers were later released from the hospital.
The officer who died was identified as Joe Seals, a married father of five who had been with the Jersey City force since 2006, Mayor Steven Fulop told reporters.
The suspects fled the area of the cemetery in a truck and eventually ended up at the kosher supermarket, where they opened fire on police officers and civilians, the New York Times reported, citing officials. Investigators believe the store was chosen randomly, according to the newspaper.
The standoff prompted a massive law enforcement deployment with local SWAT teams and federal agents rushing to the scene, as well as emergency services from the neighboring New York City Police Department. 
All schools in Jersey City were placed on lockdown, which was lifted later in the afternoon, according to the mayor and local media.
""Oh my god, it's like a movie. It's crazy. ... Nothing I've ever seen before. I'm still shaking,"" an unidentified resident of the area told NBC's New York affiliate.
Kelly said the incident occurred in an ""up and coming"" neighborhood of Jersey City, a racially mixed town of about 265,000 residents.
""This neighborhood has had challenges. It has become a much safer, much better neighborhood over the last two years, three years or so,"" the police chief said. ""We can only say folks that live in the neighborhood support the police department. They were out there today showing support.” 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Twitter: ""Just received a briefing on the horrific shootout that took place in Jersey City, NJ. Our thoughts & prayers are w/ the victims & their families during this very difficult & tragic time.
""We will continue to monitor the situation as we assist local & state officials on the ground,"" Trump wrote.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 07:04PM ET</span>",Haitian slums descend into anarchy as crisis sparks worst violence in years,"By Andre Paultre and Sarah Marsh
PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Venite Bernard's feet are bloodied and torn because, she said, she had no time to grab her sandals when she fled her shack with her youngest children as gangsters roamed the Haitian capital's most notorious slum, shooting people in their homes.
Now the 47-year-old Bernard and her family are camped in the courtyard of the town hall of Cite Soleil in Port-au-Prince, along with more than 200 others, fleeing an outbreak of violence that is part of what civic leaders say is the country's worst lawlessness in more than a decade. 
""Bandits entered the homes of some people and beat them, and they were shooting,"" Bernard said through her tears, lying on a rug in the shade of a tree. ""Everyone was running so I left as quickly as I could with the children."" 
United Nations peacekeeping troops withdrew from Haiti in 2017 after 15 years, saying they had helped to re-establish law and order in the poorest country in the Americas, where nearly 60 percent of the population survives on less than $2.40 a day.
But that left a security vacuum that has been exacerbated over the past year by police forces being diverted to deal with protests against President Jovenel Moise.
""With limited resources, they have been unable to contain the activity of gangs as they might have wished,"" said Serge Therriault, U.N. police commissioner in Haiti in an interview.
An economic downturn with ballooning inflation and a lack of investment in low income districts has also helped boost crime, turning them into no-go areas.
The situation - which diplomats fear represents a growing threat to regional stability that could have knock-on effects on migration and drugs and weapons trafficking - is causing alarm in international circles.
The U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on Haiti on Tuesday, its first in 20 years.
Moise's critics say he has lost control of the country and should resign. The 51-year old says the situation is already calming down and he will carry out his full term.
Residents say gangs fight over territory where they extract ""protection"" fees and carry out drugs and arms trades.
Politicians across the spectrum are using the gangs to repress or foment dissent, providing them with weapons and impunity, according to human rights advocates and ordinary Haitians. 
""When those in power pay them, the bandits stop the population from participating in the anti-government protests,"" said Cite Soleil resident William Dorélus. ""When they receive money from the opposition, they force people to take to the streets.""
Both opposition leaders and the government deny the accusations.
IMPUNITY BREEDS CRIME
Moise said in an interview with Reuters last month he was working on strengthening Haiti's police force and had revived a commission to get gang members to disarm.
""Allegations of unlawful violence will be investigated and responded to by our justice system as a matter of priority,"" the presidency wrote in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.
Critics say, however, that under his watch, authorities have failed to prosecute gang leaders, effectively giving the criminals carte blanche and weakening the authority of police.
""Every time the police stop a gangster, there is always the intervention of some authority or another to free them,"" said Pierre Esperance, who runs Haiti's National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH) that monitors rights violations.
Esperance, who addressed Tuesday's Congress hearing, said more than 40 police officers had been killed this year, compared with 17 last year.
The most high-profile case of apparent impunity is the massacre a year ago in the neighborhood of La Saline, a hotbed of mobilization against Moise's government, according to rights advocates. 
Over two days, gangs killed at least 26 people while police failed to intervene, according to a U.N. report. Eyewitnesses cited in the report say they saw a senior government official with the gang members.
""These allegations raise the possibility of a complicity between the gangs and state authorities,"" the U.N. wrote. 
The government eventually fired the official, who denied any involvement. Neither he nor anyone else has been arrested or prosecuted over the massacre.
""This dossier (on the La Saline massacre) is in the hands of the justice system,"" Moise told Reuters.
Lo Saline residents say they feel abandoned to their fate.
""We never received an official visit after these events,"" said Marie Lourdes Corestan, 55, who said she found her 24-year old son's corpse among a pile of mutilated bodies and whose house was burnt down. ""The bandits said they would come back and not distinguish between children, women, and men.""
There have been six massacres since Moise took office, according to the RNDDH, the most recent one last month.
The U.N.'s Therriault said a recent waning of protests was allowing police officers to regain a grip on the overall security situation and Cite Soleil Mayor Jean Hislain Frederic said authorities hoped to convince people to return home next week.
But many, including Bernard, who has been unable to locate her two eldest sons, say they are too afraid.

""I hope my boys are not dead,"" she said. ""I wish for the end of this violence, and that God helps us to find somewhere to live.""

710,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 06:55PM ET</span>",U.N. unable to verify that weapons used in Saudi oil attack were from Iran,"By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations is ""unable to independently corroborate"" that missiles and drones used in attacks on Saudi oil facilities in September ""are of Iranian origin,"" Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council on Tuesday.
The United States, European powers and Saudi Arabia have blamed the Sept. 14 attack on Iran. Yemen's Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks, and Iran, which supports the Houthis, has denied any involvement.
Guterres said the United Nations examined debris of weapons used in attacks on a Saudi oil facility in Afif in May, on the Abha international airport in June and August and on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Khurais and Abqaiq in September.
""At this time, it is unable to independently corroborate that the cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles used in these attacks are of Iranian origin,"" he wrote in the report, seen by Reuters.
The attacks that targeted the Abqaiq and the Khurais oil plants caused a spike in oil prices, fires and damage and shut down more than 5% of global oil supply. Saudi Arabia said on Oct. 3 that it had fully restored oil output.
U.N. experts monitoring Security Council sanctions on Iran and Yemen traveled to Saudi Arabia days after the Sept. 14 attack.
The report noted that Yemen's Houthis ""have not shown to be in possession, nor been assessed to be in possession"" of the type of drones used in the attacks on the Aramco facilities.
    Guterres reports twice a year to the Security Council on the implementation of an arms embargo on Iran and other restrictions that remained in place after Tehran agreed to a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015.
The council is due to discuss his report next week.
    A separate independent panel also reports twice a year to the Security Council on the implementation of sanctions related to the conflict in Yemen that were imposed in 2014 and 2015. That report is due next month.
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in New York in September that his country had consulted with its allies on what steps to take after the attacks.
""The United Nations sent people to be part of the investigation, other countries have sent experts to be part of the investigation,"" he said then. ""When the team that's investigating has concluded its investigations we will make the announcements publicly."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's election race has tightened markedly over the past two weeks and Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now likely to win only a modest majority in Thursday's vote, according to a closely watched forecast released on Tuesday.
The 28-seat Conservative margin of victory predicted by pollsters YouGov, down from 68 two weeks ago, is narrow enough that the firm said Johnson could fail to win an outright majority, given the uncertainties inherent to forecasting - an outcome that would prolong Brexit uncertainty.
""Based on the model, we cannot rule out a hung parliament,"" Anthony Wells, YouGov's director of political research, told The Times newspaper, which published the results.
Johnson called the election to break what he viewed as a deadlock in parliament, where his minority administration had been unable to pass legislation governing Britain's departure from the European Union, which has been delayed until Jan. 31.
Sterling fell sharply after the forecasts appeared, dropping by more than half a cent against the dollar  after hitting a seven-month high against the U.S. currency earlier in the day.
""Given the margin for error in this poll, as well as the trend which has shown a clear narrowing of the majority ... Thursday's election outcome is far from a foregone conclusion,"" said David Cheetham, chief market analyst at brokers XTB.
Earlier on Tuesday, a similar forecasting model from a smaller market research company, Focalpoint, showed Johnson on track for a 24-seat majority, down from the majority of 82 seats which it predicted last month. 
Many analysts view a 'hung parliament' as the most negative outcome for Britain's economy, at least in the short run, with no party able to resolve the Brexit impasse. 
Two weeks ago, YouGov predicted the Conservatives would win 359 seats in Britain's 650-seat parliament, enough to give a comfortable majority of 68, but now it sees the party winning 339, a smaller improvement from its 2017 result of 317.
The main opposition Labour Party are still seen losing ground, but by less than before, and they are forecast to hold on to 231 of the 262 seats they won in 2017. The Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats are forecast to gain a handful of seats each.
YouGov's forecasts are based on more than 100,000 interviews with voters over the past week.
The so-called multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) modeling approach - which factors in voters' age, gender, education and other variables to predict results in every British voting district - enjoyed success in 2017.

In late May 2017, just over a week before the June 8 election, YouGov's model correctly projected the then Prime Minister Theresa May would lose the Conservative Party's majority, even though she had been ahead in most polls.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 05:42PM ET</span>",Father's energy legacy haunts Canada's Trudeau as he seeks to heal rift with angry Alberta,"By David Ljunggren
(Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has an unusual challenge as he seeks to charm angry westerners who fear he will destroy the region's oil and gas industry - the legacy of his father, who was reviled in much of the west for his energy policies.
Pierre Trudeau, also a Liberal prime minister, pushed through a series of measures in 1980 to artificially depress the price of oil and help the more populous and politically influential east, in what is now the fourth largest oil producer in the world.
People in Alberta, home to 80% of Canada's oil production, saw the moves as an expansion of an effort to enrich the east by capitalizing on the west's resource wealth, and drove around with bumper stickers that read: ""Let the Eastern bastards freeze in the dark"".
The memory of that era lives on in Alberta, which is now run by a right-leaning government led by Jason Kenney, an ambitious former Conservative defense minister who is in Ottawa this week to press Trudeau for more energy-friendly policies.
Kenney said last month that Trudeau's government was ""actively hostile"" to the energy industry and its workers and ignoring all the revenue generated by oil and gas. 
""They need to understand that they're killing the golden goose. They have both fists wrapped around the throat of that goose,"" he said in a speech in Ottawa. 
Trudeau has seen a return of the enmities his father faced almost four decades ago, when he expanded a state-owned oil and gas company and introduced the so-called National Energy Program (NEP), which cut investments and jobs in Alberta.
""The anger is very similar, the alienation is very similar - I would argue it is actually deeper and broader than it was in the 1980s,"" said Martha Hall Findlay, a former Liberal legislator now at the Calgary-based Canada West Foundation, a non-partisan public policy think tank.
Trudeau's previous government introduced tough new environmental assessment rules for energy infrastructure. In the October national election, Trudeau lost his majority and failed to win a single seat in Alberta.
Critics also charge that Trudeau, who has promised to make Canada carbon neutral by 2050, failed to expand a pipeline to the Pacific coast crucial to getting Alberta's landlocked oil to international markets, even though the government spent C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion) to buy the project to ensure it went ahead.
An Ipsos poll last month showed some 33% of Albertans backed the idea of separation from the rest of the country, up from 23% in September 2018.
Trudeau has said however that most Canadians voted in October for parties who promised to clamp down on emissions.
RALLY THE SUSPICIONS
""The NEP is one of those instant memories available for people who want to rally the suspicions ... it never goes away because it's useful,"" said University of Alberta political science professor Roger Epp.
In a bid to repair ties, Trudeau moved key ally Chrystia Freeland - who was born and raised in Alberta - from the foreign ministry to the post of intergovernmental affairs, where she will be his point person with the province.
But a senior conservative in Alberta said while Kenney and other provincial premiers were prepared to work with Freeland, they would ultimately want to deal with Trudeau.
""A prime minister can't fob off his relations with a premier on a minister,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. Kenney is due to meet Trudeau face-to-face on Tuesday.
The NEP, which was killed off in 1985 after oil prices came down, hurt Pierre Trudeau, who stepped down in June 1984 after almost 16 years in power. Three months later, under his successor, the Liberals suffered a record electoral defeat.
Duane Bratt, a politics professor at Calgary's Mount Royal University, said Justin Trudeau's predicament is more ""tragic"" because ""he was much more aware of that history and has fallen into the same trap.""

The prime minister's office did not address the historic parallels between father and son, but spokesman Matt Pascuzzo said: ""We have been focused on delivering results for energy sector workers and communities, while taking real action to deliver a cleaner economy.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday the Trump administration was ""hopeful"" North Korea will continue to work toward denuclearization and refrain from long-range missile tests, as Pyongyang's deadline for Washington to reconsider its approach to talks looms.
Speaking at a joint news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Pompeo also said Washington was looking for ways to talk to Pyongyang but offered no signs that the two sides were any closer to returning to the negotiating table.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has set a year-end deadline for the United States to be more flexible in denuclearization negotiations or risk Pyongyang taking a ""new path."" 
What exactly that path may be is unclear, but experts say North Korea could restart intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) testing suspended since 2017 and put the two countries back on a collision course, as they were before Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump held their first summit last year.
Pyongyang has ratcheted up the tensions with recently with a series of weapons tests, and has resumed its personal insults against Trump. 
""Chairman Kim personally made the commitment to denuclearize, so there wouldn't be long-range missile tests, nuclear tests,"" Pompeo said when asked whether the United States expected North Korea to return to a more aggressive posture.
""All of those are commitments that we are very hopeful that the North Koreans will continue to abide by,"" Pompeo said, adding that Washington was seeking to develop ""negotiation mechanisms where we can talk to them about paths forward.""
Kim made only vague commitments on denuclearization at his first summit with Trump in Singapore and diplomacy has since stalled. North Korea wants the United States to stop insisting that Pyongyang abandon its nuclear weapons program unilaterally and wants relief from punishing sanctions.
North Korean ruling party vice chairman Kim Yong Chol on Monday called Trump a ""heedless and erratic old man.""
The comments by Kim, who was instrumental in arranging a failed second summit in February, came a day after Pyongyang announced a ""very important"" test of an unspecified device. Satellite imagery indicated on Monday it may have been a rocket engine.
Trump tweeted on Sunday that Kim risks losing ""everything"" if he resumes hostility and that his country must denuclearize.

Lavrov said progress between the United States and North Korea was only possible if the two sides took ""reciprocal steps."" But he also said: ""We call on the North Korean leadership to show restraint.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Russia appeared no closer on Tuesday to settling their disagreements on nuclear arms control as Moscow again proposed extending their New START treaty and Washington insisted China must be brought into the framework.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov largely stuck to their existing positions as they described talks that ranged from alleged Russian interference in U.S. elections to the wars in Ukraine and Syria, North Korea's nuclear program and improving economic ties.
At a joint news conference, Pompeo said the United States believed other parties, such as China, needed to be brought in to a wider arms control discussion, and he said he would consider a Russian proposal to include nuclear powers Britain and France.
""There is real risk that there is a reduction in strategic stability just staying right where we are,"" Pompeo said, arguing that delivery systems have evolved beyond the missiles, bombers and submarines covered by the New START treaty signed in 2010.
""Not only do the conversations need to be broadened to include the Chinese Communist Party, but they need to be broadened as well to encompass the full range of instruments of power...."" 
Lavrov repeated Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to extend New START, which requires both nations to cut their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550. The treaty expires in February 2021 but can be extended for up to five years by mutual consent.
""The ball is in our American partners’ court,"" Lavrov said before going to the White House to see President Donald Trump.
The two met as Democrats in the House of Representatives announced formal impeachment charges against Trump that accuse him of abusing power by pressuring Ukraine to probe a political rival and obstructing the Congress investigation into the scandal. 
Their last Oval Office meeting in May 2017 turned into a public relations disaster for Trump, who was accused by unnamed U.S. officials of divulging highly classified information during that meeting about a planned operation by the Islamic State militant group. The allegations were denied by the White House.
Trump was also blasted for media reports that he told Russian officials firing FBI Director James Comey had relieved him of ""great pressure."" Comey's dismissal ultimately led to a 22-month investigation by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The inquiry laid bare what Mueller and U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a Russian campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States, denigrate 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump, the Kremlin's preferred candidate.

Pompeo told reporters interference in U.S. domestic affairs ""is unacceptable and I made our expectations of Russia clear"" while Lavrov repeated Russian denials that Moscow had tampered in U.S. elections.

The Senate's constitution and justice committee voted 22-1 for an amendment that would fix in stone a judicial rule that is seen to be crucial in ending impunity due to drawn-out lawsuits and a huge backlog in court cases.
Last month, the Supreme Court, in a 6-5 decision, overturned a three-year-old rule that it itself had established sending convicted criminals to prison after losing their first appeal and cutting short endless processes.
That Nov. 7 ruling allowed Lula to obtain his release the next day, pending appeals against two convictions for corruption. Businessmen convicted of paying bribes and kickbacks in the so-called Car Wash corruption scandal were also freed.
Lula's release angered supporters of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro and other Brazilians who want to see an end to political corruption, and that prompted lawmakers to advance bills to restore a stricter rule on appeals.
""This vote resulted from the growing awareness of the issue among lawmakers, to the relief of many Brazilians,"" said Senator Lasier Martins, author of the bill. He urged senators to put the bill to a vote in the Senate plenary this week so that the lower chamber can deal with it before the year is over.
But the house has its own bill going through committee debates that is more likely to make the statute books because it seeks the same outcome by changing the penal code instead of amending the constitution and needs fewer votes to get approved."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday said Moscow wanted to publish a cache of communications with Washington that he said cleared Russia of allegations it interfered in the 2016 U.S. election, but that the United States has blocked their release. 
During a joint news conference with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Lavrov once again dismissed the American accusation that Moscow tried to sway the 2016 election, which resulted in the upset victory of President Donald Trump.
""We suggested to our colleagues that in order to dispel all suspicions that are baseless: Let us publish this close channel of correspondence starting from October 2016 until November 2017 so it would all become very clear to many people,"" Lavrov said through an interpreter at the news conference.
""However, regrettably, this administration refused to do so,"" added Lavrov, who has begun his meeting with Trump at the White House. ""We are prepared to do that, to publish the correspondence that took place.""
It was not immediately clear what communications Lavrov was referring to. He said Moscow ""used the channels that existed"" between Washington and Moscow at the time in 2016 with the Obama administration, and had got ""zero response"" when it appealed for an opportunity to directly discuss the allegations.
U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian state meddled in the election campaign, and a number of Russian citizens and entities were charged by then-U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Russia has long denied interfering in the run-up to the November 2016 election in which Republican Trump was the surprise winner against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. 
Standing next to Lavrov at the news conference, Pompeo warned Moscow against interfering in next November's U.S. election.
""I was clear it is unacceptable and I made our expectations of Russia clear. The Trump administration will always work to protect the integrity of our elections, period. Should Russia or any foreign actor take steps to undermine our democratic processes, we will take action in response,"" he said.
Lavrov ignored shouted questions from reporters on whether Russia will interfere in the 2020 elections as he entered the White House.

On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department's internal watchdog said that it found numerous errors but no evidence of political bias by the FBI when it opened an investigation into contacts between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia in 2016.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on the leader of an Islamist rebel group and five others on Tuesday for perpetrating serious human rights abuses including mass rape, torture and killings in eastern Congo, the U.S. Treasury said.
Congolese officials have accused the rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), who are originally from Uganda, of killing more than 100 people in a series of raids on villages over the last six weeks, hampering efforts to end an Ebola epidemic in the area.
The group has been fighting in the dense jungles of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo since the mid-1990s, where it has carried out massacres, kidnappings and looting, often in collaboration with other local militias and leaders.
According to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), ADF leader Musa Baluku assisted the group ""through recruitment, logistics, administration, financing, intelligence, and operations coordination"".
The ADF ""continues to perpetuate widespread violence and innumerable human rights abuses including the abduction, recruitment, and use of children during attacks and other violent operations"".
The sanctions allow the U.S. government to seize any property or accounts the fighters have in the U.S. and prohibits anyone in the U.S. from doing business with them.
""These sanctions will help expose the financial network of ADF rebels around the world and whether they are involved in money laundering in the region,"" Carly Nzanzu Kasivita, governor of North Kivu province, told Reuters by telephone.
Baluku took over the group after its former leader Jamil Mukulu was arrested in Tanzania four years ago.
Since then several ADF attacks have been claimed by Islamic State, although there is a lack of hard evidence linking the two groups said Daniel Fahey, visiting professor at the U.S. University of Notre Dame in Indiana.
""ISIS claims are worth noting, but also appear to be aspirational -- asserting their relevance at a time when they have grown weaker and lost territorial control,"" said Fahey, a former member of the UN panel of experts on Congo.
""Sanctions are unlikely to have much impact in the short-term, but they are a sign that the U.S. government is taking seriously the violence in Beni, and pursuing non-military means to address it,"" he told Reuters by email.
The army began large-scale operations to uproot the ADF on October 30, triggering a surge in alleged reprisal attacks on civilians.

721,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 03:01PM ET</span>",U.S. slaps sanctions on Myanmar military chief over Rohingya atrocities,"By Daphne Psaledakis and Simon Lewis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on four Myanmar military leaders, including the commander-in-chief, in the toughest action taken yet by Washington for alleged human rights abuses against the Rohingya and other minorities.
The sanctions targeted military chief Min Aung Hlaing on the same day that Myanmar's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, attended the first day hearings at the U.N.'s highest court in The Hague, where she will lead Myanmar's defense against the charge of genocide.
A 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar drove more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. United Nations investigators have said Myanmar's operation included mass killings, gang rapes and widespread arson and was executed with ""genocidal intent.""
Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, denied accusations of widespread abuses and said the military's actions were part of a fight against terrorism.
The U.S Treasury Department said in a statement on Tuesday Burmese military forces had committed ""serious human rights abuse"" under Min Aung Hlaing's command.
""During this time, members of ethnic minority groups were killed or injured by gunshot, often while fleeing, or by soldiers using large-bladed weapons; others were burned to death in their own houses,"" the statement said.
MAGNITSKY ACT
The sanctions Tuesday were among a round of targets implemented under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuses and corruption, marking International Human Rights Day.
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets held by those targeted and prohibits Americans from doing business with them.
As well as the army chief, the sanctions targeted Min Aung Hlaing's deputy, Soe Win, and two subordinates who headed the elite army divisions that spearheaded the crackdown on the Rohingya.
A Reuters special report last year detailed for the first time the leading role of the two units, the 33rd Light Infantry Division, led by Than Oo, and the 99th Light Infantry Division, led by Aung Aung, in the 2017 conflict.
The 33rd Light Infantry Division led military operations in the village of Inn Din, where Reuters exposed a massacre of 10 Rohingya men and boys by soldiers and Buddhist villagers. Two Reuters reporters that worked on the story were jailed for more than 500 days.

It is not known whether the four generals, who were previously barred from entering the United States in July, have assets in the United States.
Myanmar's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The additional sanctions come months after Washington faced criticism by U.N. special rapport Yanghee Lee in July, who said the earlier travel ban was not enough.
John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, called it a welcome but overdue step, saying ""better late than never.""
""It is unfortunate the decision took so long. The crimes in question were incredibly serious,"" he said. ""If the EU follows suit with similar measures and works with the US to press other jurisdictions to crack down, soon the Myanmar military will find that their world is geographically and financially shrinking.""
The Treasury said the fresh sanctions were aimed at supporting a transition toward democracy in Myanmar, where Nobel laureate Suu Kyi came to power after landmark elections in 2015.
Suu Kyi is forced to share power with unelected generals over whom she has little control, but has remained popular at home despite international criticism over the Rohingya crisis.
Some analysts and diplomats have tipped Min Aung Hlaing as a potential presidential candidate in the next election in 2020, when Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy is likely to face opposition from nationalists aligned with the military.
The U.S. action on Tuesday falls short of reimposing economic sanctions on Myanmar lifted after the military began loosening its grip on power. It does not target military-owned companies that dominate some sectors of Myanmar's economy.
Mark Farmaner, director of Burma Campaign UK, an advocacy group, said these military-owned companies were still doing business with U.S. firms.
""Military-owned companies are helping to fund the genocide against the Rohingya. It is essential they face sanctions,"" he told Reuters by email."

""Iranian citizens, particularly elites and scientists, are requested to seriously avoid traveling to America, even to take part in scientific conferences and even having an invitation,"" a travel advisory on the foreign ministry website said.
It cited, ""America's cruel and one-sided laws toward Iranians, especially Iranian elites, and arbitrary and lengthy detention in completely inhuman conditions"" as reasons for the travel advisory.
The United States and Iran on Saturday swapped prisoners - American graduate student Xiyue Wang, detained for three years on spying charges, and imprisoned Iranian stem-cell researcher Massoud Soleimani, accused of sanction violations - in a rare act of cooperation between two longtime foes.
Soleimani was arrested upon arrival in the U.S. last year after being invited to take part in a research program at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
Several dozen other Iranians are being held in U.S. prisons, many of them for breaking sanctions.
Washington has demanded that Iran release the Americans it is holding, including father and son Siamak and Baquer Namazi; Michael R. White, a Navy veteran imprisoned last year; and Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent missing since 2007.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Monday the Islamic republic is ready for a full prisoner exchange with the United States, tweeting: “The ball is in the US’ court”.
Tensions have heightened between Iran and the United States since U.S. President Donald Trump last year pulled Washington out of the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Tehran’s economy. Iran has responded by gradually scaling back its commitments under the agreement.

723,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 02:25PM ET</span>",Dissidents say Cuba put them under house arrest on Human Rights Day,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Opposition activists and independent journalists in Communist-run Cuba said state security and police stopped them from leaving their homes on Tuesday to prevent them marking or reporting on international Human Rights Day.
Some activists had planned to observe the day by calling publicly for the liberation of one of the top opposition leaders in the one-party country, Jose Daniel Ferrer, whom Cuba calls a U.S.-financed counterrevolutionary.
Cuban authorities arrested Ferrer, 49, more than two months ago. While dissidents complain they are frequently subjected to short-term detentions to intimidate them, his is the first long-term arrest of a high profile government critic in years.
Human rights activists say it reflects a broader increase in repression as the country deals with an awakening of civil awareness thanks to expanded access to the internet and a hike in U.S. sanctions.
International rights organizations like Amnesty International, the Trump administration and the European Parliament have called for Ferrer's release.
""'Go back up to your flat because today you cannot go out' said a state security official guarding the entrance of my building,"" wrote Luz Escobar, a reporter for the alternative news website 14ymedio, on Twitter.
The Cuban government, which says its critics on human rights overlook Cuba’s guaranteed healthcare and education, did not reply to request for comment.
Cuba says the United States is using Ferrer - with its top diplomat in Havana even abetting his illegal activities - to undermine the government as part of its broader attempt to overthrow socialism in Latin America.
Activists from Ferrer's Patriotic Union of Cuba called this week for his release and that of other UNPACU members in a campaign on social media.
""There is a continued vigilance as is usual on this day ... as part of a broader police operation to stop actions in favor of Ferrer,"" said UNPACU spokesman Carlos Amel Oliva.
The Day of Human Rights coincides with the implementation on Tuesday of a new U.S. ban on all U.S. scheduled flights to Cuban destinations except Havana. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Twitter this would hurt Cuban families living on either side of the Florida Straits and violated their rights."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Tuesday he is still not fully convinced that the FBI acted without bias when it opened its 2016 investigation into possible links between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia.
In his first interview since a report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz faulting the FBI for missteps in how it sought to put a former Trump campaign adviser under surveillance, Barr said he still has doubts about the FBI's motives to pursue what he called a ""baseless"" investigation.
The internal watchdog's report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/mistakes-but-no-political-bias-in-fbi-probe-of-trump-campaign-watchdog-idUSKBN1YD11L on Monday also concluded that the FBI had opened a legal, authorized probe, and it found no evidence of political bias.
Barr, in an interview with NBC News, however, cast doubt on the findings.
He said Horowitz used a standard that was ""deferential"" to the FBI when he investigated the claims of bias, and suggested that a final judgment cannot be made until federal prosecutor John Durham has completed his own separate investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.
""I think our nation was turned on its head for three years based on a completely bogus narrative that was largely fanned and hyped by a completely irresponsible press,"" Barr said.
""I think that leaves open the possibility that there was bad faith.""
Barr also said he was disturbed by the FBI's reliance on a dossier penned by former British spy Christopher Steele in order to obtain a wiretap to monitor the campaign adviser Carter Page, saying the dossier was ""complete rubbish"" and a ""complete sham.""
Barr has come under withering criticism from Democrats, who have accused him of acting more like Trump's personal attorney and not like the Attorney General of the United States.
Earlier this year, Barr tapped Durham, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, to look into the origins of the investigation into Trump's campaign. 
Durham's probe is broader than Horowitz's mandate because it involves talking to multiple U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the CIA, and foreign powers. 
Durham, unlike Horowitz, also has the power to subpoena non-government witnesses and talk to people who are not Justice Department employees.

Barr told NBC that while he is not sure when Durham will complete his investigation, he expects it to reach an important ""watershed"" in the late spring or early summer.

Since taking power in 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has implemented sweeping political reforms that have won him praise but also lifted the lid on long-repressed tensions between Ethiopia's many ethnic groups.
In October, 86 people were killed and 409 detained during protests against the treatment of a prominent activist.
""We have decided to deploy federal police to all 45 public universities across the country because the security situation could not be managed by campus security, some of whom were implicated in violent clashes,"" Ministry of Science and Higher Education spokesman Dechassa Gurmu said.
He said five campus security guards had been arrested as of Tuesday for taking part in violent clashes with students.
Dechassa said he did not know how many officers would be deployed nationwide, or for what period.
Last year, ethnic violence forced more than 2 million people from their homes and killed hundreds, the United Nations and monitoring groups say.
On Tuesday, Abiy collected the Nobel Peace Prize for forging a peace accord that ended two decades of hostility with Eritrea."

Speakers at the protest in Prague by the Million Moments for Democracy civic group demanded Babis's former business empire Agrofert be cut off from European Union subsidies and public contracts, and they called on Babis to resign. 
Tuesday's protest was called after the country's top prosecutor reopened last week a case against Babis, suspecting that he hid ownership of one of his firms a decade ago so it would qualify for a 2 million euro subsidy.
Separately, an audit by the European Commission, the European Union's executive, leaked to Czech media last week, showed the Commission saw Babis in conflict of interest because he still had control over Agrofert, a conglomerate of hundreds of firms he had built over the past two decades and put into trust funds in 2017.
Babis, 65 and in power since 2017, denies any wrongdoing in the criminal case and also repeatedly said he met all legal requirements on conflict of interest by setting up the fund structure. 
The protest group, set up by students, had brought a quarter of a million people to the streets in Prague twice earlier this year in the biggest demonstrations of the country's 30-year post-communist era.
The protest on Tuesday at Prague's central Wenceslas Square (NYSE:SQ) was smaller, numbering several tens of thousands according to a Reuters' estimate, and 60,000 according to the organizers. 
""A liar under investigation has no business being in the post of prime minister,"" Benjamin Roll from Million Moments for Democracy told the crowd.
""The European Commission audit speaks clearly: Andrej Babis abuses political power for his own business,"" he added.
Despite the protests, Babis's populist ANO movement remains by far the most popular political party with around 30 percent of the vote, drawing support among older voters and regions outside the capital.

His firms span farming, food processing, chemicals and media, and are among the central European country's main recipients of various EU money, from farm subsidies that are given per hectare or per animal to project-based finance for innovation and environmental investments.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Demonstrators braved freezing temperatures on Tuesday to protest against the awarding of the 2019 Nobel Prize for Literature to Austrian writer Peter Handke because of his support for the late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.
Handke and the Nobel laureates in chemistry, medicine, physics and economics received their prizes from the Swedish king in a lavish ceremony at Stockholm Concert Hall on Tuesday evening. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded separately earlier on Tuesday in Oslo to Ethiopia's prime minister.
The Swedish Academy's choice of Handke has been widely criticized because the Austrian novelist and playwright spoke at the funeral of Milosevic in 2006 after the Serbian leader died in detention in The Hague while facing trial for war crimes.
As dignitaries arrived in limousines, about a dozen protesters waved placards with slogans such as ""No Nobel for Fake News"", a reference to comments by Handke questioning the massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995. 
The protest was expected to swell later to several hundred.
""The problem with Handke is his refusal to admit genocide on the Bosnian population in the 1990s,"" said Adnan Mahmutović, one of the organizers of Tuesday's demonstration in Stockholm.
""As a serious, established writer who has a lot of clout in European literature Handke has been used in the narrative of genocide denial in the Balkans,"" said Mahmutovic, who fled to Sweden as a refugee from the war in Bosnia in 1993.
The ambassadors of Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo and Turkey said they would boycott Tuesday's ceremony.
""AMNESIA""
""Today is a shameful day... It shows that Europe has an amnesia of what happened to us in Kosovo, Bosnia and Croatia,"" Kosovo’s Foreign Minister Behgjet Pacolli wrote on Twitter.
Earlier, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused the Swedish Academy of rewarding human rights violations by awarding the literature prize to Handke.
At the time of his death, Milosevic had been on trial over atrocities and ethnic cleansing committed by Serb forces during the wars that tore apart the old Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
Last Friday Handke dismissed questions about his support for Milosevic. Handke is the author of books such as ""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" and ""Slow Homecoming"". He also co-wrote the script of the critically acclaimed 1987 film ""Wings of Desire"".

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Social Democrat Sanna Marin said on Tuesday she would restore stability to Finland and keep using social media - but with care - after being sworn in as the world's youngest prime minister at the helm of a government led by women.
Marin, 34, won a confidence vote in parliament, with 99 in favor and 70 against, and will head a coalition government in which four of the five parties are led by women and 12 of the 19 members of the new cabinet are women.
A former transport minister, she takes over during a wave of labor unrest and strikes that have halted production at some of Finland's largest companies for three days. 
Marin said recreating trust between the coalition partners would be one of her first tasks after her predecessor, Antti Rinne, lost their confidence over his handling of a postal strike and resigned last week.
""This is our opportunity to tell who we Finns are and what kind of country Finland is,"" Marin told reporters in the Finnish capital, Helsinki. ""The government's responsibility is to create stability in society.""
One challenge is likely to be defending the views of her leftist Social Democrats against the Centre Party, which wants action to boost employment to pay for the costly welfare state.
Marin did not give details of how she would recreate trust but said: ""It demands discussion, a direct one."" 
Defending her frequent use of social media, she said: ”I present a younger generation but of course, when it comes to social media or Instagram, I think that I’m an individual, a person, a real person even though I’m a prime minister.""
""So I won’t change the way I behave. Of course I have to be careful in what I say,” said Marin, who posted pictures of herself pregnant and later with her child, now two, on Instagram. 
She made no reference to other leaders, such as U.S. President Donald Trump, who frequently use social media and sometimes attract criticism over their online comments.
ADVICE FROM YOUNG AND OLD 
The head of the Centre Party, Katri Kulmuni, 32, becomes finance minister, Green Party leader Maria Ohisalo, 34, continues as interior minister and the Left Alliance's chairwoman, Li Andersson, 32, remains education minister.
""Finland has truly taken the gender issues to the next level,"" Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Union's executive Commission, said in a tweet congratulating Marin.
The Social Democrats came out on top in an election on April 14 for the first time in 20 years but with only 17.7 percent of the vote. 
The previous coalition resigned after failing to push through a healthcare reform and confidence in politicians has been hit by quarrels between the increasingly fragmented parties, under growing pressure from the nationalist Finns Party.
""I'm proud that we have a young female prime minister. I think that is a good thing and a step in the right direction for sure,"" said a student from the city of Espoo who gave her name only as Heini.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, at 94 the world's oldest serving premier, offered Marin some advice.
""While we believe in the idealism of young people, it is important also for them to consider the experience of the old people,"" he told Reuters. ""Then there will be a combination of the two, and that would be good.""

The website, whose name translated as ""Tour of the Wolf Pack"", laid out the route taken in Pamplona by five men who attacked an 18-year-old woman early in the morning at the San Fermin festival in 2016. 
The site was created in December 2018, months after a court cleared the five men of gang rape - a decision that led to mass protests and catapulted the issue of sexual assault into the national conversation. 
Calling themselves the Wolf Pack, the men had recorded video of the attack on their mobile phones and later laughed about it on social media. 
In June, the Supreme Court overturned the lower court decision, ruling that the five men were guilty of rape and sentenced them to 15 years in prison.
The court in Navarra ordered the website creator, a Madrid resident who was identified only by his initials, to also pay 15,000 euros ($16,500) to the victim in damages. The site turned the rape into ""amusement, an irony, creating additional suffering"" for the victim, the judge said in a statement. 
""She saw her suffering exposed, minimized, trivialized ... in a clear disregard for her dignity,"" the judge added. 
The court noted that the website creator can appeal against the sentence.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 12:07PM ET</span>",Alberto Fernandez: political broker to Argentina's main man,"By Nicolás Misculin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Alberto Fernandez has pulled off something of a coup. The fixer and confidante of presidents, little known outside Argentine political circles just half a year ago, took on the top job in Latin American's No. 3 economy on Tuesday.
The moderate Peronist, a fan of Bob Dylan, after whom he named his brown-and-white collie, now needs to pull off an even tougher maneuver with the country gripped by default fears, inflation and flat-lined growth.
Fernandez, who beat out the conservative incumbent Mauricio Macri in an October election, was sworn into office on Tuesday, a meteoric rise for the university professor who was announced as a candidate in May by his higher-profile running mate, ex-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
""We know we will be traveling a narrow, complex, challenging path where there is room neither for magic dogmas nor for sectarian infighting,"" Fernandez said in his speech to Congress.
People who know Fernandez say his negotiating skills honed over years as a political operator will be key.
""He is an intelligent man, with good training, who listens, who dialogues, who defends his point of view,"" said former Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana, who between 2003 and 2008 served in the same cabinet as 60-year-old lawyer and teacher Fernandez.
""I never saw him have a dogmatic position.""
Beyond the election, the country is set for complex discussions with its creditors, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), after a crash in the peso currency left Argentina on the edge of default as reserves sank and borrowing costs jumped.
That crash was sparked ironically by Fernandez's own, unexpected landslide victory in a primary election vote against Macri in August, as investors worried about his populist running mate and question marks over Fernandez's own policy views.
TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN'
Fernandez's flexibility has helped him unite the nebulous Peronist political flank, his gentler, man-of-the-people image helping lure middle-ground voters worried about the return of the divisive Fernández de Kirchner.
He had continued to oversee exams until recently at the University of Buenos Aires, where he teaches.
In a reflection of his chameleon-like mutability, Fernández has been both a lawmaker for Buenos Aires in a party of neo-liberals, a Peronist chief of staff and part of the Radical Civic Union party in the 1980s.
That is reflected in an eclectic taste in music. Behind the austere mustache and formal suit he wears as a law school professor, Fernandez hides a rock-loving musician who turns to the guitar every time Argentine politics let up.
He is a ""music freak, a very cultured guy,"" Argentine rock pioneer Lito Nebbia - an idol and later a friend - said of the Peronist candidate in a radio interview this year.
Asked about his ideological influences, Fernández said in a radio interview that they included more obvious political thinkers such as former President Juan Peron, the ideological father of Peronism, but also a string of South American and North American musicians.
""But there's also a lot of Nebbia, Bob Dylan, Joan Báez, and El Flaco (Luis Alberto) Spinetta,"" said Fernandez, who as a 16-year-old teenager grew his mustache in honor of Nebbia and even took guitar lessons with him.
A REAL PERONIST?
A big question for many - investors, farmers and voters - has been how burnished are Fernandez's Peronist credentials? Their concerns range from fears he could be a puppet for more extreme ""Kirchnerist"" views to worries he's not Peronist enough.
Peronism is a broad political movement that spans across the political spectrum but is grounded in an idea of ""social justice.""
""I don't like him. In his head he's not a Peronist. Alberto's economics are neo-liberal,"" Guillermo Moreno, a former secretary of commerce who was in the cabinet with Fernandez for years, said earlier this year.
Fernández, raised in a family of lawyers, has worked within Peronism for years. He was chief of staff under husband-and-wife pair Néstor Kirchner from 2003-2007, and the first year of Cristina Fernández, who ruled from 2007 until 2015.
Fernandez is also a fanatic for Argentinos Juniors soccer club, whose stadium stands a few blocks from the house where he grew up in the Villa del Parque neighborhood of Buenos Aires.
The relationship with his running mate is also complex. He was sharply critical of Cristina Fernández during her administration, which saw the introduction of populist policies including currency controls, as well as limits and taxes slapped onto farm imports.
The pair reconciled last year and have used their differences to great effect to sweep back into the Casa Rosada presidential palace. Whether it lasts is another question.
""Until the (mid-term) elections in 2021 there will be no problems, the alliance will be maintained. But I don't know what will happen in 2023,"" a source close to Fernández de Kirchner told Reuters, referring to the next general election.
For now, Fernandez is basking in the glow of leading what was a fragmented Peronist opposition back to power.
""Alberto is just the best candidate,"" deputy José Luis Gioja, leader of the Peronist Justicialist Party (PJ), told Reuters. ""He greatly helped the unity of the PJ and the country's progressives."""

""The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was a heinous, unacceptable crime,"" the Department said in a statement, adding that it continued to urge the Saudi government to conduct a ""full, fair and transparent"" trial to hold accountable those responsible for the former Washington Post columnist's death.
Khashoggi was a U.S. resident and a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, where he was to receive papers ahead of his wedding. His body was reportedly dismembered and removed from the building, and his remains have not been found.
The killing caused a global uproar, tarnishing the crown prince's image. The CIA and some Western governments have said they believe Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, but Saudi officials say he had no role. Eleven Saudi suspects have been put on trial over his death in secretive proceedings in Riyadh.
But President Donald Trump has expressed doubts about the CIA assessment and argued that Washington must not risk its alliance with Riyadh, the cornerstone of U.S. security policy in the Gulf and regarded as a regional counterweight to Iran.
The United States has deployed additional American military forces to the kingdom to bolster its defenses after the Sept. 14 attack on its oil facilities, which Washington and Riyadh have blamed on Iran.
Many members of the U.S. Congress, however, have questioned the longstanding U.S.-Saudi security alliance and backed several efforts - which have failed so far - to stop Trump from selling arms to the kingdom without congressional approval or providing support to the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen.
Such worries have increased further after the Khashoggi killing.
""We will continue to seek all relevant facts, consult Congress, and work with other nations to hold accountable those involved in the killing,"" the State Department said.
Otaibi previously was the subject of a U.S. asset freeze for his alleged role in Khashoggi's death. The designation also bars his family members from entering the United States."

MONS, Belgium (Reuters) - The United States will send 20,000 troops to Europe next April and May in its biggest military exercises on European soil since the Cold War to underscore Washington's commitment to NATO, a senior allied commander said on Tuesday.
Days after a NATO summit in London at which U.S. President Donald Trump called low-spending European allies ""delinquent"", U.S. Major General Barre Seguin said the exercises, centered on Germany, will be the largest of their kind in 25 years.
""This really demonstrates transatlantic unity and the U.S. commitment to NATO,"" Seguin, who oversees allied operations from NATO's military headquarters in Belgium, told Reuters.
Eager to deter Russia from any repeat of its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, the U.S. Army will test its ability to transport the soldiers across the Atlantic to Belgium and the Netherlands and then move quickly east through Germany into Poland and along NATO's eastern flank.
The soldiers will join U.S. personnel stationed across the continent, as well as militaries from 18 NATO allies, to mass around 37,000 troops, before returning to the United States, in an echo of the 'Return of Forces to Germany', or 'REFORGER' maneuvers, of the 1980s.
""We have not demonstrated this ability to rapidly reinforce, from a transatlantic perspective ... for 25 years or so,"" said Seguin, saying he recalled the REFORGER maneuvers as a boy in school in Germany.
NATO has already sent battalions to the Baltics and Poland to deter potential Russian incursions but now aims to be able to sustain any military operations. European governments are also spending more on making troops combat-ready.
Russia says it has no intention of attacking NATO and accuses the alliance of destabilizing Europe.
While French President Emmanuel Macron has questioned the U.S. commitment to NATO because of Trump's unrelenting criticism of allies, the U.S. president has also confounded Europeans by strengthening America's military presence in Europe.
Seventy years since its Cold War-era founding as an alliance focused on Moscow, Russia's efforts to undermine Western democracies through cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and covert operations have given NATO a renewed sense of purpose.
The U.S. military has also put countering China and Russia at the center of national defense strategy, shifting priorities after focusing on the fight against Islamist militants.
""We're going into an era of strategic competition in peacetime,"" Seguin said. ""The alliance has reorientated."""

PARIS (Reuters) - Most days, Yannick Stec drives a Paris metro train through tunnels beneath the Arc de Triomphe, but on Tuesday he was on strike and marching above ground to protect France's public services from a government he said is bent on undermining them.
Stec, a 37-year-old whose father, great-uncle, wife and sister-in-law have all been Paris public transport employees, joined thousands of strikers protesting against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reforms.
A day earlier, in the apartment in a public housing project he shares with his wife and three young children, he said the public service his family served for generations was being wrecked by a relentless drive to cut costs.
""When will it stop? Because it's never enough,"" he said, sitting on a sofa next to a bouncy chair usually occupied by his four-week-old baby son.
""There is this liberal tendency to provide gifts to the richest, while the middle classes and working classes have nothing.""
Stec joined RATP, the state enterprise that runs Paris buses, metros and suburban train lines, in 2000 at the age of 18 and trained to be a maintenance mechanic.
Six years into his career, he had an accident at work and lost part of his right foot. After recovering, he retrained as a train driver.
Last month, according to his pay-slip, he earned 2,249 euros, an amount which was boosted by working weekends and nights.
The company pension scheme - one of dozens that Macron wants to merge into a single, uniform system - allows him to retire with a full pension aged 55, seven years before the standard retirement age.
Macron says French people overall will be no worse off, and the reform will make pensions fairer. But Stec does not believe that. ""They'll make us work more to earn less,"" he said.
He described how his job had changed since his father's time. He said that, as the company tried to cut losses and hit performance targets, jobs were reduced.
Yet passenger numbers were up, drivers were under pressure to keep the trains moving fast and they also had to deal with problems like suspect packages.
""You have to watch the doors, the clock, keep driving well, speak nicely even when you're annoyed,"" he said. ""That takes a lot of effort.""
On Tuesday, dressed in a red jacket with the name of his CGT trade union on it, and carrying a red flag, he joined up with dozens of RATP colleagues near the Invalides museum complex, in central Paris.
With him in the column of protesters that set off through Paris was his sister-in-law Sonia Latouz, who has worked at RATP since she was 19.
""In the family, we're all very much involved in this fight,"" she said."

The trial against Mussa and his supporters began in 2016 following an investigation into suspected sympathizers of Islamic State in southern Bulgaria.
Mussa, already serving four years in jail for spreading radical Islam, was sentenced by the regional court in the southern city of Pazardzhik to 8-and-1/2 years.
His supporters, men from the southern towns of Plovdiv, Pazardzhik and Asenovgrad, received jail sentences of between one and 3-and-1/2 years. The only woman in the group got a suspended sentence.
In late 2014, following raids in more than 40 homes and a mosque in southern Bulgaria, investigators discovered a large number of shirts, hats, flags and banners with the logo of the Islamic State.
Prosecutors have said that Mussa, a former Christian of Roma origin who converted to Islam in 2000 while working in Vienna, had preached surrounded by the Islamic State flags. His group had attempted to recruit fighters for the militant group which had at the time seized parts of Syria and Iraq.
Bulgaria supported the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State but has not taken an active military role.
Muslims make up about 12 percent of Bulgaria's 7 million population and most belong to a centuries-old community, largely ethnic Turks."

OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (Reuters) - A 42-year-old gunman killed six people on Tuesday at a hospital waiting room in the eastern Czech city of Ostrava before fleeing and fatally shooting himself in the head, police said.
It was the worst shooting in the Czech Republic, where gun crime is relatively rare, since a man shot eight people dead and then killed himself at a restaurant in Uhersky Brod in 2015. 
It was unclear what motivated the shooting, which happened in the early morning at the outpatient clinic of the University Hospital in Ostrava, a city of 290,000 people 350 km (217 miles) east of the capital Prague and near the border with Poland. 
Prime Minister Andrej Babis told reporters it was an ""individual act"". 
""He came home and announced he had shot people, and that he is going to shoot himself,"" Babis told a televised news conference. He said the attacker's mother was cooperating with police.
The shooter fled the hospital after the attack, prompting a manhunt involving hundreds of officers. He later shot himself in the head at his car with a police helicopter flying overhead. 
He died about half an hour later after failed efforts to resuscitate him, Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said.
The shooter was identified as Ctirad Vitasek, a construction technician at the AZ-INTERGRIPS company based in Opava, just north-east of Ostrava, by the firm's Chairman Ales Zygula. 
CRIMINAL RECORD
Zygula told Reuters Vitasek had been on medical leave for the past month and a half. He also told Czech Radio that Vitasek was convinced he was seriously ill and that no one wanted to cure him.
Police said they received calls at 7:19 a.m. (0619 GMT) and officers were on the scene five minutes later. 
Hospital director Jiri Havrlant told reporters five people died in the attack and one died in surgery. Another two were seriously injured but no medics were hurt, he said.
The victims, all adults, had been shot at close range, he said. Police said they were four men and two women, amending earlier information that five of the victims were men.
The head of the regional police department, Tomas Kuzel, said the attacker, who did not have a gun license, was silent as he carried out the shooting with a 9-millimetre Czech handgun. 
The suspect had a criminal record including instances of violence and theft, he said.

Police dispatched two helicopters to hunt him. ""When the helicopter was over the car, the perpetrator shot himself in the head,"" Kuzel said. ""He died from self-inflicted wounds.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's Air Force on Tuesday said one of its cargo planes had crashed with 38 people on board after going missing in an isolated area between South America and the Antarctic, with the chance of finding survivors looking ""difficult"".
The Hercules C-130 aircraft took off at 4:55 p.m. (1955 GMT) on Monday from the southern city of Punta Arenas in Chilean Patagonia and was heading to a base in Antarctica. But controllers lost contact with the plane shortly after 6:00 p.m. 
The Air Force said in a statement it had yet to locate the plane but had concluded the plane must have crashed, given the number of hours it had been missing. The defense minister added that hope for finding survivors was fading. 
""The chances are difficult but I think it would be profoundly wrong to lose heart at this moment when we are doing everything humanly possible and with all our the energy and determination,"" Alberto Espina told reporters.
""The Air Force has provided a thorough investigation to clarify the facts with complete transparency.""
The plane was carrying 17 crew members and 21 passengers, the Air Force said. Its rescue team was scouring the area ""where it lost communication with the plane, with the goal of rescuing possible survivors.""
The crash comes at a turbulent time for Chile and President Sebastian Pinera, who has been grappling with rising discontent that has sparked almost two months of riots in the capital city, Santiago, and heaped pressure on his government.
""My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the 38 crew members and passengers of the FACh (Air Force) C-130 plane,"" Pinera wrote on Twitter, where he said his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, had offered support.
Argentina's government also said it had offered air and naval assistance for the search and rescue.
""With the help of many we are making every effort humanly possible in the search operation for the plane,"" Pinera said. He added that he had canceled a trip to Argentina to attend Tuesday's inauguration of incoming President Alberto Fernandez.
The region where the plane disappeared is a vast, largely untouched ocean wilderness of penguin-inhabited ice sheets off the edge of the South American continent. 

Those aboard the plane were to perform logistical support tasks for the maintenance of Chilean facilities at the Antarctic base, the Air Force said.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Qatar's premier attended an annual Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, its highest representation since 2017, but there was no public mention of a 2-1/2 year boycott by its neighbors despite hints of a thaw.
Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser Al Thani's presence follows an intensification of efforts to resolve the row among U.S. allies which shattered the GCC alliance amid growing Iran tensions.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and non-GCC member Egypt cut diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017 over allegations that it backs terrorism. Doha denies that and accuses them of trying to curtail its sovereignty.
Kuwait and the United States have tried to mediate the rift which undermined Washington’s efforts to form a united front against Iran, which is locked in a struggle for regional supremacy with Saudi Arabia.
A senior regional official told Reuters that Kuwait recently was working ""extremely hard to come up with reconciliation... supported by the United States"".
Efforts to end the row, including unannounced Qatari-Saudi talks in October, appeared to intensify after attacks in September on Saudi oil plants that initially halved the kingdom's output and pushed the region toward war.
Riyadh and Washington blame Iran for the assault along with earlier strikes this year on tankers in Gulf waters. Tehran denies involvement.
Saudi King Salman, who afforded the Qatari prime minister a traditional welcome on Tuesday, called for regional unity to confront Iran and secure energy supplies and maritime channels.
20-MINUTE MEETING
A closed-door meeting lasted barely 20 minutes before a final communique echoed the need to boost military and security cooperation and pledged to create a financial and monetary bloc by 2025.
After it was read out, Kuwait's ruling emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who has long pressed to resolve the Qatar dispute, commended the call for unity.
Addressing King Salman, he said: ""God willing, the coming meetings will be better than past meetings.""
Asked about mediation efforts, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said they were ongoing but better conducted away from the spotlight.
Two sources familiar with Saudi thinking said Riyadh has softened its stance on a list of 13 demands to lift the embargo, including that Doha cut links to the Muslim Brotherhood, close Al Jazeera TV, shutter a Turkish military base and reduce ties with Iran, with whom Qatar shares a giant gas field.
But little is known about the current state of negotiations, and the UAE and Egypt may still refuse to yield. Qatar's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and Turkey remain contentious.
""The onus lies with the one that caused the crisis, to reconsider erroneous policies that led to its isolation,"" senior Emirati official Anwar Gargash tweeted on Monday.
Gerald Feierstein of the Washington-based Middle East Center said the dispute was not expected to reach a definitive conclusion anytime soon, despite signs that the parties are inching towards reconciliation.
The Qatari premier last visited Saudi Arabia in May for an emergency security summit.
Asked about Lebanon, Prince Faisal said the Mediterranean state's stability was important to Saudi Arabia.
Faisal said he would not ""pre-judge"" Riyadh's actions at an international conference in France on Wednesday called to support Lebanon as it grapples with a political impasse and the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.

Criminal justice was thrust to the center of the campaign after Usman Khan, who had been released early from prison, killed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23 - both active in a program on prisoner rehabilitation.
Johnson vowed to invest more in the prison system and toughen sentences, blaming the opposition Labour Party for a law passed more than a decade ago that provided for some prisoners to be released early automatically.
""What was required was just a dignified approach, whereby the politicians would express their regrets, express their condolences ... and would then get on with campaigning in the election,"" Dave Merritt said in an interview with Sky News.
""Instead of seeing a tragedy, Boris Johnson saw an opportunity and he went on the offensive. He saw an opportunity to score some points in the election and he immediately said this is Labour's fault, they allowed this to happen.""
Merritt said his son, who had known Khan, was passionate about helping people to redeem themselves and would have been ""extremely upset"" at the way his death was being used.
A spokesman for Johnson said the prime minister had ""expressed his deepest condolences to Mr Merritt for his tragic loss – an experience no family should have to go through.""
""The prime minister’s view remains it is 'extraordinary and wrong' that Khan had been released halfway through his prison sentence and has long argued that sentencing should be tougher for violent and extremist offenders,"" the spokesman added.
Merritt said he had not had any contact from Johnson or his office, and that the family had declined an offer, made through the police, to meet interior minister Priti Patel to express her condolences.
Asked whether he himself was politicizing the event, Merritt said he would not have spoken up if the attack had not been used in a political way.
""If anybody has a right to say something about this situation then it is me and his family: we have lost Jack, Jack can’t speak for himself anymore,"" he said.
""The fact that it was used in such a political way ... it was important that somebody said something and that just happened to be me."""
742,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>",Algeria set for presidential election denounced by protesters as charade,"By Lamine Chikhi
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria holds a presidential election on Thursday which protesters say offers no real choice and will keep in power the ruling hierarchy they have been trying to oust in 10 months of demonstrations. 
Student demonstrators again surged through Algiers on Tuesday, chanting ""We will not vote"" and ""we want freedom"", and two former prime ministers and other senior figures were jailed for corruption in an apparent effort to mollify protesters.
Although the election is unlikely to bring political change, it could become a pivotal moment in the struggle between the protesters and the army, testing the patience of both sides in Africa's biggest country, an important gas supplier to Europe.
The protesters forced out veteran President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April, but view their uprising that began in February as only half-complete. They want the old guard to quit power entirely and the military to abandon politics.
With no sign of the protesters backing down and the military trying to use the election to restore order, the political system is paralyzed at a time when urgent action is needed to revive the economy, hit by a fall in vital oil revenues.
""We will see if a bad election is better than no election,"" said political analyst Farid Ferrahi.
The five presidential candidates, approved by the state, are former prime ministers Abdelmadjid Tebboune and Ali Benflis, ex-culture minister Azzedddine Mihoubi, former tourism minister Abdelkader Bengrine, and Abdelaziz Belaid, a party leader.
All are familiar faces regarded by the protesters as part of the old guard that has held power since Algeria won independence from France in 1962. 
The protesters believe the army will continue to wield power behind the scenes after consolidating its position in the hierarchy by purging once untouchable rivals. 
Its chief of staff, Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah, is now Algeria's most powerful figure and sees the election of a new president as the best way to draw a line under a year of tumult and refresh the enduring political order. 
""POWER""
The army has long been a core component of the ""pouvoir"" - or power - ruling the North African country of more than 40 million but previously had to reckon with other powerful bodies including an internal security department. 
As protests gathered momentum, Gaed Salah went on television to urge Bouteflika to step down and many of the old president's former allies were detained on corruption charges. 
On Tuesday, former prime ministers Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal were among several people jailed on corruption charges which they denied. 
Gaed Salah's old rivals in the security department have also been detained in a deep cleansing of the ruling structure by the army, settling an internal power struggle. 
""Bouteflika's corrupt elite is in prison. The bad news is that there is no alternative elite,"" a retired government minister said. ""The system will not change, but it will adapt to changes as it has always done."" 
Scores of demonstrators have been arrested. Opposition figures, journalists and even a satirical cartoonist have also been held for ""undermining army morale"", and human rights groups have warned of a growing crackdown on the protesters. 
Any shift after the election toward a more violent settlement of the political struggle could be disastrous.
Nobody wants a return to the 1990s civil war that killed 200,000 people but the authorities' ability to appease public opinion with gestures such as pay rises and free loans - as during the 2011 Arab Spring - may be limited now.

Algeria gets 95% of its foreign revenue from oil and gas sales, which since a slide in energy prices in 2014 have halved to $30 billion a year.

VUCJAK, Bosnia (Reuters) - Bosnian authorities, bowing to international pressure, begun moving migrants on Tuesday from a freezing makeshift camp in a forest to more appropriate shelter.
Around 600 migrants have been battling to survive the harsh Bosnian winter in the Vucjak camp, a former landfill area near the northwestern Bosnian town of Bihac and just 8km (5 miles) from the Croatian border.
Aid agencies have long urged authorities to close the camp, which lacks running water and electricity. The forest is strewn with landmines left over from the wars of the 1990s.
Following a visit last week by a senior European human rights envoy who urged authorities to close the camp immediately, Bosnia decided to move the migrants from Vucjak to facilities near the capital Sarajevo.
Under heavy police protection, seven buses took migrants and refugees to their new location. Access to the camp was restricted for media and allowed only to Red Cross officials.
Nermina Cemalovic, the Bihac region's health and labor minister, said no incidents occurred and that the Vucjak camp will be completely dismantled on Tuesday.
""We expect that all migrants from Vucjak will be moved today and the camp finally closed, but activities are still going on,"" Bihac police spokesman Ale Siljdedic said.
However, some people who made long journeys from Asia and the Middle East to reach the European Union have said they do not want to be rehoused further away from the Croatian border.
A Reuters photographer saw a few dozen migrants leaving the camp on their own in the early hours of Tuesday.
Bosnia is struggling to deal with an upsurge in migrant numbers since Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia closed their borders against undocumented immigration. The migrants hope to get to wealthy western Europe and find work.
More than 50,000 migrants have entered Bosnia since 2018 and many make it to Western Europe. There are still about 8,000 in Bosnia, most in the Bihac area, and they are hoping to get into the EU.
Many sleep in the streets and abandoned houses in the cities of Sarajevo and Tuzla, helped by volunteers, because Bosnia's temporary migrant camps are so cramped.

744,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Special Report: White House veterans helped Gulf monarchy build secret surveillance unit,"By Joel Schectman and Christopher Bing
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the years after 9/11, former U.S. counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke warned Congress that the country needed more expansive spying powers to prevent another catastrophe. Five years after leaving government, he shopped the same idea to an enthusiastic partner: an Arab monarchy with deep pockets.
In 2008, Clarke went to work as a consultant guiding the United Arab Emirates as it created a cyber surveillance capability that would utilize top American intelligence contractors to help monitor threats against the tiny nation.
The secret unit Clarke helped create had an ominous acronym: DREAD, short for Development Research Exploitation and Analysis Department. In the years that followed, the UAE unit expanded its hunt far beyond suspected extremists to include a Saudi women’s rights activist, diplomats at the United Nations and personnel at FIFA, the world soccer body. By 2012, the program would be known among its American operatives by a codename: Project Raven.
Reuters reports this year revealed how a group of former National Security Agency operatives and other elite American intelligence veterans helped the UAE spy on a wide range of targets through the previously undisclosed program — from terrorists to human rights activists, journalists and dissidents.
Now, an examination of the origins of DREAD, reported here for the first time, shows how a pair of former senior White House leaders, working with ex-NSA spies and Beltway contractors, played pivotal roles in building a program whose actions are now under scrutiny by federal authorities.
To chart the UAE spying mission’s evolution, Reuters examined more than 10,000 DREAD program documents and interviewed more than a dozen contractors, intelligence operatives and former government insiders with direct knowledge of the program. The documents Reuters reviewed span nearly a decade of the DREAD program, starting in 2008, and include internal memos describing the project’s logistics, operational plans and targets.
Clarke was the first in a string of former White House and U.S. defense executives who arrived in the UAE after 9/11 to build the spying unit. Utilizing his close relationship to the country’s rulers, forged through decades of experience as a senior U.S. decision-maker, Clarke won numerous security consulting contracts in the UAE. One of them was to help build the secret spying unit in an unused airport facility in Abu Dhabi.
In an interview in Washington, Clarke said that after recommending that the UAE create a cyber surveillance agency, his company, Good Harbor Consulting, was hired to help the country build it. The idea, Clarke said, was to create a unit capable of tracking terrorists. He said the plan was approved by the U.S. State Department and the National Security Agency, and that Good Harbor followed U.S. law.
“The incentive was to help in the fight against Al Qaeda. The UAE is a very good counterterrorism partner. You need to remember the timing back then, post 9-11,” Clarke said. “The NSA wanted it to happen.”
The NSA did not answer written questions about its knowledge of DREAD or its relationship to any of the contractors. The State Department said it carefully vets foreign defense service agreements for human rights issues. UAE spokespeople at its Washington embassy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment.
Clarke’s work in creating DREAD launched a decade of deepening involvement in the UAE hacking unit by Beltway insiders and U.S. intelligence veterans. The Americans helped the UAE broaden the mission from a narrow focus on active extremist threats to a vast surveillance operation targeting thousands of people around the world perceived as foes by the Emirati government.
One of Clarke’s former Good Harbor partners, Paul Kurtz, said Reuters’ earlier reports showed that the program expanded into dangerous terrain and that the proliferation of cyber skills merits greater U.S. oversight. “I have felt revulsion reading what ultimately happened,” said Kurtz, a former senior director for national security at the White House.
At least five former White House veterans worked for Clarke in the UAE, either on DREAD or other projects. Clarke’s Good Harbor ceded control of DREAD in 2010 to other American contractors, just as the operation began successfully hacking targets.
A succession of U.S. contractors helped keep DREAD’s contingent of Americans on the UAE’s payroll, an engagement that was permitted through secret State Department agreements, Reuters found.
The program’s evolution illustrates how Washington’s contractor culture benefits from a system of legal and regulatory loopholes that allows ex-spies and government insiders to transfer their skills to foreign countries, even ones reputed to have poor human rights track records.
American operatives for DREAD were able to sidestep the few guardrails against foreign espionage work that existed, including restrictions on the hacking of U.S. computer systems.
Despite prohibitions against targeting U.S. servers, for instance, by 2012 DREAD operatives had targeted Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Hotmail and Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) email accounts. Eventually, the expanding surveillance dragnet even swept up other American citizens, as Reuters reported earlier this year.
In an interview, Mike Rogers, former chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, said he has watched with growing concern as more and more former American intelligence officials cash in by working for foreign countries.
“These skill sets do not belong to you,” he said of ex-U.S. agents, but to the U.S. government that trained them. Just as Washington wouldn’t let its spies work in the pay of foreign nations while employed at the NSA, he said, “Why on God’s green earth would we encourage you to do that after you leave the government?”
An NSA spokesman said former employees are mandated for life not to reveal classified information.
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE GULF
For years before the creation of DREAD, Clarke grappled with the need for domestic surveillance in the United States, as well as its potential dangers.
Clarke, a counterterrorism czar to Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, is perhaps best known for offering an unequivocal public apology for Washington’s inability to prevent the 9/11 attacks.
“Your government failed you. Those entrusted with protecting you failed you. And I failed you,” Clarke said in 2004, one year after leaving government, testifying before a U.S. commission established to investigate intelligence failures leading to the 9/11 attacks.
To prevent future attacks, Clarke urged America to create a domestic spying service, while saying such a unit must avoid civil liberties violations. “We’d have to explain to the American people in a very compelling way why they needed a domestic intelligence service, because I think most Americans would be fearful of a secret police,” he said.
Clarke’s testimony to the 9/11 Commission helped lead to the creation in 2005 of a domestic intelligence service within the Federal Bureau of Investigation — described as “a service within a service” — staffed by federal agents, language analysts and surveillance specialists.
Two years earlier, Clarke had joined his former deputy Roger Cressey at the newly launched Good Harbor Consulting, a security advisory group. Clarke brought one of the most famous names in U.S. national security.
He also brought a decades-long relationship with a potential client of immense wealth: Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, known as MbZ, the son of the UAE’s most powerful ruler. In the months preceding the 1991 U.S.-led war on Iraq, Clarke, then a senior American diplomat, had been sent to the Gulf to seek assistance from regional allies. MbZ stepped up as the U.S. prepared to go to war.
MbZ helped Clarke obtain permission from the Emirati government for bombing runs in UAE airspace, and he funneled billions toward the American war effort. In 1991, when Congress questioned whether Washington should allow a $682 million arms sale to UAE, Clarke bristled.
“They transferred $4 billion to the U.S. Treasury to support the war effort,” he told the House Subcommittee On Arms Control. “Is that the kind of nation that we should snub by denying them 20 attack helicopters? I don't think so.” The UAE got the choppers.
In the years after Clarke joined Good Harbor in 2003, MbZ, the de facto ruler of the UAE, granted the company the rare opportunity to help build the country’s homeland security strategy from the ground up. Clarke’s Good Harbor soon won a series of security contracts to help the UAE secure its infrastructure, including work to protect the Gulf state’s seaports, nuclear projects, airports, embassies and petrochemical facilities, according to two people with direct knowledge of the contracts.
Along with helping stand up an emergency response department and maritime security unit, Clarke believed the UAE required an NSA-like agency with the ability to spy on terrorists. Clarke said he placed Good Harbor partner Paul Kurtz, himself a former White House veteran, in charge of the contract.
“At the highest level, it was cyber defense and how you protect your own networks,” Kurtz said in a phone interview with Reuters. The UAE wanted to know, he said, “How do I understand more about what terrorists may be doing?” 
Asked whether he was concerned the UAE could use the capability to crack down on activists or dissidents, Clarke stressed that “the overarching concern was getting Al Qaeda.” He said he had limited visibility into the program at the time and that Kurtz was responsible for the day-to-day management of the contract to build the program.
Kurtz said his personal involvement was limited to high level consulting, with his knowledge of daily activities “next to none.” For technical expertise on hacking, he said, Good Harbor relied on subcontractors from the American defense company SRA International, managed by an executive named Karl Gumtow.
SRA, then a 7,000-employee operation based in Fairfax, Virginia, was chosen because of its experience with NSA contracts, Clarke said.
MISSION LAUNCHED
Utilizing eight contractors from SRA, Good Harbor started building DREAD in 2008 inside a building that resembled a small airplane hangar on the edge of the Al Bateen airport in Abu Dhabi. The program began as an arm of MbZ’s royal court, and was initially managed by the prince’s son, Khalid.
The contractors built the project from scratch. They trained potential Emirati staff in hacking techniques and created covert computer networks and anonymous Internet accounts the UAE could use for surveillance operations.
In 2009, the group set out to build a spy tool codenamed “the Thread,” software that would enable the Emiratis to steal files from Windows computers and transmit them to servers controlled by the Court of the Crown Prince, DREAD program documents show.
Beyond offering guidance and support, Good Harbor and SRA did not envision an active role in hacking operations.
The program was intended to leave the UAE equipped with the cyber capabilities to pursue terrorism threats on its own. But within months, the Americans could see they needed to take the lead from their less experienced Emirati colleagues, said three former DREAD operatives.
Some UAE trainees appeared disinterested and ill-equipped. One trainer, a former SRA contractor and ex-NSA cryptographer named Keith Tuttle, concluded one student had “lost interest” and another “continues to struggle with technology,” a program report card reviewed by Reuters shows.
That left the Americans with little choice but to get more involved, two former DREAD operatives told Reuters, eventually doing everything aside from hitting the final button on a computer intrusion. Tuttle, citing advice from his attorneys, declined to comment.
A spokesman for General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), the owner of SRA International after multiple business acquisitions, said the original contract with Good Harbor ended in 2010. He declined further comment.
The hacking requests from UAE security forces to the new unit accelerated after Christmas 2009, just one year after Good Harbor started on DREAD. UAE leaders received intelligence warnings that a violent extremist attack could be imminent. A panicked request came to the nascent hacker team: Help us spy on outbound Internet traffic coming from a suspected extremist’s home computer network located in the northern part of the country.
DREAD’s SRA handlers were still months from finishing the Windows hacking software, Thread. Suddenly, U.S. operatives were cobbling together makeshift spy tools based on computer security testing software found for free online, according to two people with direct knowledge of the incident.
Yet they succeeded within weeks, hacking the suspected extremist in a mission seen by the Emiratis as a key success that may have prevented an attack. The incident marked a crucial moment in the relationship. With that success came more targeting requests and a deeper role for the Americans, said two people with direct knowledge.
By the end of 2010, Good Harbor stepped back from DREAD, leaving control in the hands of SRA vice president Gumtow, program documents show. He had just started his own Maryland company, CyberPoint. “Our focus was to help them defend their country,” Gumtow said in a phone interview.
With Good Harbor’s departure, Kurtz joined CyberPoint, although he said his involvement in DREAD ended by 2011.
40 AMERICANS AND $34 MILLION
Within two years, Gumtow expanded the number of Americans on the program from around a dozen to as many as 40. More than a dozen were poached from the halls of the NSA or its contractor list. DREAD’s annual budget reached an estimated $34 million, project documents show.
Some American recruits had concerns about working for a foreign spy service. But the program’s connection to respected national security figures such as Clarke, Kurtz and Gumtow led them to conclude the effort was above board, four former operatives said.
Jonathan Cole, a former U.S. intelligence operative who joined DREAD in 2014, said he believed the UAE mission had Washington’s blessing due to the involvement of CyberPoint’s Maryland-based staff in other classified programs for the U.S. government. “I made some assumptions,” Cole said.
In 2011, the program moved to the first of a series of secret converted mansions, known as the Villa, and among its American contractors was given the codename Project Raven.
Gumtow told Reuters his U.S. contractors were hired only to train Emirati hackers, and were prohibited from assisting in operations themselves. U.S. law generally prohibits Americans from hacking computer systems anywhere, but specifically prohibits targeting of other American people, companies or servers.
Although Gumtow managed the DREAD contract for five years from Baltimore, he said he never learned of such activities occurring among his staff. He said his visibility was limited, as he visited his UAE staff five or six times a year.
“I did not get involved in day-to-day program activities,” Gumtow said. “If we had a rogue person, then there’s nothing I can do.”
Still, the American team soon occupied almost every key position in the program. American operatives helped locate target accounts, discover their vulnerabilities and cue up cyberattacks. To stay within the bounds of the law, the Americans did not press the button on the ultimate attack, but would often literally stand over the shoulders of the Emiratis who did, 10 former operatives told Reuters.
After the 2011 Arab Spring demonstrations shook the region, Emirati security experts feared their country was next. DREAD’s targets began to shift from counterterrorism to a separate category the UAE termed “national security targets” — assisting in a broad crackdown against dissidents and others seen as a political threat. The operations came to include the previously unreported hacks of a German human rights group, the United Nations’ offices in New York and FIFA executives.
Between 2012 and 2015, individual teams were tasked with hacking into entire rival governments, as the program’s focus shifted from counterterrorism to espionage against geopolitical foes, documents show.
One target was UAE archrival Qatar, which in 2010 gained global attention by winning the right to hold soccer’s 2022 World Cup. In 2014, DREAD operatives targeted directors at FIFA, the Swiss-based body that runs international soccer, and people involved in Qatar’s World Cup organizing body.
The ploy was designed to steal damaging information about Qatar’s World Cup bid, which could be leaked to embarrass the UAE’s Gulf rival. Allegations that FIFA officials were bribed by Qatar in exchange for granting its World Cup bid surfaced in media reports in 2014.
The FIFA hacking operation, codenamed Brutal Challenge, was planned by an ex-NSA analyst named Chris Smith, according to DREAD operation planning memos reviewed by Reuters. The hackers sent boobytrapped Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) messages and emails containing a malicious link to a website called “worldcupgirls.” Clicking on the link deployed spyware into the target’s computer.
It is not clear whether the mission succeeded. But the targets included Hassan Al Thawadi, secretary general of Qatar’s FIFA organizing body, and Jack Warner, a former FIFA executive who the U.S. later indicted on money laundering charges.
Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, a governmental body in charge of helping organize the 2022 footballing tournament, had no comment. A spokesman for Qatar’s government said the country saw its successful bid to host the World Cup as “a chance for the world to see our region in a new light.”
In a statement, a spokeswoman said FIFA was “not aware” of any hacking incidents related to Qatar’s World Cup bid. A second spokesperson said a FIFA internal investigation did not find that Qatar paid bribes to win the right to host the tournament.
Warner, who is facing extradition to the United States from Trinidad and Tobago, could not be reached for comment. He has repeatedly proclaimed he is innocent of the charges. Smith did not respond to messages sent through email and social media.
FOREIGN LICENSE, SCANT OVERSIGHT
To conduct its UAE business, CyberPoint obtained a State Department foreign defense services license in 2010 and 2014.
The agreements, reviewed by Reuters, are written in broad language. Hacking operations are described as “collecting information from communications systems inside and outside the UAE.” The agreements placed no restrictions against targeting human rights activists, journalists or U.S. allies.
A State Department spokesman said that before granting such a license, the agency carefully weighs human rights concerns. The authorization doesn’t grant the right to violate human rights, he said. But he declined to comment on the agreements between the agency and CyberPoint.
The DREAD agreements did prohibit the program from assisting in hacking operations against Americans or American-owned email servers. Doing so “could subject you to criminal liability under U.S. law, even if the activities were conducted overseas,” warned a CyberPoint legal counsel in a 2011 memo.
This restriction was often sidestepped, project documents show. CyberPoint employees assisted in the hacking of hundreds of Google, Yahoo, Hotmail and Facebook accounts, sharing screenshots from the intrusions in presentations with senior Emirati intelligence officers. For example, DREAD accessed Google and Yahoo accounts to steal its targets’ Internet browser history, with the hackers highlighting their porn preferences in reports to managers, documents show.
In 2012, the program targeted the Hotmail and Gmail accounts of five staffers of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a German pro-democracy group that at the time was pushing for greater press and speech freedoms in the UAE. DREAD intercepted messages from one foundation manager’s hacked Gmail account. “Assume all comm channels have been” compromised, the manager’s message to an employee read.
Behind the scenes, the German ambassador to the UAE was called to meet with officials from the Emirates’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who said the German non-profit must leave the country, said a person with direct knowledge. In March 2012, the group was ordered out. The foundation declined comment.
American operatives also helped target the Gmail and Facebook accounts of Ahmed Ghaith al-Suwaidi, an Emirati economist and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2011. In January 2012, DREAD hackers reported Al-Suwaidi had emailed signed documents putting his wife in charge of his assets in case anything happened to him, DREAD operation documents show.
Two months later, al-Suwaidi was arrested and detained in a secret prison, where he said he was tortured and forced to sign a confession, said Amnesty International. In 2013, as part of a trial of 94 activists accused of fomenting a coup, he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Mohamed Al Zaabi, a friend and fellow activist, said al-Suwaidi had never advocated for a coup and had simply pushed for political reform.
Gumtow said that, to the best of his knowledge, CyberPoint was careful to stay within the bounds of the license and U.S. law.
‘SLIPPERY SLOPE’
Over time, conflict emerged between the Emiratis and Americans over the selection of targets, which Americans believed sometimes crossed the line into hacking U.S.-related entities. The locals began restricting the Americans’ access to surveillance databases, marking some “For Emirati Eyes Only.” Near the end of 2015, the UAE canceled its CyberPoint contract and hired a UAE cybersecurity firm, DarkMatter.
Gumtow warned his employees that if they remained in the program, they would no longer be authorized under the State Department agreement and would be essentially going rogue. More than a dozen stayed.
While DarkMatter took over DREAD, the program was a tightly held secret, with even some company executives unaware of its existence, said six people with direct knowledge of the matter.
Under DarkMatter, DREAD targeted the United Nations’ offices in New York in a bid to compromise the email accounts of foreign diplomats from countries seen as UAE rivals, said a former operative. A UN spokesman confirmed the organization’s cybersecurity team identified attacks from a hacking group associated with the UAE.
In some cases, DREAD’s surveillance operations preceded the torture of targets.
In 2017, operatives hacked the emails of Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, after she tried to defy a ban against women driving in Saudi Arabia, a former DREAD operative said. Three years earlier, al-Hathloul, who was studying in the UAE, had been arrested by the Saudis after trying to drive across the border into Saudi Arabia and jailed for 73 days.
DREAD operatives monitoring al-Hathloul gave her the codename Purple Sword.
In 2018, just weeks before a royal decree allowed Saudi women to drive legally for the first time, UAE security forces arrested al-Hathloul again in Abu Dhabi and placed her in a private jet back to her home country. Once there, Saudi security forces jailed her on charges of sedition, torturing her in a secret facility outside Jeddah, where she remains, her brother Walid al-Hathloul told Reuters.
“It’s very disappointing to see Americans taking advantage of skills they learned in the U.S. to help this regime,” he said. “They are basically like mercenaries.”
Saudi Arabia and the UAE are close allies. A Saudi embassy spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
In a brief emailed statement, DarkMatter said it was unaware of Reuters’ findings or any improper actions by the company.
A federal grand jury in Washington has been investigating whether American staff violated U.S. hacking laws in the UAE mission. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department declined to comment.
Congress is also asking questions, citing the earlier Reuters reports while pressing the State Department to explain DREAD and pushing for more transparency in foreign license agreements. Foreign governments “have apparently exploited the advanced training and expertise of individuals who developed their technical skills while in U.S. national service,” members wrote in May to the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of State.
Rogers, the former House intelligence committee chairman, said it’s time for Washington to impose tougher restrictions on foreign intelligence contracting. “Outright eliminating those opportunities, I think, should absolutely be on the table,” he said.

Kurtz, who helped launch the program 10 years ago, agreed the U.S. government needs to reconsider how it controls the transfer of cyber capabilities overseas. “It can be a very slippery slope,” he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Yuri Luzhkov, who as Moscow mayor transformed the drab former capital of the Soviet Union into a glitzy playground for Russia's super-rich with help from his construction magnate wife, has died aged 83.
President Vladimir Putin sent his condolences to Luzhkov's family in a telegram, calling him an outsized personality whose tenure as mayor helped contribute to Russia's post-Soviet rebirth.
Putin singled out Luzhkov's work advocating for the Crimean city of Sevastopol to be regarded as a Russian city ""despite all the circumstances and diplomatic protocol."" Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
Luzhkov died in Munich, Russia's embassy in Berlin said in a statement. He had recently undergone heart surgery, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.
Luzhkov, who helped set up the now ruling United Russia party but later became a Kremlin critic, will be remembered by many Russians for his plain-talking folksy style and his love of flat leather caps and bee-keeping.
Some Muscovites reviled Luzhkov, casting him as a corrupt vandal who as Moscow mayor from 1992 until 2010 tore down many historic buildings to make way for what they described as tasteless modern replacements, some of them built by his wife's construction company.
Others say he breathed new vibrancy into Moscow during a difficult period when it was finding its feet after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and had some of the world's longest traffic jams and sporadic contract killings.
MODERN CITY
Luzhkov said in 2010 he had turned Moscow into a modern European city and was proud of his achievements. Others say Sergei Sobyanin, the current mayor, achieved that, spending big to oversee an overhaul of transport, roads and parks.
Luzhkov and his second wife, Elena Baturina, who controlled a huge construction company which played a role in Moscow's transformation, denied allegations of cronyism or corruption.
Luzhkov blamed some of the allegations, aired on state television before then President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in 2010, on his political foes.
Luzhkov's wife Baturina is worth an estimated $1.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and is Russia's richest woman. She spends time in London, where the couple sent their two daughters to study.
Luzhkov was first appointed mayor by then President Boris Yeltsin. The United Russia party he helped set up in 2001 has helped Putin keep power but, after falling out with Medvedev in 2010, Luzhkov became outspoken in his criticism of the Kremlin."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Roxana Gonzalez, a bookshop owner in Buenos Aires, has a plea for new Argentine President Alberto Fernandez, who takes over power on Tuesday amid the pressures of recession, heavy debt and inflation.
""What I want is to fix this disaster,"" Gonzalez said at her bookstore on a busy avenue in Buenos Aires, with a large sign reading ""liquidation"" hanging above the entrance.
Gonzalez, 46, has sharply felt the downturn, which saw Argentina slip into recession last year, closing four bookstores she owned with her husband. Now, she manages the one remaining store while her husband drives for U.S. ride sharing platform Uber (NYSE:UBER).
""These four years were an economic disaster for us,"" Gonzalez said, referring to outgoing President Mauricio Macri's term since the end of 2015 in which time the peso has plummeted against the dollar, growth has stalled and annual inflation has jumped to above 50%.
Fernandez, a center-left Peronist who ran with populist ex-leader Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, faces a tough challenge to revive the economy, with dwindling foreign reserves and looming debt repayments threatening to push Argentina into default.
His fledgling government will need to negotiate debt restructuring with creditors including the International Monetary Fund to avoid being shut out of global markets, while reviving domestic demand to help people like Gonzalez.
Not everyone is convinced, however, with many fearing that the Peronists - the top political power in Argentina's recent history - will usher in protectionist policies that could aggravate the situation further.
Fernandez de Kirchner, the incoming vice president, divides opinion sharply among voters and markets. She raised export taxes on the key farm sector and imposed tough capital controls during her twin terms from 2007-2015.
""For me, with Fernandez it will be the same as it was with Cristina,"" said Macri supporter Joana Paredes, 22, a mobile phone seller in the capital who fears a sharp shift to the left.
""I am worried about these next four years in Argentina and the situation around Latin America because there are problems in Bolivia and Chile,"" she said. ""You never know what can happen.""
For Gonzalez things can only get better.
""I don't care if Alberto and Cristina rule together or separately. That's their business and I'm not interested,"" she said, adding all she wanted was Fernandez to focus on reviving growth and fixing the economy.
In March next year, her rental contract for the last store is due to expire and Gonzalez said she does not know if they will be able to stay open. She hoped to hold on to the rest of the books to sell to a collector but says she needs the cash now.
""I have to liquidate because I need the money,"" she said."

Erected last month, the monument sees Russia's leader wearing a suit as he looks out over a barren landscape of rocky valleys and snow-capped peaks, 30 km (18.6 miles) south of the capital, Bishkek.
Resort director Akbar Roziev said he had turned to Kyrgyz banks looking for a credit line but did not find the terms on offer to his liking, whereas the Russian-Kyrgyz Development Fund, opened in 2014, extended him a loan at 4%.
""I didn't know how to express my gratitude,"" Roziev said, adding that he saw Putin as a role model. ""Thanks to his loan, we now have a (much better) center.""
""What else can I say? Putin is the man, with a capital M,"" Roziev said.
The fund supporting Roziev's project describes itself as the leading mechanism for integrating Kyrgyzstan into the Eurasian Union, a foreign policy initiative promoted by Putin since 2011 which aims to remove barriers to trade, capital and labor movement between Russia and its ex-Soviet neighbors.
The statue joins other monuments of leaders erected by the ski resort, including one of early Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin.
Tourists regularly pose for photos and take selfies with the resort's newest addition, Roziev said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Whoever leaked UK-U.S. trade papers online ahead of Britain's general election took extensive precautions to cover their tracks, which experts who suspect Russia was behind the effort say points to a professional and well-planned operation.
The heightened security measures, including a web of disposable email addresses and virtual phone numbers, are not typical of ordinary internet users and draw further parallels with a previous Russian information operation, said outside researchers and government officials.
British intelligence officials are now investigating whether the documents, which detail negotiations between Britain and the United States over a future trade deal, were part of a ""hack and leak"" operation ahead of a general election on Thursday.
Social media site Reddit said last week the documents were first posted online by accounts linked to a Russian campaign uncovered in June, fuelling concern that Moscow was seeking to interfere in the upcoming vote.
""This is very, very clinical operational security,"" said a person familiar with the government investigation. ""Whoever has done this is massively trying to hide their tracks, it is not exactly run-of-the-mill behavior.""
The opposition Labour Party has seized on the leaked documents to allege a plot by the governing Conservatives to sell off parts of the state-run National Health Service (NHS) in trade talks with the United States, a key issue in the British election campaign.
Labour said last week that the authenticity of the leaked documents has not been disputed and it acted in the public interest by releasing them to journalists. It declined to comment on Tuesday on new evidence about the source of the leak.
A government spokeswoman pointed to an earlier statement that officials were looking into the matter.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied allegations of election meddling and dismissed suspicions that Russian hackers may have stolen and leaked the documents.
A person with knowledge of the matter said the email address used to register multiple social media accounts which repeatedly shared web links to the leaked documents was also used to sign up for nine services offering virtual online phone numbers.
The Internet phone numbers could have been used to register more accounts, further obscuring the owner's identity, or to send SMS messages directing politicians and journalists to the leaked papers, the source said.
Reuters was not able to establish if any messages were sent or received from the accounts.
The same person or people also registered an email account and online blogging account from a platform providing so-called ""burner"" email addresses, which have public inboxes but are designed to be used once and then abandoned, web records show.
Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at social media analytics firm Graphika -- which worked with Reuters to first identify the suspected Russian activity -- said the ""attention to secrecy"" closely resembled a previous Russian campaign, whose operators also made significant efforts to hide their identities.
""This operation was run by professionals. The attention to security was far too tight and consistent to come from anyone else,"" he said.
""It's an operation that wanted to get its stories noticed, but really, really didn't want to be traced back to the source."""

OSLO (Reuters) - Militant groups and global military powers both pose a threat to peace and stability in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Tuesday after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for forging a peace accord with Eritrea.
Abiy won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize in October for his peacemaking efforts, which ended two decades of hostility with Ethiopia's longtime enemy Eritrea.
In a speech delivered at Oslo City Hall before dignitaries including Norway's King Harald V, Abiy praised the ""good will"" of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and described the two countries' commitment to peace as ""iron-clad"".
But Abiy, who at 43 is Africa's youngest political leader, also spoke of the dangers facing his region.
""The global military superpowers are expanding their military presence in the area. Terrorist and extremist groups also seek to establish a foothold,"" Abiy said, without specifying which countries or groups he had in mind.
""We do not want the Horn to be a battleground for superpowers nor a hideout for the merchants of terror and brokers of despair and misery,"" he added. 
As a soldier during the 1998-2000 war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, Abiy said he had witnessed the ""ugliness of battle, its cruelty and what it can do to people"". 
""War is the epitome of hell for all involved. I know because I have been there and back,"" he said. 
""I have seen brothers slaughtering brothers on the battlefield. I have seen older men, women, and children trembling in terror under the deadly shower of bullets and artillery shells."" 
ETHNIC TENSIONS
Since taking power in 2018, Abiy has implemented sweeping political reforms that won him praise but also lifted the lid on long-repressed tensions between Ethiopia's many ethnic groups. 
""We have laid the groundwork for genuine multi-party democracy, and we will soon hold a free and fair election,"" he said. Elections are scheduled for May 2020. 
Abiy said his administration had released all political prisoners, shut detention facilities and stopped jailing journalists.
Critics of Abiy say his attempts to impose unity - including forming a single national political party - are doomed, given that Ethiopia's 105 million citizens belong to more than 80 ethnic groups.
Eighty six people were killed during protests in October against the treatment of a prominent activist, while 409 people were detained over the unrest.
Last year, ethnic violence forced more than two million people from their homes and killed hundreds, the United Nations and monitoring groups say.

Bashir, who ruled Sudan until the military removed him in April following months of street protests, was charged in May with incitement and involvement in the killing of protesters.
He is also already on trial on charges of possessing illicit foreign currency and corruption. A verdict is expected on Saturday in that trial.
""We believe that this is a political trial par excellence because 30 years have passed and many variables have occurred,"" Mohamed al-Hassan al-Amin, a member of Bashir's defense, told reporters of his summons on Tuesday.
""We do not know what happened in the investigation room. We have an agreement with President al-Bashir not to speak with this committee and to boycott it,"" Amin added, referring to the investigative committee.
The ousted president's prosecution is a test of how far power-sharing military and civilian authorities will tackle the legacy of his 30-year authoritarian rule.

""(They should) form a government quickly because any delay will continue to worsen the situation,"" Le Drian told a news conference.
Six weeks since Saad al-Hariri resigned as prime minister, prompted by protests against the ruling elite, the financial crisis is generating concerns for Lebanon's stability: banks are enforcing capital controls, dollars are scarce, and the Lebanese pound has lost a third of its value on a black market.
France hosts on Wednesday a meeting of the International Lebanon Support Group, which includes Gulf Arab donors such as the Saudi Arabia, major European powers and the United States."

Nadim Munla, senior adviser to caretaker Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, said the Paris conference would offer a political statement of support for Lebanon and recognize its unprecedented liquidity crisis.
""They will recognize that there is a short-term problem and that if and when a government (is formed) that basically responds to the aspirations of people, most probably the international community will be ready to step in and provide support to Lebanon, or additional support,"" he told Reuters.
""There will be a statement of support for Lebanon. This is the expectation. It is not a pledging conference.""
Lebanon is facing the worst financial crisis since the 1975-90 civil war. The liquidity crunch has led banks to enforce capital controls and the Lebanese pound to slump by one third.
Lebanon has also been in a political impasse since Hariri quit as prime minister on Oct. 29, prompted by protests against the ruling elite, with no agreement on a new government.
France has said the conference aims to press for the quick formation of a government to restore the economic situation.
Lebanon won pledges of over $11 billion at a conference last year conditional on reforms that it has failed to implement. The economic crisis is rooted in years of corruption and waste that have generated one of the world's heaviest public debt burdens.
The political impasse returned to square one on Sunday when a tentative agreement on a new prime minister unraveled.
Hariri is now seen as the only candidate for the post.
He has said he would only lead a cabinet of specialist ministers, believing this is the way to address the economic crisis, attract aid, and satisfy protesters who have been in the streets since Oct. 17 seeking the removal of a political class blamed for corruption and misrule.
But Hezbollah and its allies including President Michel Aoun say the government must include politicians.
""Let's see the coming few days and if there will be an agreement among the political parties on a formation ... otherwise we might take longer,"" Munla said. Hariri would be willing to have politicians in cabinet but they should not be ""the regular known faces of previous governments""."

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Gambia's legal team described mass rapes, the burning of families in their homes and killing of dozens of Muslim Rohingya children with knives as it set out its genocide case against Myanmar at the U.N.'s International Court of Justice on Tuesday.
Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace laureate, looked on impassively as the alleged atrocities were detailed at the beginning of three days of hearings in The Hague instituted by Gambia against Buddhist-majority Myanmar in November.
""All that The Gambia asks is that you tell Myanmar to stop these senseless killings,"" Gambia's Justice Minister Abubacarr Tambadou said in opening comments.
""To stop these acts of barbarity and brutality that have shocked and continue to shock our collective conscience. To stop this genocide of its own people.""
Suu Kyi is expected to repeat denials of genocide and argue that military operations launched in August 2017 were a legitimate counterterrorism response to attacks by Rohingya militants on security forces.
Detailing events at the village of Min Gyi, lawyer Andrew Loewenstein drew on witness accounts recorded in a report by U.N. investigators, who estimated 750 people were killed there, including more than 100 children under the age of 6.
""I entered the house with four of my neighbors and three of us had babies,"" Loewenstein quoted from one survivor's testimony to the U.N. fact-finding mission.
""There were dead bodies on the floor: young boys from our village. As we entered the house, the soldiers locked the door. One soldier raped me. He stabbed me in the back of my neck and in my abdomen. I was trying to save my baby, who was only 28 days old, but they threw him on the ground and he died.""
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after the military-led crackdown and were forced into squalid camps across the border in Bangladesh.
The U.N. investigators concluded the military campaign was executed with ""genocidal intent"".
Myanmar has previously denied almost all allegations made by refugees against its troops, including of mass rape, killings and arson, and promised to punish any soldiers involved in what it says were isolated cases of wrongdoing.
CALLS FOR JUSTICE
Outside the court, dozens of Rohingya demonstrated to demand justice for victims. Hours earlier in Yangon, Myanmar's commercial capital, thousands of people had rallied in support of Suu Kyi.
""It's like Mother Suu went to the frontlines for our country,"" said 58-year-old Myint Myint Thwin. ""Therefore to show our support and that we stand with her we joined this march.""
Once feted in the West, Suu Kyi has faced mounting international criticism over the Rohingya crisis. But she has remained popular at home since coming to power 2016 as part of the transition to democracy after decades of military rule.
A Suu Kyi supporter in The Hague, Moe Moe Hnin, said people abroad have been ""misinformed"" about events in Myanmar. ""Yes, military dictators have been committing human rights violations in the whole Burma,"" she said. ""It is not Burma, it is not Burmese people or our religion. We are not racist.""
This week's proceedings, before a panel of 17 judges, will not deal with the core allegation of genocide, but Gambia has requested a court order for Myanmar to halt any activity that may aggravate the dispute.
The tiny, mostly Muslim West African country is arguing that Myanmar's forces carried out widespread and systematic atrocities that constituted genocide during what the army called ""clearance operations"" against militants.
The tribunal has no enforcement powers, but its rulings are final and have significant legal weight.
In the Bangladeshi refugee camps on Tuesday, hundreds gathered on a hilltop and chanted, ""Gambia! Gambia!"", pumping their fists. Some offered special prayers at mosques in the camps and many others were fasting.

""Our people were killed, our children were thrown into fire, our women were raped, our houses were burnt down. All we want is a fair trial,"" said Nurul Amin, 30.

The Labour Party are trailing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party in opinion polls ahead of the election which will decide the fate of Brexit and the ideology that underpins the world's fifth-largest economy.
Labour's health spokesman Jon Ashworth said in the recordings that the situation in seats outside cities was ""abysmal"", blaming the party's Brexit policy and voters' perception of leader Jeremy Corbyn.
""I just can't see it happening,"" Ashworth said, when asked how to prepare for Corbyn becoming prime minister. The recording appears to have been made before last week's visit by U.S. President Donald Trump.
""Outside of the city seats, if you're in small-town Midlands and the North, it's abysmal out there. They don't like Johnson, but they can't stand Corbyn and they think Labour's blocked Brexit.""
Guido Fawkes is a website critical of Corbyn which says its aim is to campaign against political sleaze, corruption and hypocrisy.
Ashworth did not contest the contents of the recording but responded by saying the conversation was ""banter"" with an old friend who worked as an activist for the Conservative Party.
""We're going to win this general election,"" he said in a BBC interview. ""I was having a bit of banter with a Tory (Conservative) friend of mine - at least I thought he was a friend."""

Ahmed Ouyahia, who was prime minister four times, received a 15-year jail sentence and Abdelmalek Sellal, who was twice premier, was jailed for 12 years. They denied all charges, including ""misappropriation of public funds, abuse of power and granting undue privileges"".
The court in Algiers also handed 10-year prison terms to two former industry ministers, and sentences ranging from three to seven years to five prominent businessmen.
Many former senior officials have been in detention as the army seeks to quell mass protests that began in February demanding the prosecution of people involved in corruption and the removal of the ruling elite.
Tuesday's sentences marked the second verdict since September, when a military court handed long prison terms to the once untouchable intelligence chief and youngest brother of the former president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
Bouteflika resigned in April under pressure from the protests which began in February. Demonstrators say Thursday's election will not be fair because some of Bouteflika's allies are still in power.
The army has said the vote will be fair and an election is the only way to get out of the crisis.
Tuesday's verdict is linked to corruption in the car assembly business and ""hidden financing"" of Bouteflika's campaign for a fifth five-year term in an election that was scrapped earlier this year.
Among the businessmen jailed was Ali Haddad, a former chief of Algeria's largest business association, who was imprisoned for seven years. Former transport minister Abdelghani Zaalane was the only defendant acquitted.
All those on trial were allies of Bouteflika and denied the charges. Sellal's son, Fares, a shareholder in a car assembly plant, was handed a three-year jail sentence.
The court also issued a 20-year prison sentence in absentia to former industry minister Abdesslam Bouchouareb, who is abroad. An international arrest warrant has been issued by the same court.

The protests in the Chinese-controlled city have been widely covered in democratic Taiwan, which China claims as its sacred territory, and are frequently mentioned by Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) on the campaign trail as a warning on the potential dangers Taiwan faces from China.
Writing on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page over the weekend, Keith Fong, president of the Hong Kong Baptist University Students' Union, said the DPP only verbally supported the protests and had not enacted specific laws to support the protesters.
People would inevitably suspect that the DPP ""only wants to exchange Hongkonger's sacrifices for Taiwanese people's votes"", he added.
Tsai's main opponent in the Jan. 11 presidential election, Han Kuo-yu from the Kuomintang party which favors close ties with China, wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday that Tsai was using Hong Kong as a ""tool"" for votes.
Speaking to reporters later on Tuesday, Tsai said that Taiwan had always had a supportive attitude toward the people of Hong Kong taking to the streets to fight for democracy.
What is happening in Hong Kong has also put the people of Taiwan on alert and made them think that the freedom and democratic values Taiwan has must be protected with even greater strength, she added.
""Therefore, when they watch and listen to all the politicians, they pay special attention to the views and determination of these politicians or candidates on these issues,"" Tsai said.
""So I do not think we are using Hong Kong people to conduct the election; rather it is a process of self-vigilance by the people of Taiwan after what has happened in Hong Kong.""
Taiwan currently has no law on refugees which could be applied to Hong Kong protesters who may seek asylum on the island though its laws promise to help Hong Kong citizens whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons."

BEIJING (Reuters) - Government officials in a northwestern county in China face punishment after images of them burning books outside a library went viral, sparking concern on social media about the destruction of cultural and intellectual heritage.
In recent days a screenshot of an article about a clean-up at a state-run library in Zhenyuan, a small county in Gansu province, has circulated on Chinese social media, showing two women burning what appeared to be a pile of papers and books.
""The library has completely cleaned and quickly destroyed illegal books, religious publications, and especially books and articles with biases,"" said the article, which local media said was originally posted on the library's website, but was no longer accessible.
In a statement on Monday, the county government said there would be ""an in-depth investigation of the specific employees, who will be seriously held accountable"" for their actions.
""The employees did not seal and collectively destroy (them) according to regulations, but rather burned the 65 illegal books in the small plaza in front of the library,"" it said.
It did not say what punishments the employees would face, or give details about the books destroyed.
In October, the Ministry of Education called on school libraries nationwide to get rid of books ""that damage the unity of the country, sovereignty or its territory; books that upset society's order and damage societal stability; books that violate the (Communist) Party's guidelines and policies, smear or defame the party, the country's leaders and heroes"".
The Zhenyuan government propaganda department declined to comment on whether the book-burning was related to the national campaign and referred requests for comment to the library. Officials at the library did not respond to phone calls.
The Ministry of Education did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
While many comments and hashtags relating to the topic could no longer be found on Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging platform that is subject to official censorship, a few remained.
Many referenced the idiomatic phrase ""burning books and burying Confucian scholars"", an edict issued by China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, more than 2,000 years ago to destroy works he regarded as politically dangerous.
""These so-called illegal publications or religious publications could be a record of the culture of our times,"" one Weibo user said. ""After being destroyed, they may never be found again."""

Lembergs, an oligarch with substantial political influence in Latvia, was hit with a sanction by the U.S. Treasury that means U.S. citizens are prohibited from doing business with him and four companies he owns or controls which are connected to the running of the Ventspils port.
""Americans are being used in internal political infighting,"" Lembergs told a news conference in Ventspils. ""I don't have a chance to defend myself just like during Stalin's regime in the Soviet Union.""
Lembergs has been mayor of Ventspils, the second largest port city in Latvia with an important role in the country's transit industry, for more than 30 years.
Before Latvia's independence from the Soviet Union in the early 1990s Lembergs held various positions in the Communist Party. He has been a candidate for prime minister for former ruling coalition party The Union of Greens and Farmers, now an opposition party, and has business ties with Russia.
Lembergs was already suspended as mayor by Latvian prosecutors and courts due to an ongoing investigation and charges of corruption and money laundering. Lembergs has denied any wrongdoing in that case."

Turkey has said it is joining Albania and Kosovo in boycotting the Nobel awards ceremony to protest the academy's choice of Austrian Handke for the prize.
""Giving the Nobel Literature Prize to a racist, who denies the genocide in Bosnia and defends war criminals, on December 10, Human Rights Day, will have no meaning other than the rewarding of human rights violations,"" Erdogan said.
The academy's choice has been widely criticized.
Handke, now 77, expressed support for Milosevic and spoke at the funeral of the former Serbian president in 2006 after he died in detention during his trial at the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
Milosevic was charged with war crimes in connection with atrocities and ethnic cleansing committed by Serb forces in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo during the 1990s wars triggered by the disintegration of federal Yugoslavia.
On Friday, Handke dismissed questions about his support for Milosevic. On Tuesday, he will formally be handed the 9 million crown ($935,000) award and later attend the traditional Nobel banquet.
Handke is the author of books such as ""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" and ""Slow Homecoming"". He also co-wrote the script of the critically acclaimed 1987 film ""Wings of Desire""."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's new Peronist leader Alberto Fernandez will assume the presidency on Tuesday, a sharp gear shift from conservative Mauricio Macri as the Latin American country firefights rampant inflation, credit default fears and rising poverty.
The 60-year-old center-left politician will be sworn in by lawmakers in the historic Congress building at around 11 a.m. (1400 GMT) before taking an oath in front of his newly appointed ministers at the Casa Rosada presidential palace.
Fernandez's arrival marks a return of Argentina's powerful Peronist political flank, expected to usher in growth-focused policies after unpopular austerity under Macri, which could impact creditors and farmers in the giant grains exporter.
Supporters hope Fernandez can tackle annual inflation running above 50%, poverty approaching 40% amid recession, and tricky restructuring talks over around $100 billion in sovereign debt with lenders including the International Monetary Fund.
""I have hope that Fernandez will get us out of this disaster,"" said Julio Carlos, 52, a merchant at a clothing store in Buenos Aires, who emigrated to Argentina from Peru two decades ago.
In a reflection of shifting political allies, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel will attend the ceremony, but Brazil's right-wing leader, Jair Bolsonaro, who has clashed publicly with Fernandez, will not travel. It's the first time since 2002 a Brazilian president has not attended the inauguration in Buenos Aires.
In the central Plaza de Mayo, adjacent to the pink-hued palace, crowds will gather in the southern hemisphere summer heat with planned live music to celebrate the new government and likely hear Fernandez speak in the early afternoon.
At front and center for hard-hit Argentines, investors and markets are Fernandez's plans for Latin America's no. 3 economy. He picked Martín Guzmán, a young disciple of the Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, to head the key ministry last week.
Many investors have been worried about Fernandez ushering in greater state intervention, as happened under his vice president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, during her back-to-back administrations between 2007 and 2015.
Alberto Fernandez, a political operator who burst into the limelight just this year, will need to balance varied demands of his broad Peronist coalition and pressure from Macri's weakened, though still influential party.
With little financial firepower, Fernandez has worker unions demanding wage increases to make up for high inflation and charities calling for an increase in subsidies for the poor.
Political analyst Julio Burdman said this juggling act would be Fernandez's biggest challenge. ""He needs to do a rapid maneuver to get the economy started again, which will all depend on how he is able to handle the debt."""
763,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>",Philippines to end martial law in restive south,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines will lift martial law on the southern region of Mindanao at the end of this month, citing an improving security climate and a reduced threat of extremism two years after one of Asia's biggest Islamic State-inspired attacks.
Martial law was imposed in May 2017 in response to a surprise attack on the city of Marawi by local and foreign fighters loyal to Islamic State. The rebels held the city for five months, fending off daily air strikes and ground assaults before their leaders were reported killed.
President Rodrigo Duterte heeded the advice of a leading defense official that was unanimously behind ending martial rule, and is confident that order can be maintained without it, his spokesman Salvador Panelo said on Tuesday.
""The people of Mindanao are assured that any incipient major threat in the region would be nipped in the bud,"" Panelo told a regular briefing.
The move is expected to be welcomed across Mindanao, a region of 22 million people, where threats have been limited to mainly Muslim areas with a history of poverty, marginalization and separatist rebellion.
Though the government has cited success in dismantling the extremist networks, it is now faced with a sinister new threat from suicide bombings, which were previously unheard of in the southern Philippines.
There have been at least five attempted or successful suicide bombings since July last year in the Sulu archipelago, killing more than 40 people.
They include a twin bombing of a Jolo church and a van bomb detonated at a checkpoint on Basilan. Others targeted military outposts.
The country's Muslim minority in January overwhelmingly voted in favor of creating a new autonomous region within the Philippines called Bangsamoro, which will elect its own legislature and government and aims to end years of unrest and grievances."
764,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Malaysia's Mahathir pledges to step down for Anwar, but not before November","By Joseph Sipalan, Krishna N. Das and Matthew Tostevin
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad, the world's oldest prime minister, promised on Tuesday to hand over power to anointed successor Anwar Ibrahim in spite of new sexual assault allegations against him.
Mahathir, 94, told Reuters in an interview that he would not hand over before a summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries that Malaysia is to host in November but could be ready after that.
""I made a promise to hand over and I will, accepting that I thought that a change immediately before the APEC summit would be disruptive,"" Mahathir said.
""As far I'm concerned, I'm stepping down and I'm handing the baton to him. If people don't want him, that is their business, but I will do my part of the promise... irrespective of whatever allegation. I made my promise, I keep my promise.""
Asked if a handover could come in December 2020, Mahathir said: ""We'll look at that when the time comes.""
The turbulent relationship between the two men - allies turned fierce rivals who later reunited to win power - has shaped politics in the Southeast Asian country for decades.
Mahathir was unexpectedly elected in 2018 as the head of a coalition government whose largest party is led by Anwar, 72, who has been jailed twice on separate counts of sodomy and for corruption - charges he says were political.
Last week, Anwar denied fresh allegations by a former aide that he had tried to force him to have sex - describing the accusations as ""politics at its worst"".
It is Mahathir's second stint as Malaysia's premier, a post he previously held for 22 years from 1981 to 2003. Anwar was his deputy from 1993 to 1998, when the two fell out. Anwar was jailed the following year.
Although Mahathir promised to hand over to Anwar during the 2018 election campaign, doubts grew over his intentions when he later said he needed more time to steer the heavily-indebted country out of its troubles first.
Mahathir said he hoped for an out-of-court settlement with Goldman Sachs (N:GS) soon over the 1MDB scandal that sent Malaysia's debt soaring.
He also raised the possibility of selling stakes in state energy firm Petronas to oil and gas-rich provinces.
NOT TIRED
Firing back responses to questions from his perch on a sofa in his palatial office at Putrajaya on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, Mahathir said he did not feel tired despite his age because he was satisfied by his work.
""I try to do some minor exercise, but mainly I keep my weight stable,"" he said. ""I've been 62 kilos for the past 30 or 40 years, it doesn't change. I don't eat very much, and I don't eat... when food tastes nice. I don't overeat.""
As well as planning to be the first leader in the world to host the APEC summit twice, Mahathir has been pushing to cement his legacy as a leader in the Muslim world.
A summit in Kuala Lumpur next week would bring leaders from Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and other Muslim countries, officials said. Mahathir said the meeting would look into situations where Muslims were being oppressed.
That would include allegations of rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region, Mahathir said, while adding prospects for action by the Muslim world were limited.
""Taking a stand is one thing, doing something that can improve this situation is another thing. You take a stand which may well result in more pressures being applied and it is not going to do us any good,"" he said.
""The Muslim world cannot challenge anybody. We are very weak. Anybody can manipulate us, they can even make us fight each other. That's how we are.""
Mahathir has in the past said that China was too powerful to challenge over the accusations in Xinjiang, which China denies.
He has not spared fellow Southeast Asian nation Myanmar from criticism over treatment of Rohingya Muslims after more than 700,000 were driven into Bangladesh by a military crackdown in 2017.
With Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi set to defend Myanmar against accusations at the World Court in The Hague this week, Mahathir said he hoped that abuses would be recognized and accepted.
""We hope that they will be able to explain and accept the fact that there has been genocide carried out,"" he said. ""We hope that they will respond in one way or another to international opinion."""

WHAKATANE, New Zealand (Reuters) - Fearing the volcano could erupt again, search parties were unable to set foot on New Zealand's White Island for eight people still missing on Tuesday, after an eruption a day earlier killed at least five and injured more than 30.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said reconnaissance flights showed no signs of life on the ash covered island, and police doubted whether any survivors would be found, as eyewitnesses detailed the horrific burns suffered by those caught up in Monday's eruption.
""The scale of this tragedy is devastating,"" Ardern said in parliament. ""To those who have lost or are missing family and friends, we share in your grief and sorrow and we are devastated.""
Police said 47 people were on the uninhabited island, a popular sightseeing excursion for tourists, at the time of the eruption.
Twenty-four came from Australia, nine from the United States, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two each from China and the Britain and one from Malaysia.
""I would strongly suggest that there is no one that has survived on the island,"" police Deputy Commissioner John Tims said of the eight people still missing. 
Of the 31 injured, at least 27 suffered greater than 71% body surface burns, and some could succumb to their wounds, said Peter Watson, the government's chief medical officer.
Burns units across the South Pacific nation of 4.5 million are full to capacity, he added.
Police said an investigation into the deaths on White Island had been launched but clarified it was not a criminal investigation.
New Zealand's geological hazards agency GeoNet raised the alert level for the volcano in November because of an increase in volcanic activity. The volcano's last fatal eruption was in 1914, when it killed 12 sulphur miners. 
Yet, daily tours bring more than 10,000 visitors to the privately owned island every year, marketed as ""the world's most accessible active marine volcano"". 
""I have to say that I'm very surprised to hear there were visitors there today, because scientists seem to have been well aware that White Island was entering a phase of heightened activity,"" said Drexel University volcanologist Loÿc Vanderkluysen. 
""I've been to White Island before, but I don't think I would have been comfortable being there today.""
A crater rim camera owned and operated by GeoNet showed one group of people walking away from the rim inside the crater just a minute before the explosion.
""It's now clear that there were two groups on the island - those who were able to be evacuated and those who were close to the eruption,"" Ardern said at a morning news conference in Whakatane, a town on the mainland's east coast, about 50 km (30 miles) from White Island.
INCREDIBLY BRAVE
Later, in parliament, she paid tribute to the pilots of four helicopters that landed on White Island in the aftermath of the eruption.
""In their immediate efforts to get people off the island, those pilots made an incredibly brave decision under extremely dangerous circumstances,"" Ardern said. 
Since then, rescuers have been unable to access the island, which is covered in gray ash. GNS Science, New Zealand's geoscience agency, warned there was a 50/50 chance of another eruption in the coming 24 hours, as the volcano vent continued to emit ""steam and mud jetting"".
The Buttle family have owned the island for over 80 years, and a spokesman said they were devastated by the tragic event.
“We wish to thank everyone involved in the rescue effort, including the first responders, medical personnel and the locals who helped evacuate people from the island,"" Peter Buttle said. ""Their efforts have been both courageous and extraordinary.
Royal Caribbean confirmed several passengers on its 16-deck cruise liner, Ovation of the Seas, were on a day trip to the island but did not provide further information.
Janet Urey, 61, a nurse from Richmond, Virginia, said her son Matthew, 36, and his wife, Janet, 32, were cruise passengers injured in the eruption while on their honeymoon. 
""The phone rang at midnight. Then I heard a voicemail come on. It was my son. He said, 'Mom ... this is not a joke. A volcano erupted while we were on the island. We're at the hospital with severe burns.'""
Urey said she was frustrated by the lack of information from the cruise ship he was on and from authorities.
""I have not heard a word from the cruise people,"" she said.
A New Zealand man, Geoff Hopkins, whose tour group was just leaving the island at the time of the eruption, said he helped pull critically injured survivors into a boat. 
Hopkins, 50, who was given the tour as a birthday gift, said many of the survivors had run into the sea to escape the eruption.
""People were in shorts and T-shirts so there was a lot of exposed skin that was massively burnt,"" he told the NZ Herald newspaper. 
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said three Australians were feared to be among the confirmed fatalities, with 13 among the injured.
A website managed by the New Zealand Red Cross listed 17 Australians as missing. The Family Links website is a forum for people to register missing persons, who can respond to confirm they are safe. A person who has been found but is in the hospital, for instance, might still be marked ""missing"" on the list. 
Malaysia's high commission in New Zealand said one Malaysian was among the dead, while Britain's high commissioner to New Zealand confirmed two British women were among the injured. 
Russell Clark, an intensive care paramedic with a helicopter team, said the early scenes were overwhelming. 
""Everything was just blanketed in ash,"" he told Reuters. ""It was quite an overwhelming feeling.""
'Whakaari', as it is known in the Maori language, is New Zealand's most-active cone volcano, built up by continuous volcanic activity over the past 150,000 years, according to GeoNet.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A federal panel on religion has urged the United States to weigh sanctions against India's Home Minister Amit Shah if the south Asian nation adopts legislation to exclude Muslims from a path to citizenship for religious minorities from its neighbors.
Shah is a close associate of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Hindu nationalist-led government is seen by critics as pushing an agenda that undermines the secular foundations of India's democracy. 
On Tuesday, parliament's lower house approved the measure covering citizenship for non-Muslim minorities, specifically Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs, who fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan before 2015. 
The bill has prompted criticism at home and abroad, as it marks the first time India is weighing religion in granting citizenship, although it must first pass the upper house of parliament, where Modi's party lacks a majority.
The measure goes against India's constitution, which guarantees legal equality to people of all faiths, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said. 
""If the CAB passes in both houses of parliament, the United States government should consider sanctions against the Home Minister and other principal leadership,"" the panel said in a statement, referring to the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB). 
The panel is a bipartisan body that makes foreign policy recommendations to the U.S. leadership.
India's foreign ministry called the panel's statement inaccurate, saying the bill sought to help persecuted religious minorities already in the country.
""It seeks to address their current difficulties and meet their basic human rights,"" said ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar.
Hindus in Bangladesh, Christians in Pakistan and Sikhs in Afghanistan, all Muslim-majority nations, have faced violence in recent years, but India's opposition parties, minority groups and academics have said the bill discriminates against Muslims.
During Monday's parliament debate, opposition politician Asaduddin Owaisi ripped up a copy of the bill, calling it a move by the Modi government to render Muslims ""stateless"".
But Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which promised the measure in an election campaign that swept it to power in May, says the law is needed to help persecuted minority individuals in its neighbors.
""If minorities in our neighboring countries are being persecuted, then India cannot stay a silent spectator,"" Shah told parliament.
The bill is the third key election promise Modi's government has delivered since August.
The scrapping of autonomy for the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir and permission from India's top court for moves to build a Hindu temple at a disputed religious site have bolstered right-wing supporters, and diverted attention from a slowing economy. 

Now the BJP must win support from smaller regional groups to push the bill through the upper house of parliament this week.

Marin, 34, was the sole candidate for her government's top post after the resignation of Antti Rinne following a declaration of no confidence in him by a party in Finland's ruling coalition.
""While we believe in the idealism of young people, it is important also for them to consider the experience of the old people,"" Mahathir, 94, told Reuters in an interview.
""Then there will be a combination of the two, and that would be good.""
Marin has had a swift rise in Finnish politics since becoming head of the city council of her industrial hometown of Tampere at the age of 27. She will take over in the middle of a 3-day wave of strikes, which will halt production at some of Finland's largest companies from Monday.

Mahathir led the Malaysian opposition to an unprecedented election win last May. It is his second stint as Malaysia's premier, a post he previously held for 22 years from 1981 to 2003.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in will visit China next week for a trilateral summit with Japan amid rising tension over stalled denuclearization talks between North Korea and the United States, Moon's office said on Tuesday.
Moon is scheduled to arrive in China on Dec. 23, one day before the planned trilateral meeting in the southwestern city of Chengdu with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his spokeswoman Ko Min-jung told a briefing.
The leaders would review the recent situation on the peninsula and discuss ways to boost three-way cooperation to achieve denuclearization and permanent peace, Ko said.
Moon is also expected to hold separate talks with Abe and also Chinese President Xi Jinping during that trip.
The meeting comes amid a war of words that has rekindled in recent days between North Korea and the United States ahead of a year-end deadline set by Pyongyang for Washington to soften its stance in negotiations. [nL4N28J265]
North Korea has also conducted a series of weapons tests, including what it called a ""very significant"" test at its missile launch site on Sunday. [nL4N28I010]
Moon would seek to consult Xi on the recent developments as South Korea sees China as instrumental in reviving the nuclear talks due to its status as a longtime ally of North Korea, officials in Seoul said.
""We're watching very carefully various related circumstances that are happening between North Korea and the United States, and we're very cautious to forejudge anything and predict the future,"" an official at Moon's office told reporters.
The three countries had agreed to hold a summit every year to foster regional cooperation starting in 2008. But that initiative has often been dogged by bilateral feuds, including one between China and Japan.
Since the last such gathering in 2016, relations between Seoul and Beijing soured over the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile shield in South Korea, while South Korea's ties with Japan plummeted to their lowest in decades amid a bitter spat over history and trade.
Despite lingering tensions, South Korea made a last-minute decision to maintain its key intelligence-sharing deal with Tokyo last month. [nL3N282170]

Satoshi Uematsu, 29, is in detention awaiting trial for the July 2016 stabbings in Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture. The trial is set to begin on January 8 and a verdict is expected on March 16.
During 26 interviews with the newspaper, beginning in March 2017, Uematsu said he would not dispute the accusations against him and would ""admit"" all in court.
Uematsu's lawyer could not be reached immediately for comment. Prosecutors win 99% of their criminal cases when they first go to trial, according to data from the Supreme Court in Japan.
Uematsu worked at the care facility and while he said he was ""sorry to the bereaved families,"" he repeatedly said that the deaths ""couldn't be helped,"" Mainichi reported.
""There was no reason for them to live,"" Uematsu said in an interview in February 2018, describing the residents at the care home as ""people with failed minds.""
""I had to do it for the sake of society,"" he said, according to the newspaper report.
He spoke about his potential court sentence, suggesting at one point he would like to avoid execution and at another time that he would prefer the death penalty.
""If I'm not capable of taking responsibility for myself, then I'd prefer the death penalty. I don't want the subject of my ability to take responsibility brought up at the trial,"" he was quoted as saying.
In April this year, Uematsu told Mainichi: ""I didn't do anything that would warrant the death penalty.""
And in July, he said a heavy sentence would be ""unavoidable,"" but ""execution would be too much. I have no intention of being sentenced to die."""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A reshuffle of Hong Kong's cabinet is not an ""immediate task"", the city's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday, as she prepared to visit the Chinese capital for the first time since her government's humiliation at local polls last month.
On Sunday, pro-democracy protesters participated in the largest mass rally since their candidates scored a landslide victory in the district elections, raising further doubts over how long Beijing is prepared to back Lam.
Declaring her priority was to restore law and order after more than six months of often violent protests, Lam said at a weekly media address that she would depart on Saturday for a regular visit to Beijing, where she would brief officials on Hong Kong's biggest political crisis in decades.
With pressure mounting on her government, the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper, owned by pro-democracy publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, reported China was considering a Hong Kong cabinet reshuffle by the end of the year. Since the protests began until now, Lam has avoided mention of the prospects of changes to her team.
""My first priority now is really to restore law and order in Hong Kong and to ensure that Hong Kong could continue to move ahead, both economically and socially,"" Lam said during her weekly media address.
""This is not an immediate task that I would accord a lot of attention to,"" she said, when asked about a potential reshuffle. 
Pro-democracy protests have rocked the Asian financial hub and former British colony almost daily for months.
Sparked by a now-withdrawn bill allowing extradition to China, the protests have widened into calls for greater democratic freedoms and have have posed the starkest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. 
China has condemned the unrest and blamed foreign interference. In an editorial on Monday, the China Daily newspaper, which often reflects the views of Beijing, called on Hong Kong's government to uphold the rule of law. 
ECONOMIC IMPACT
The protests are also taking an economic toll, pushing Hong Kong into recession and hitting the tourism and retail industries particularly hard. 
Nearly 11% of licensed retailers in the semi-autonomous southern Chinese territory say they will have to close in the next six months, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association said on Monday.
Lam said she took comfort from the relatively peaceful protest on Sunday, although she condemned an arson attack on the city's courts. 
While the rally - which organizers said drew 800,000 people, while police estimated 183,000 - was largely peaceful, some protesters lit a fire outside court buildings and threw petrol bombs at government buildings.
Such a large and peaceful demonstration by people from all walks of life piles pressure on Lam and Beijing which have said the protests are stoked by radicals and rioters.
Activists plan another rally on Tuesday evening near the heart of the financial center to mark International Human rights Day. 
Police said late on Monday bomb disposal officers had defused two home-made devices on the grounds of a school in the district of Wan Chai. It was not immediately clear if the devices were linked to the protests.

More than 6,000 people have been arrested since the demonstrations escalated in June - nearly 40% students - while police have fired around 16,000 rounds of teargas and about 10,000 rubber bullets.

772,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 02:01AM ET</span>",Questions mount over tours to deadly New Zealand volcano,"By Charlotte Greenfield and Praveen Menon
WHAKATANE/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Tourists caught in the deadly blast at New Zealand's White Island were there despite a recent increase in volcanic activity, although experts said precise predictions on eruptions were all but impossible.
Five people were killed, eight are still missing and more than 30 were injured when the White Island volcano, one of the most active in New Zealand, erupted in a steam and gas explosion on Monday. Many of the visitors were on a day tour from a cruise trip in a nearby port.
Geological hazard tracker GeoNet raised its alert level for the island near the middle of a six-point scale in mid-November because of an increase in volcanic activity. But tour companies were not required to keep their dozens of customers that day away from the volcano, operators and agencies say.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said the government would investigate the incident.
""I have to say that I'm very surprised to hear there were visitors there today, because scientists seem to have been well aware that White Island was entering a phase of heightened activity,"" said Drexel University volcanologist Loÿc Vanderkluysen. ""I've been to White Island before, but I don't think I would have been comfortable being there today.""
Local tourism authorities market White Island, or 'Whakaari', as it is known in the Maori language, as ""the world's most accessible active marine volcano"".
The volcano attracts volcanologists and thrill-seekers from around the world to walk across the island's wild landscape, which features active geothermal steam vents and bubbling mud pools.
The privately owned island runs daily tours, and more than 10,000 people to visit every year.
""The eruption was unfortunate but not completely unexpected,"" said Jessica Johnson, lecturer in Geophysics at the University of East Anglia in the UK. ""The most that the scientists can do is continue to monitor the volcano and issue information when it is available.""
The regional government monitors the volcano's activity through GeoNet and other agencies. Tour operators, which must have government permits to take people to the island, can shut down access based on that data, tour companies said.
""The safety instructions, the discussion before you go, makes it very clear to you that this is an active volcano, there are risks, when you get handed over gas masks, so the tour companies go to great lengths to make sure people do understand exactly what this is,"" said Anne Tolley, local leader and parliament member from the East Coast.
Experts said it was difficult to predict exactly when a volcano would erupt. New Zealand uses a scale of 0-5 to rank volcano eruption risk, with 0 being no activity and 5 being a large eruption. On Monday, White Island was level 2.
Although there are signs scientists can watch for, they are more of an indicator of risk rather than predictive tools, said Toshitsugu Fujii, Head of the Mount Fuji Research Institute in Yamanashi, Japan.
""With a steam explosion it can be hard to see the signals until right before it happens,"" Fujii said. ""It seems that the volcano was getting more active and they raised the alert level, so they were paying attention. But you can't tell, even so, if it'll erupt today, next week or next month.""
Paul Quinn, chairman of Ngāti Awa Holdings, which owns White Island Tours, told Radio New Zealand that the alert levels over the last few weeks did not meet the company's threshold for stopping operations.
He did not say what specific criteria the company considered, but said that at level 3 it would ""liaise more directly"" with the government about whether to continue tours.

LIVE VOLCANO
Ardern acknowledged that tourism on White Island had been going on safely for decades.
""It has been a live volcano throughout that time and at various time has been level 2 but it is a very unpredictable volcano,"" she said.
There are dozens of volcanoes across New Zealand. The country's largest city, Auckland, sits on a volcanic field made up of about 50 volcanic cones and craters that have erupted over the past 250,000 years. Some get daily tours.
Mount Ruapehu on the central North Island has erupted several times in recent years but is still a major tourist attraction, with ski resorts on its slopes.
Injuries and deaths are rare for volcano tourism anywhere, data show. White Island's last eruption was in 2016, but no one was affected. A volcano on the Italian tourism island of Stromboli killed one person when it erupted in July.
When Japan's Mount Ontake erupted in a steam explosion September 2014, the peak was packed with hikers out on a weekend to admire autumn foliage. 63 were killed, the highest toll for an eruption in 90 years. Japan constantly monitors 50 peaks.
Tristan Vine, a Whakatane businessman, told Reuters that New Zealand's volcano tours are a big draw and that many businesses in the town rely on them.
""There's obviously plenty of other things to be done but White Island is built on the foundation of that. So it's quite critical for the town,"" Vine said.

The measures come as western countries step up pressure on Hun Sen over a crackdown on the opposition and after the United States expressed concern over Cambodia’s military ties with China.
The U.S. Treasury said it had sanctioned Kun Kim, a former joint chief of staff of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), over his role in a real estate development in Koh Kong province and his relationship with Chinese state-owned entity that he reaped significant financial benefit from.
""Kim used RCAF soldiers to intimidate, demolish, and clear-out land sought by the (People's Republic of China)-owned entity. Kun Kim was replaced as RCAF Chief of Staff because Kim had not shared profits from his unlawful businesses with senior Cambodian government officials,"" the department said in a statement.
Three members of Kim's family and five entities that are owned or controlled by these individuals were also sanctioned, the department said.
Cambodian tycoon Try Pheap, a member of Hun Sen's ruling party, was also sanctioned for building a large scale illegal logging consortium with collusion of officials.
Try Pheap's 11 Cambodia-registered entities were also sanctioned.
Kun Kim and Try Pheap could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.
Ruling party spokesman and Senator Sok Eysan said the sanctions were ineffective and only served as the support for opposition.
""They don't have assets abroad and if they are stupid to keep assets outside, let them freeze,"" Sok Eysan told Reuters.
""They did this just to support their puppets, it's not effective,"" he said, in reference to the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) which was dissolved in 2017.
The CNRP dissolution paved the way for Hun Sen's ruling party to win all the seats in parliament in an election last year.
The United States has called for the release of detained opposition leader Kem Sokha. It has also voiced concern at reports Cambodia is cooperating with China on a naval base, something Hun Sen has denied.
Cambodia has also come under growing pressure from the European Union, which is considering the scrapping of trade preferences over Cambodia’s crackdown on the opposition."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hit by a projectile fired by Hong Kong police while covering an anti-government protest nearly two months ago, Indonesian journalist Veby Mega Indah was blinded in one eye, but that has not blotted out the traumatic flashbacks filling her mind.
Working as an associate editor for Suara, a newspaper popular with Indonesian migrant workers in Hong Kong, Indah, 39, had been live-streaming in the Bahasa Indonesia language on the frontlines of demonstrations.
At the time of the shooting Indah was reporting on the street protests alongside other journalists from the vantage point of a footbridge. She believes she was hit by a rubber bullet. Whatever the projectile was, it has caused the permanent loss of sight in her right eye.
""I felt like I could not bear it anymore. I thought it's going to be my end,"" she told Reuters.
Indah recalled hearing fellow journalists behind her shout: ""We are journalists, stop shooting at us!""
The Chinese-ruled city has been roiled by more than six months of sometimes violent protests as activists call for greater democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions, among other demands.
Police, who have at times fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse demonstrators, say they have shown restraint in the face of escalating violence.
Indah and her legal representative told Reuters they have filed a legal request asking the police to name the officer involved in the incident so they can pursue a civil case, but that they have had no meaningful response so far.
Hong Kong police did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
While Indah still feels pain, she is adjusting to life with one eye, although she is still haunted by the experience.
""When I was in the hospital, I keep waking up because some images (keep) flashing back ... the projectile keeps coming back and coming back to my right eye,"" she said, while holding back tears.
She has been unable to return to work.

""Everything was just blanketed in ash. It was quite an overwhelming feeling,"" said Russell Clark.
The intensive care paramedic works with the Auckland Westpac Rescue Helicopter emergency service, which was sent to Whakatane to assist in the rescue efforts. Whakatane, on the North Island's east coast, is the main base for tours to White Island, about 50 km (30 miles) off the coast.
Clark said they had received reports of a number of casualties and multiple patients in boats as they flew to the island, and saw a heavily damaged helicopter as they arrived there.
""We were getting status updates so we knew there were high-acuity patients, very, very critical patients,"" he said.
""We didn't find any survivors on the island. And it was ... It would've been quite traumatic for them.""
Around 30 people were earlier evacuated from the island, many with burns. Five people died and a further eight were missing, presumed dead a day after the eruption.
Tourists from Australia, the United States, Britain, China and Malaysia as well as New Zealanders were among the missing and injured, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told the media earlier."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Bougainville will begin counting votes on Tuesday in its independence referendum, officials said, amid expectations for the South Pacific region once ravaged by fierce fighting to overwhelmingly back independence from Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Results are expected to be released on Thursday after the non-binding vote, held from Nov. 23 to Dec. 7, under a peace pact struck in the aftermath of a decade-long war between Bougainville's rebel fighters and PNG forces that ended in 1998.
Bougainville Vice President Raymond Masono said he anticipated an overwhelming vote for independence, but the region would need to rebuild its institutions.
""We envisage a long period of transition,"" Masono told Reuters. ""Bougainville is not ready for independence now, because we do not have the state institutions established. We are looking at 10 years.""
The civil conflict over the now shuttered Panguna gold and copper mine in what was once the resources heart of PNG killed about 20,000 people, coupled with the environmental damage related to the mining, hit almost every economic indicator.
Referendum results will trigger negotiations between the two South Pacific governments on the terms of separation. Discussion over how Bougainville would sustain its independence is likely to dominate the talks, two PNG ministers have told Reuters.
The referendum gave voters registered in the South Pacific island cluster, who number more than 200,000, a choice between independence and greater autonomy.
Ballot papers from different areas were mixed ahead of counting to eliminate the risk of reprisals.
""The vote will recognize the voice of all people of Bougainville – rather than by region,"" chief referendum officer Mauricio Claudio said in a statement."

PARIS (Reuters) - The leaders of Russia and Ukraine agreed on Tuesday to exchange all remaining prisoners from the conflict in east Ukraine by the end of the year, but left thorny questions about the region's status for future talks.
Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in their first face-to-face meeting, took part in nine hours of talks in Paris, brokered by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The conflict in eastern Ukraine that broke out in 2014 has killed more than 13,000 people, left a large swathe of Ukraine de facto controlled by Moscow-backed separatists and aggravated the deepest east-west rift since the Cold War.
The body language between Putin and Zelenskiy, a comedian-turned-politician elected earlier this year on a promise to resolve the conflict, was chilly. There was no public handshake, and they avoided eye contact.
But the talks did deliver specific commitments. A final communique set out the prisoner exchange and a renewed commitment to implement an existing ceasefire agreement in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region that has never fully taken hold as well as enhanced powers for international ceasefire monitors.
The sides also said they had agreed, over the next four months, to work toward local elections in Donbass, a major stumbling block up to now. There were no details though on how the votes would be conducted, and Macron acknowledged there were still disagreements on the subject. 
""We have made progress on disengagement, prisoner exchanges, ceasefire and a political evolution,"" Macron said at a news conference at which Zelenskiy and Putin sat separated by Merkel and Macron. ""We have asked our ministers in the coming four months to work on this.""
In addition, Zelenskiy said he and Putin had worked out the outline of an agreement that would allow the transit of Russian natural gas to continue across Ukrainian soil. He gave no details. A member of the Russian delegation said officials had been instructed to hammer out details.
However, there was no definitive agreement on the political issues that stand in the way of resolving the conflict. These include the status of Donbass within Ukraine and who should de facto control the border between Donbass and Russia.
Another round of talks in the so-called Normandy format, brokered by France and Germany, will be held within four months.
PEACE ELUSIVE
Ukraine's industrial Donbass region spun out of Kiev's control in 2014, soon after street protests ousted a pro-Moscow leader in the Ukrainian capital and Russia sent in armed men to seize Ukraine's Black Sea Crimea region. 
A 2015 ceasefire deal was signed in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. But fighting still flares up in Donbass four years on, and a peace deal has been elusive. Monday's summit was the first time the four leaders have met under the Normandy format since 2016.
Many Ukrainians are concerned about compromising with Russia. They see Putin as an aggressor seeking to restore the Kremlin's influence on the former Soviet republic and ruin Ukraine's aspiration for closer European ties.
Protesters who have warned Zelenskiy about making concessions to Putin in Paris were camped outside the presidential administration in Kiev, watching the summit news conference on a big screen.
Zelenskiy, who sparred verbally with Russian journalists at the news conference, said he had given no ground on Ukraine's sovereignty or territorial integrity. He said he and Putin had disagreed on several issues.
Asked who triumphed in their exchanges, Zelenskiy said: ""I don't know who (beat) who. I think it would be appropriate to be diplomatic as we've just started talking. Let's say for now it's a draw.""
Putin, for his part, is unwilling to be seen to bend to outside pressure over eastern Ukraine, and he does not want to be seen to be leaving the Russian-speaking population of Donbass at the mercy of the Kiev government.
He expressed only cautious hope for the peace talks. ""All this gives us the grounds to suppose that the process is developing in the right direction,"" he said.

Sticking to his cool tone, when he ended his remarks to journalists in Paris, Putin thanked Merkel and Macron warmly but offered no pleasantries to Zelenskiy.

(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said a Georgian man murdered in Berlin in August was himself a killer who took part in bloody acts on Russian soil and that Moscow's requests for his extradition had not been heeded.
Asked at a news conference in Paris if Russia would respond in kind to Germany's expulsion of two Russian diplomats over the man's killing, Putin said: ""There are unwritten laws in such cases: you expelled our diplomats, we expel yours.""
German prosecutors suspect Russian or Chechen involvement in the murder of the man in a Berlin park in August. Russia has denied any involvement and said last week it would retaliate for what it called Germany's ""unfriendly"" move.
Germany said last Wednesday it had expelled the two Russian embassy employees in protest over what it said was Moscow's lack of cooperation in the investigation into the murder.
The expulsions marked an escalation in already heightened tensions between Russia and Germany and other Western countries following the poisoning last year of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter on British soil.
Chancellor Angela Merkel told Monday's joint news conference with Putin, and the leaders of France and Ukraine, that she had told the Russian president in a bilateral meeting that Berlin expected Moscow to provide information for the investigation.
But Putin told the same news conference in Paris that the man had fought on the side of anti-Moscow separatists in Russia's mainly Muslim north Caucasus region.
""He is a cruel and blood-thirsty person. In just one of the attacks in which he took part, he killed 98 people. He was one of the organizers of explosions in the Moscow metro,"" Putin said, without offering evidence of his involvement.
On the killing in the Berlin park, Putin said: ""I don't know what happened to him. It's a criminal milieu and there, anything can happen.""
""But I believe that it is not appropriate to expel diplomats who have nothing to do with this, purely on the basis of preliminary conclusions,"" Putin said.
The Russian-Georgian victim, known as Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, was shot dead in August as he was heading to a mosque.
Surveillance camera footage showed the suspect had cycled up close to the victim who managed to push him over. The victim then tried to flee but the killer pursued him and shot him at least twice, German prosecutors have said.
There were sufficient leads to indicate the Russian state or Chechen authorities ordered the killing, they said, adding that Moscow had designated the victim, who had fought against Russians in Chechnya, a terrorist.

A suspect was detained soon after the killing and investigators had discovered his real identity. They named him only as Vadim K. or Vadim S. Der Spiegel magazine has reported his passport number links him to Russian security services.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Firefighters across Australia's east coast were bracing for a fresh wave of fires as temperatures across the country's most populous state were expected to soar.
More than 100 fires are ablaze in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria states, many of which have been burning for several weeks - including a single blaze that stretches more than 60 km (37 miles) in a national park north of Sydney.
Conditions were set to worsen on Tuesday as temperatures top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and winds are expected to start picking up, stoking fears that fires could spread to more populated areas.
""There are some that are much closer and with greater potential to impact on more densely populated or highly populated areas,"" said NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Bushfires are common in Australia's hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
Authorities have warned the blaze is unlikely to be extinguished until meaningful rain arrives - which is not expected for at least three months - and forecasts indicate the fire could be pushed toward larger population areas.
The wildfires have blanketed Sydney - home to more than 5 million people - in smoke and ash for more than two weeks, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and prompting commuters to wear breathing masks.
Sydney on Tuesday again woke to another thick blanket of smoke, with air quality rated as ""very poor"" at 1800 GMT, prompting warnings to avoid unnecessary exposure.

""Remain inside with the windows and doors closed, preferably in an air-conditioned building,"" the NSW state government's health department said.

Just days before Britain votes in an election he called to try to break the deadlock over Brexit, Johnson will repeat his desire to ""finally get Brexit done"" on a tour of traditionally Labour supporting areas he hopes to win over.
He will also hope to get his campaign back on track after he was criticized on Monday for his response to being shown a photo of a sick child lying on a hospital floor and after being heckled by a voter over his election tactics.
Johnson has put his oft-repeated pledge for a quick Brexit at the heart of his election campaign, hoping to win the backing of those who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.
The main opposition Labour Party has also said it will get Brexit ""sorted"" in six months, but its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has put more emphasis on policies to increase spending on healthcare and education, and increase the role of the state.
""If (we) do break free, there's a bright future waiting for us with all the opportunities of Brexit,"" he will say on a campaign trip to Staffordshire in central England, according to excerpts of his speech.
""We can literally rip up the EU rule book and write a new one for ourselves ... We can do all this and so much more if we regain our independence - we just need to vote for it, one more time, this Thursday.""
Opinion polls put Johnson in the lead before Thursday's vote, but some have shown Labour is catching up, and with so many Britons as yet undecided, the result is hard to predict.
Johnson's team hopes to break the opposition party's hold on voters in regions of northern and central England, the country's so-called red-wall, who have, sometimes for generations, rejected his party's overtures.
The Conservative message is a simple appeal to those Labour supporters who backed Brexit - only Johnson will get it done. Labour says even if Britain leaves at the current deadline of Jan. 31, that would only mean the beginning of what could be lengthy new trade talks with both the EU and other countries.
""The stalemate in parliament has held this country back for too long,"" Johnson will say. ""It's time to send in the bulldozers and smash through the gridlock."""

According to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Lembergs controls ""entities through political parties and corrupt politicians, and systematically exploits those entities and individuals for his own economic gain"".
""This U.S. action underscores the U.S. commitment to Latvia and our determination to hold corrupt oligarchs accountable for their actions against a key European ally"", it said.
The U.S. Treasury is also sanctioning four other bodies - Ventspils Freeport Authority, Ventspils Development Agency, Business Development Association and Latvian Transit Business Association, which are either owned or controlled by Lembergs.
Reuters was unable to get an immediate comment from Lembergs.
The U.S. sanctions allow the government to seize any property or accounts he has in the United States and prohibits anyone in the United States from doing business with him.
Lembergs has been a mayor of Ventspils, the second largest port city in Latvia with an important role in the country’s transit industry, for more than 30 years. He was suspended by Latvian prosecutors and courts due to an ongoing investigation and charges of corruption and money laundering. Lembergs has denied any wrongdoing in that case.
He is linked with the former ruling coalition party The Union of Greens and Farmers, now an opposition party, and has business ties with Russia.
The U.S. sanctioning of Lembergs comes at a time when Washington is increasing pressure on Latvia to overhaul its banking system, once prized by the country as offering a financial bridge for Russians seeking to move money to the west.
ABLV, Latvia’s third-biggest lender, was closed last year after the U.S. authorities accused it of money laundering.
The Latvian Foreign Ministry also issued a warning Monday saying that any financial institution carrying out a transaction with Lembergs or the four entities risk being subjected to the U.S. sanctions too."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and other countries seeking to use U.S. technology to develop nuclear power plants must agree to comprehensive U.N. inspections under legislation to be included in the defense policy bill expected to be announced as soon as early this week, two Democratic congressional aides said on Monday.
The measure, spearheaded by Democratic U.S. Representative Bradley Sherman, requires countries to sign the so-called Additional Protocol. The measure requires the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, to conduct snap inspections of nuclear power facilities to ensure countries are not developing materials for nuclear weapons.
The language is included in the annual National Defense Authorization Act, one of the few pieces of legislation that Congress must pass every year, the two aides said. The $700 billion NDAA bill could be announced in coming days after months of negotiations.
President Donald Trump's administration has long held quiet talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to build two nuclear power plants and could use U.S. technology to do so.
Lawmakers have been seeking more oversight over any deal with Saudi Arabia after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year his country does not want nuclear weapons but will pursue them if rival Iran develops them. Concern in Congress about Saudi Arabia's quest for nuclear power increased after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.
Nonproliferation experts said including the measure in the bill was a good step, but that Congress needs to do more. ""The bad news is it took Saudi misbehavior to get this legislation; the good news is we finally have it,"" said Henry Sokolski, head of the nonprofit group the Nonproliferation Education Center.
In September, former U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry sent a letter to Saudi officials saying any deal on nuclear power must also contain a so-called 123 commitment to forgo enrichment of uranium or reprocessing, two pathways to making fissile material for nuclear weapons.
Separately, a Republican congressional aide said legislation by Senator Ted Cruz to impose sanctions on companies building Nord Stream 2, a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, will also be included in the NDAA bill.
The Trump administration, like the Obama administration before it, opposes the pipeline, saying it will increase Russia's political and economic grip over many European countries.
Germany and Russia have said the pipeline, expected to be completed sometime next year, is a commercial project."

MADRID (Reuters) - France and a group of Brazilian states plan to announce a partnership to preserve the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, the group's leader said on Monday, bypassing Brazil's federal government after a spat between the presidents of the two countries.
Amapa state Governor Waldez Goes, who heads the consortium of the nine states that comprise Brazil's vast Amazon region, told Reuters that the partnership would be announced at the U.N. climate summit in Madrid this week and would include other initiatives aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Fires in Brazil's section of the rainforest, which accounts for 60% of the overall Amazon and is seen as a bulwark against climate change, surged in August to their highest point since 2010. The widespread blazes provoked an international outcry that Brazil was not doing enough to protect its forest.
French President Emmanuel Macron called for urgent actions to be taken on the fires, rapidly becoming embroiled in a war of words with Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.
Macron accused Bolsonaro of lying to world leaders about Brazil's commitment to preserving the environment. Bolsonaro at one point insulted Macron's wife and said he would only accept $20 million in aid offered by the G7 group of wealthy nations if Macron withdrew his ""insults.""
Macron said he thought Brazilian women must be ashamed of Bolsonaro, and suggested he was not up to the job of president.
Goes said the nine Brazilian states would announce a mechanism on Tuesday to allow foreign countries to contribute directly to state-level projects to preserve the Amazon.
He said that they had approached several European countries about funding such efforts.
The non-binding partnership with France could lay the groundwork for the country to provide eventual financial support to the states' environmental projects, he said. It was not clear whether talks will advance far enough at the summit for France to announce an amount that it would contribute, Goes added.
A spokesman for the French delegation at the conference declined to immediately comment.
Environmentalists blame Bolsonaro for Amazon deforestation hitting an 11-year high as he has prioritized economic development of the rainforest over conservation.
""The Brazilian President has in his official agenda the exploitation of the Amazon,"" said Nara Bare, a Brazilian indigenous representative at a protest outside the two-week climate summit in Madrid, which is due to conclude on Friday.
Bolsonaro has said the media has sensationalized the Amazon fires and demonized him."

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council will meet on Wednesday, at the request of the United States, over missile launches by North Korea and the possibility of an ""escalatory"" provocation after Pyongyang conducted what it said was a key test at satellite launch site.
The move comes amid growing tensions and stalled talks between the United States and North Korea that Washington hopes will lead to Pyongyang giving up its nuclear and missile programs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has given President Donald Trump until the end of the year to offer concessions.
Some diplomats and analysts are concerned that North Korea could next year resume nuclear and long-range missile testing that it suspended in 2017. Trump and Kim have met three times during that time, but no progress toward a deal has been made.
At least eight countries on the 15-member U.N. Security Council had been pushing for a Tuesday meeting on human rights abuses in North Korea, sparking Pyongyang to warn it would consider such a move a ""serious provocation"" and that it would ""respond strongly."" 
But the United States, which is president of the Security Council for December, decided to convene a meeting on Wednesday that will focus instead on the threat of escalation by North Korea, diplomats said. 
A U.S. official said earlier on Monday there would be ""a comprehensive update on recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, including recent missile launches and the possibility of an escalatory DPRK provocation.""
North Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The country has been subject to U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.
North Korea's U.N. ambassador, Kim Song, said on Saturday that denuclearization was off the negotiating table and lengthy talks with Washington were not needed. Pyongyang then announced it had carried out a ""successful test of great significance"" at its Sohae satellite launch site. 
Trump warned on Sunday that Kim risks losing ""everything"" if he resumes hostility and that North Korea must denuclearize. 
The U.N. Security Council has met behind closed doors several times over the past couple of months, at the request of European members, over missile launches conducted by North Korea. Following a meeting last week, the European states condemned Pyongyang's ""provocative actions.""
""The DPRK has conducted 13 sets of ballistic missile launches since May and continued to operate its nuclear program,"" Britain, France, Poland, Belgium and Germany said in a statement, urging Pyongyang to engage in meaningful talks with Washington on denuclearization.
U.N. Security Council ambassadors had lunch with Trump in Washington last week. 

Speaking to reporters on Friday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft said of the council's discussion about North Korea during the lunch with Trump: ""What we all agree upon is that we are very concerned about any more ballistic missile launches.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the first time on Monday at a summit in Paris aimed at advancing efforts to restore peace to eastern Ukraine. 
Zelenskiy and Putin are holding talks together with the leaders of France and Germany in a renewed effort to end a conflict that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014. (nL8N28F2Y1]
Diplomats however caution that the prospects for peace are bleak, with Zelenskiy, a comedian-turned-president, politically constrained at home and wary of conceding too much, and Putin showing little interest in bending to outside pressure.
After a series of bilateral meetings at the Elysee Palace, Putin and Zelenskiy entered the room for a meeting of the four leaders making little eye contact with one another and with no smiles. They did not shake hands for the cameras. 
""The main issue is a question of confidence-building so that we can move toward the objective of restoring Ukraine's sovereignty,"" said a French diplomatic source.
There has been scant sign of a peaceful solution to the crisis despite a 2015 ceasefire deal in Minsk. Monday's summit is the first time the four leaders have met under the so-called Normandy format since 2016.
Many Ukrainians are concerned about compromising with Russia. They see Putin as an aggressor seeking to restore the Kremlin's influence on the former Soviet republic and ruin Ukraine's aspiration for closer European ties.
Kiev wants to seal a lasting ceasefire in the Donbass region, the exchange of all prisoners, and a timeline for the withdrawal of all illegal armed forces from regions under the control of Russia-backed separatists, Ukrainian officials said.
The summit comes at a time Macron's overtures to Putin for a reset of relations have unnerved European allies, in particular former communist countries in eastern and central European countries who cherish their European Union membership and rely heavily on NATO for their security.
French officials say the Paris summit is a test for Macron's strategy. 
""As much as I am skeptical of Macron’s view of Russia, it would have been a mistake not to try unblocking the Donbass deadlock through a Normandy summit. Now let’s see what gives (or does not),"" said Brune Tertrais, Deputy Director of the Paris-based Strategic Research Foundation. 
Key to the Minsk accords succeeding are elections in the disputed eastern Donbass region of Ukraine, diplomats say. But both sides accuse each other of failing to stick to the 2015 deal, which includes restoring Ukrainian state control over the entire border with Russia and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the conflict zone.

After a NATO summit in London last week, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said Turkey had withdrawn its objections but added that the allies had not discussed how to designate the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia. 
Speaking also after the summit, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said NATO allies must not abandon Turkey in its fight against terrorists after it approved the Poland-Baltics plan.
Two days later Turkey's foreign minister said it would block final publication of the Poland-Baltics defense blueprint until allies agreed to brand the YPG a terrorist group.
""There is no going back from the decision made at NATO (last week),"" Krzysztof Szczerski, an aide to Poland's president, told Reuters on Monday. ""Decisions were made for both the Polish-Baltic and the Turkish plans and now we are waiting to implement the plans. That's a military matter."" 
On Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara had only given approval for the Poland-Baltics plan to move to another stage of debate, not full approval.
Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar reaffirmed on Monday that Ankara wanted both defense plans to be published together and said Turkey would not yield on its demands regarding the YPG.
""We allowed the Poland and Baltic plan, which is under revision, to pass the NATO Council and be re-evaluated at the military committee,"" Akar told state media.
""However, after talks with the NATO Secretary-General, we agreed that both plans should be published at the same time,"" he said, adding that Turkey was open to cooperating on the issue.
Turkey deems the YPG, the main component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as a terrorist group linked to Kurdish insurgents on its own soil, and has been infuriated by the support its NATO allies have provided the militia as a partner in fighting Islamic State militants in Syria.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Political leaders around the world could face growing citizen anger if they cannot re-engage with unhappy populations, a United Nations official said on Monday, as heads of state around the world grapple with protests.
Demonstrations in Latin America and elsewhere are connected to impatience with leaders who need to address the inequalities of the 21st century, said Achim Steiner, administrator of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), in an interview.
""Those who hold the power (...) need to recognize that unless they can respond to the particular sense of grief that people feel, their legitimacy will be challenged,"" Steiner said at the Bogota launch of the UNDP's annual report on human development. ""My hope is that these protests are in many respects a wake-up call.""
As countries rush to develop, the frustration of those who remain without access to higher education, the digital economy or services like broadband could fuel political tension, Steiner said.
The report shows that while the gap in basic living standards has narrowed, countries with low development are struggling with a new generation of inequalities, with the proportion of adults in very highly developed countries entering tertiary education growing six times faster than in low developed countries.
Broadband subscriptions grew 15 times faster in highly developed countries than in low developed ones, the report added. Climate change will also contribute to inequality, as those with fewer resources struggle to protect themselves from extreme weather and natural disasters.
""It is no coincidence that this is not a phenomenon of Colombia or of Latin America; it is happening worldwide,"" Steiner said. ""The political polarization and sometimes the explosion of protest are happening across the world.""
Recent protests in the region have also rocked countries including Chile, Ecuador and Bolivia. Elsewhere, there have been mass demonstrations in Lebanon and Hong Kong.
In Colombia protesters have organized a series of national strikes since late November. Led by trade unions and student organizations, protesters have laid out 13 demands to President Ivan Duque's government, including that it scrap plans to cut taxes on businesses.
""(Protests) are not born out of the moment but are more breaking out into the streets based on long-term developments and trends,"" Steiner said, adding that though protests have been triggered by different issues in each country, they reflect a ""underlying sense of concern, of frustration (...) a sense of a lack of fairness."""

He told state broadcaster TRT that Ankara would finance the resettlement on its own if allies did not provide support.
Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies launched the offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara views as a terrorist group. After seizing a strip of land inside Syria 120 km (75 miles) long and around 30 km (18 miles) wide running from the town of Ras al Ain to Tel Abyad, Turkey signed separate deals with the United States and Russia to halt its assault.
Turkey had previously said it could settle up to 2 million Syrian refugees in a 444-km (275-mile)-long ""safe zone"" it aimed to form in northeastern Syria, and repeatedly urged NATO allies to provide financial aid for the plans.
Turkey currently hosts more than 3.5 million refugees from neighboring Syria's 8-1/2-year-old war. Turkish officials have not indicated when any resettlement of refugees would begin.
""The Turkish nation can carry out an exemplary step between Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad,"" Erdogan said in his TRT interview, holding up a map of the region with markings on it. ""Settling one million people between Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain, that is our aim in the safe zone, that is our plan.""
Last week, Erdogan met his German, French and British counterparts on the sidelines of a NATO summit in London to hold talks on developments in Syria and his ""safe zone"" plan.
After the summit, Erdogan said one country, which he did not name, had pledged support for the plan but that Germany, France and Britain had not done so. He had previously said that Qatar could back it.
The European Union and Turkey's allies in NATO have rejected its calls for financial assistance and condemned the Turkish offensive, which they said might hinder the fight against Islamic State in Syria. Turkey has dismissed the concerns."

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson came under fire on Monday for his response to being shown a photo of a sick child lying on a hospital floor ahead of the Dec. 12 election.
Johnson's Conservatives lead the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls, with Brexit and the future of the country's public health service the two most prominent campaign issues.
During an interview, an  ITV  (LON:ITV) reporter repeatedly tried to show Johnson a picture on his phone of the 4-year-old boy lying on a pile of coats, which featured on the front page of the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror.
The newspaper said the boy had suspected pneumonia and had to be treated on the floor because there were no beds available.
Johnson initially avoided looking at the phone, and instead began describing his investment plans for the National Health Service (NHS) while saying he had not had a chance to see the photo.
The reporter said Johnson then took his phone and put it in his pocket. 
When challenged, Johnson took the phone out, looked at it and said: ""It is a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologize obviously to the family and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS, but what we are doing is supporting the NHS.
""On the whole I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had,"" he added, before saying: ""I am sorry to have taken your phone.""
Opposition parties were quick to share the footage on social media, saying it showed Johnson had no empathy for patients.
Health minister Matt Hancock later made an unscheduled visit to the hospital in the central English city of Leeds, saying he had been ""horrified"" by the picture. 
Asked if he had come because the Conservatives were panicked by the possible impact of the photo on the campaign, Hancock said: ""No, what people want to see is the substance of increased investment...making sure we are dealing with the problems."" 
BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said on Twitter that Hancock was greeted by a group of protesting Labour activists, one of whom had punched his adviser. She later revised this account, posting a video in which one of Hancock's team simply appeared to bump into the outstretched arm of a protester.
Separately, during a campaign visit near the northeastern city of Sunderland, a target for the Conservatives, Johnson was taken to task by a voter who challenged his party over a spoof website meant to distract voters from Labour's policy program.
Timed to coincide with the launch of Labour's manifesto last month, the website, http://www.labourmanifesto.co.uk, accuses the party of having ""no plan for Brexit"", proposing higher taxes and planning two more referendums.

Asked if it was fear of Labour that made his party set up the website, Johnson said: ""I'm afraid the short answer to that question is that I haven't got the foggiest idea.""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's government submitted plans to parliament on Monday to tighten its control over theaters, triggering protests from actors and audiences who feel that artistic freedom is under threat.
On a cold wet day, about 1,000 to 2,000 people demonstrated against the legislation in downtown Budapest, with banners saying ""Pigs, hands off the theater!"".
Leading actors, theater directors and Budapest's liberal mayor spoke at the protest against the bill which they say could undermine the independence of theaters.
""I am a democrat, and this is a step toward stealing yet another field that belongs to the public: this time the theaters,"" said Gabor Timar, 67, a retired bus driver. 
The ruling party of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban wants to pass the bill in an accelerated process this week.
A public petition urging lawmakers to reject the bill had gathered almost 50,000 signatures by Monday evening. Actors read out the petition at several theaters over the weekend. 
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) video, some of Hungary's leading actors and theater directors said the plans recalled the communist era, when the state controlled most aspects of national life.
According to the draft law published on parliament's website, which the government has softened compared with an original version leaked on Friday, a new National Cultural Council will be responsible for the ""unified strategic direction of various segments of culture"".
Hungary's minister for human resources, who oversees culture, would have a say in appointing theater directors at institutions jointly financed by the state and municipalities.
The minister and the relevant municipality would have to sign a deal defining the joint operation of a theater, including how to appoint its director, but this agreement ""has to guarantee the artistic freedom of the theater"", the bill says.
Since Orban won power in 2010, his right-wing Fidesz party has rewritten Hungary's constitution, gained control of state media, and businessmen close to the prime minister and the party have built empires. 
After winning a 2018 election, his third in a row, Orban said he had won a ""mandate to build a new era"".

A government spokesman told Reuters on Friday that a recent sexual harassment case at a Budapest theater made the changes necessary as the government currently has no power to sack the director of the theater involved.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday questioned why the BBC should continue to be supported by an annual fee paid by all viewing households, one of the biggest hints to date that the funding of Britain's main news provider could be upended.
The BBC, funded by what is in effect a 154.50-pound ($198) annual ""license fee"" tax on all television-watching households, has a central presence in British cultural life, with its TV, radio and online content reaching 92% of the population.
When asked by a member of the public on the campaign trail ahead of Thursday's election if he would abolish the license fee, Johnson said he was under pressure not to ""extemporize policy on the hoof"".
""At this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV license fees, although I am certainly looking at it,"" Johnson said.
""You have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a TV, a media organization makes sense in the long-term, given the way other organizations manage to fund themselves,"" he said.
The BBC has long argued that the license fee allows it to deliver hard-hitting and diverse news and entertainment to the whole of the United Kingdom while remaining independent from the state.
A BBC spokeswoman said: ""As we've said before, the license fee ensures a universal BBC which serves everyone, is the most popular funding system among the public, and is agreed as the method of funding the BBC for another eight years.""
BBC income in 2018/19 was 4.9 billion pounds, just over 75% of which came from the license fee - which was initially introduced just after the BBC's birth 97 years ago to cover radio sets.
The broadcaster has secured the compulsory license fee system until 2027 when its charter expires.
Director General Tony Hall said in July the license fee could be replaced with a Netflix-style voluntary subscription model after 2027, but the broadcaster would have to reduce the breadth of its output under such a model.
""You could decide the BBC is a subscription service,"" he told lawmakers. ""It would be very, very different to the sort of BBC you have now, because you would be giving subscribers what they want, not the breadth of the population.
""I would argue that's the wrong model for supporting the BBC.""
Viewers, however, are spending less time with the BBC and more time using video services such as YouTube, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime.
Media regulator Ofcom said in October the BBC may not be sustainable in its current form if it fails to regain younger audiences who are increasingly tuning out of its services, citing its research showing less than half (49%) of people aged 16-24 tuned into BBC TV channels in an average week in 2018.
The BBC is Britain's most-used online news source, Ofcom said, but its heaviest users are also in older age groups.

""The system of funding out of what is effectively a general tax bears reflection... how long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels, that is the question,"" Johnson said.

Joseph McCann, 34, was convicted of 37 offences relating to 11 victims aged between 11 and 71, committed in April and May this year. He kidnapped seven people during the spree.
He will serve 30 years in jail before he is considered for release. Sentencing him at London's Old Bailey Court, judge Andrew Edis said he was ""a coward, a violent bully and a paedophile"".
""You have never expressed a word of regret or concern for your victims. You are entirely obsessed with yourself and believe you are entitled to use other people in any way you want,"" he said. ""You are a classic psychopath; I don't think you will ever cease to be dangerous.""
The head of Britain's probation service has apologized for mistakes in McCann's case, after it emerged that McCann should have been in jail at the time of his rampage, having been caught committing a burglary while on parole for an earlier one.
Britain's system for monitoring and rehabilitating criminals has become a political issue ahead of an election on Thursday, after a convicted terrorist on parole killed two people in a stabbing attack on London Bridge on Nov. 29.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson accuses the opposition Labour Party of being soft on crime; Labour accuses the Conservative government of making the public less safe by under-funding the parole system.
HEINOUS CRIMES
McCann's attacks began on April 21, when he kidnapped a 21-year-old woman at knife point in Watford, north of London. Four days later, he kidnapped two more women in north London and subjected them to repeated rapes and sexual assaults.
They escaped when one hit McCann over the head with a bottle of vodka, but he eluded capture.
He then detained a woman in her home in northern England and sexually abused her children, aged 11 and 17, before raping a 71-year-old woman he attacked as she got into her car. He then kidnapped and sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl in the car before both escaped and alerted police.
The manhunt ended when police spotted McCann's car and cornered him hidden up a tree.
""McCann is one of the most dangerous offenders this country has ever seen and the sentence handed down today is a reflection of his heinous crimes,"" Detective Chief Inspector Katherine Goodwin said. ""We all had one ultimate aim – to bring McCann to justice and make sure no-one else will ever have to suffer at his hands."""

MADRID (Reuters) - Teen activist Greta Thunberg turned a spotlight on the struggles of the world's indigenous peoples against climate change on Monday, appearing at a U.N. summit alongside other young campaigners furious at the West's failure to tackle the crisis.
Indigenous communities from the United States to South America and Australia have mounted increasingly vocal campaigns against new fossil fuel projects in recent years, finding common cause with the young European activists inspired by Thunberg.
Pursued by a media scrum ever since arriving at the two-week conference last week after crossing the Atlantic by catamaran, Thunberg stayed largely silent during her first official appearance at the summit, to allow a young Native American, a Ugandan, a Philippine and a Pacific islander to speak.
""Their rights are being violated across the world and they are also among the ones being hit the most and the quickest by the climate and environmental emergency,"" Thunberg said of indigenous communities.
Indigenous activists argue that their communities contribute almost none of the fossil fuels emissions driving climate change, but bear the brunt of extreme weather and loss of wildlife. 
Rose Whipple, of the Santee Dakota, native to Minnesota in the United States, called for an approach based on tradition and technology.
""The climate crisis is a spiritual crisis for our entire world. Our solutions must weave science and spirituality and traditional ecological knowledge with technology,"" she said.
The meeting to address the implementation of a 2015 pact struck in Paris to limit temperature rises to well below 2 degrees celsius was shifted to Madrid after riots over inequality broke out in Chile, which had been due to play host.
""While countries congratulate each other for their weak commitments the world is literally burning out,"" said Chilean activist Angela Valenzuela.
The low-lying Marshall Islands became the first nation to comply with a requirement in the Paris Agreement to increase its planned emissions reductions in 2018, a move bigger emitters are under pressure to follow by 2020.

Six weeks since Saad al-Hariri resigned as prime minister, prompted by protests against the ruling elite, the financial crisis is generating concerns for Lebanon's stability: banks are enforcing capital controls, dollars are scarce, and the Lebanese pound has lost a third of its value on a black market.
France confirmed it would host an international conference in support of Lebanon on Wednesday, saying this aimed to press Beirut to quickly form a government to restore the economic situation.
But analysts saw little prospect of a quick end to a standoff that reflects an old power struggle between Hariri, who is aligned with Western and Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states, and adversaries including the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah.
""They are trying to see who can scream first and it is too dangerous a game,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center.
""There are deep miscalculations by all political sides about how this will unfold. The old type of politics does not apply.""
The impasse returned to square one on Sunday when businessman Samir Khatib withdrew his candidacy to be prime minister, after the Sunni religious establishment said it wanted Hariri in the job, which is reserved for a Sunni.
""INDISPENSABLE REFORMS""
Hariri has said he would only return to lead a cabinet of specialist ministers, believing this is the way to address the economic crisis, attract foreign aid, and satisfy protesters who have been in the streets since Oct. 17 seeking the removal of an entire political class blamed for state corruption and misrule.
But Hezbollah and its allies including President Michel Aoun say the government must include politicians.
Hariri has not commented since Khatib withdrew his candidacy. A political source said his position was unchanged.
A senior source familiar with the view of Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally Amal said Hariri should be now designated prime minister. This would enhance the legitimacy of the Hariri-led caretaker government if a new cabinet was delayed, the source said.
The economic crisis has been building for years due waste and corruption that have landed Lebanon with one of the world's heaviest debt burdens. Lebanon won pledges of more than $11 billion in financing at a Paris conference last year, conditional on reforms it failed to implement.
The French foreign ministry said Wednesday's meeting ""aims to detail the conditions required and indispensable reforms expected from the Lebanese authorities so that the international community is able to accompany Lebanon"".
Many people have lost jobs or had their salaries halved. In the space of one week alone, more than 60 firms had submitted requests to sack their entire work force, the caretaker labour minister said last week.
""The government will not be formed quickly,"" political commentator Rajeh Khoury said. ""The country is in a state of economic collapse and political bankruptcy."""

KOLKATA/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian karate teacher Monimala Halder took up the sport in her teens as a way to get fit. A few months ago, she and her sister used their skills to fend off two men on a motorcycle trying to grab them as they rode past.
""I caught hold of the pillion rider just as he was reaching out for us and we beat them up,"" said Halder, 35, who has seen a steady rise in the number of women seeking self-defense classes in a country where women and children have long been subjected to sexual violence.
Police shot dead four men on Friday who were suspected of raping and killing a 27-year-old vet near the southern city of Hyderabad.
Some rights groups and politicians criticized the killings, saying they were concerned the judicial process had been sidestepped, but the action was applauded by the victim's family and many citizens outraged by a rising trend of violence against women.
India strengthened its laws on sexual violence after the 2012 gang rape and murder of a woman on a Delhi bus led to an outpouring of anger. Reported rapes climbed 31% from 2012 to 2017, government figures show, which officials attribute to greater public awareness rather than an increase in attacks.
But a fresh wave of horrific assaults has sparked renewed anger with women across India increasingly turning to everything from karate lessons to pepper spray to take back control.
More than 100 showed up at two separate training camps in Kolkata on Sunday to learn self-defense techniques and volunteer groups are setting up similar pop-up camps in other parts of the country.
""I have learnt how to defend myself using daily items like a handbag, or a scarf, and also how we can use our knees to protect ourselves,"" said Anita Roy, 32, who attended one of the Kolkata camps.
In the northern town of Faridabad, Akanksha Kathuria, who has twin six-year old daughters, said she plans on setting up self-defense classes after reading about the Hyderabad case and that of a woman in Unnao, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, who died last week after allegedly being set on fire by her rapist and other assailants.
""I shouldn't have to raise daughters with the constant fear of something bad happening to them,"" she said.
PEPPER SPRAY
Self-defense experts say only a minuscule portion of India's more than 650 million women have access to such classes, and such camps are usually only accessible to those living in cities. Fewer still can commit to such programs long-term.
""Every time there is a major incident, we see a spike in inquiries,"" said Ritesh Reddy, who teaches self-defense in the tech hub of Bengaluru. ""But the challenge is learning self-defense requires a committed involvement.""
It is not just self-defense classes that have seen a surge in popularity. Amazon's Indian arm said pepper spray sales had spiked eight times since the Hyderabad case.
The top ten best selling ""safety and security"" items on Amazon's India site last week were pepper sprays, as compared to its portals in the United States, Canada or Singapore, where home monitoring devices and alarm systems were the most popular.
""We've run out of inventory in the past four to five days,"" said Rana Singh, proprietor of Bengaluru-based Aax Global, which makes the popular Cobra branded pepper sprays.
Singh said canisters designed to fit in a woman's handbag were the company's most sought-after product.
In the state of Uttar Pradesh, where more than 4,200 rape cases - the most in the country - were reported in 2017, victims have formed an organization, Red Brigade, aimed at empowering women.
""There is barely a school in the city of Lucknow where we've not conducted our camps,"" said founder Usha Vishwakarma.
Protests have continued across India since the deaths of the two victims in Hyderabad and Unnao with many people venting online about what they see as an endemic problem.
""This has to stop,"" said Mumbai resident Shraboni Lahiri, the mother of a four-year old girl said.
""It's not possible, or healthy, to monitor your child every moment of the day."""

""After getting our hostage back this week, fully ready for comprehensive prisoner exchange,"" Zarif said.
The United States and Iran on Saturday swapped prisoners - American graduate student Xiyue Wang, detained for three years on spying charges, and imprisoned Iranian stem-cell researcher Massoud Soleimani, accused of sanction violations - in a rare act of cooperation between two longtime foes.
Separately, Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei said Iran had always sought an ""all for all release"" with the United States.
""We are ready to cooperate to return all Iranians who are being held unjustly in America,"" Rabiei was quoted by the state news agency IRNA as saying.
Rabiei said efforts to swap prisoners were not linked to any other U.S.-Iranian talks, which would only be possible if Washington lifted sanctions and returned to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. 
Tensions have heightened between Iran and the United States since U.S. President Donald Trump last year pulled Washington out of the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Tehran's economy. Iran has responded by gradually scaling back its commitments under the agreement.
Washington has demanded that Iran release the Americans it is holding, including father and son Siamak and Baquer Namazi; Michael R. White, a Navy veteran imprisoned last year; and Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent missing since 2007.

Several dozen Iranians are being held in U.S. prisons, many of them for breaking sanctions.

""If we are a minority government we'll implement our program,"" McDonnell told Reuters. 
""I just warn the other political parties, we'll implement a program that has overwhelming popular support. If they want to press for a second election, we're happy to have that.""
Britain votes on Thursday in an election which will decide the fate of Brexit and the world's fifth-largest economy with a stark choice between Prime minister Boris Johnson's pro-market Conservatives and the socialist-led opposition Labour Party.
Johnson is forecast to win a majority at the election, but margins are tight and he could fall short of the 320-326 seats he needs. In that case, Labour could get a shot at forming their own government propped up by smaller parties.
McDonnell said a Labour minority government would set out its manifesto plans - including nationalization, public sector pay increases and investment in health and education - in a Queen's Speech and budget shortly after taking office.
He dared other parties to vote against them, and force another national election.

""If parties want to vote against those, well we'll go back to the people and I think those parties would be shredded,"" he said.

The Swedish Academy's choice of Austrian Handke has been widely criticized because he has expressed support for and attended the funeral of Milosevic, who died in detention at the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague in 2006.
A Turkey government official on Saturday called on the Swedish Academy to change the decision to award Handke the prize and Kosovo said its ambassador would not attend the awards ceremony on Tuesday.
""Consistent with our initial reaction, we have also instructed the Ambassador of Albania to Sweden to boycott the Nobel Prize ceremony for (Peter) Handke,"" Acting Albanian Foreign Minister Gent Cakaj wrote on Twitter.
""Justification of war atrocities during the Yugoslavia break-up must not be rewarded. This will solely strengthen the state of denial that must be overcome and strongly condemned,"" he said.

Russia has been stepping up its military presence in the Arctic, building new infrastructure and overhauling its ports as it vies for dominance in a region with huge untapped mineral wealth amid warmer climate cycles.
Other countries have also scrambled to boost their Arctic presence, stoking fears of intensifying geopolitical rivalry. In May, Washington accused Russia of aggressive behavior in the polar region and said China's actions must be watched closely.
Russia in September deployed its S-400 air defense systems to the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the far north, and the commander of Russia's Northern Fleet said on Monday that similar deployments would be made across the region.
""The plan is for all our Arctic divisions to be supplied with such complexes in the coming years and there will effectively be an air defense dome created over the Russian part of the Arctic,"" Vice-Admiral Alexei Moiseyev said.
""This means that the Arctic will be protected from any kind of enemy aerial attack, whether from planes, cruise or ballistic missiles,"" Moiseyev said in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry's Zvezda TV channel."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's two biggest parties agreed on Monday on a March 2 election date, barring a last-minute power-sharing deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fighting for political survival under criminal indictment.
A 21-day period in which parliament can nominate a legislator with majority support to try to put together a ruling coalition expires at 2200 GMT on Wednesday, triggering the legislature's dissolution and an election within 90 days.
It would be Israel's third national ballot in less than a year. Recent opinion polls have predicted no dramatic shifts among voters since inconclusive elections in April and September. 
Neither Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party nor the centrist Blue and White party led by his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, won enough seats in parliament for a governing majority in the previous two contests.
Both men were delegated the task of forming a coalition, but failed, throwing the ball into parliament's court. Their parties have been deadlocked in talks on a ""unity"" administration in which Netanyahu and Gantz would take turns as prime minister.
The two parties, which disagree over which man would serve first and for how long, announced they had agreed on the March 2 election date. The date needs parliament's approval but the two parties dominate the assembly so it is sure to pass. 
The political disarray and a long-running corruption investigation have threatened to curtail Netanyahu's decade-long hold on power. Last month, Netanyahu, 70, was charged with bribery, breach of trust and fraud.
Denying any wrongdoing, he has accused Israel's legal authorities of attempting a ""coup"" aimed at ousting a popular right-wing leader. Critics alleged that Netanyahu was trying to undermine the rule of law and set an election campaign theme portraying himself as the victim of ""deep state"" conspiracy.
As prime minister, Netanyahu is under no legal obligation to resign following the indictment. A caretaker premier remains in the post until a new government is formed - a process that could stretch months past a March ballot if coalition-building is taken into account.
Before the national poll, Netanyahu would face an internal Likud leadership election. No date has been announced and only one challenger has emerged, former cabinet minister Gideon Saar, with no signs of any broad party revolt to oust Netanyahu.

In a speech on Sunday, Netanyahu said he hoped to avoid another election, ""but if one is forced upon us, we will win big.""

At a party conference on Friday, SPD delegates appointed two critics of the coalition to lead their party jointly after months of turmoil and dismal performances in regional and European elections.
""We honor agreements and we want to serve and shape this country,"" Christian Democrat (CDU) Secretary General Paul Ziemiak told a news conference on Monday, with reference to the existing coalition deal.
""On the question of how we work with the SPD, I don't think it will get easier, especially if I look our dealings with each other, or at the party's leftward turn, if I look at how people in the party talk about each other,"" he added.
The parties will decide in the next few weeks whether their centrist alliance has a future after the SPD chose a more leftist leadership duo, who have demanded new policies on climate, investment and the minimum wage.
""There are no negotiations on the coalition agreement,"" Ziemiak said.
""So it's not the case that we are going in there with new proposals. What is important now is to look closely at the coalition agreement and see what else we need to get out of it.""
Budget policy is a point of contention for the coalition. Many conservatives are committed to achieving a balanced budget without issuing new debt.
But Norbert Walter-Borjans, one of the new SPD co-leaders, said on Friday that a poisoned environment, dilapidated infrastructure and technological regression ""would be a far worse debt to hand on to the next generation.""
Addressing the balanced budget issue, Ziemiak countered: ""If the state, with the revenues it's been making, hasn't managed in the past 10 years then how is it to do so if interest rates start rising or we have lower tax revenues?""
A collapse of the 18-month-old alliance could lead to a minority government or snap election, threatening instability in Europe's biggest economy at a time when many fear the strength of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Merkel, who has led Germany for the past 14 years, has said she will not stand for a fifth term."

JERUSALEM/LISBON (Reuters) - Danny Roup, Israel's celebrity weatherman, does not necessarily see clouds on the geopolitical horizon. But he thought it worth digging into his centuries-old family roots in order to get a second, Portuguese passport.
Roup is among thousands of Israelis who have embraced a citizenship offer by Portugal to descendents of Sephardic Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula during the medieval Inquisition.
Some applicants want to move to Portugal, or use it as a stepping stone to the European Union's educational and job opportunities. Others are seeking a reprieve from the turbulent Middle East.
""You can never know what will happen in this region in the next 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 years. So it's always good to have another passport, especially if it's a European passport,"" said Roup, 54.
Around 300,000 Jews lived in Spain when, in 1492, monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand ordered them and the country’s Muslims to convert to Catholicism or leave. Tens of thousands fled to Portugal, only to be persecuted there or expelled in 1496.
Portugal, which has seen a rise in applications since a similar citizenship offer to Sephardic Jews by Spain ended in October, describes its policy in terms of redress.
""Our history is a very important one but with certain shadows - and one of the most relevant shadows was forcing the Jews to abandon the country or to convert to Christianity,"" Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva told Reuters.
""We lost a lot of our Jewish influence and we are trying to retrieve this influence.""
The citizenship application takes around two years. Some 20 percent are approved.
Experts at one of Portugal's Jewish centers, Lisbon or Porto, vet applicants' genealogies and look for evidence of interest in Sephardi culture - for example, knowledge of the Judaeo-Spanish dialect Ladino.
Lisbon-based immigration lawyer Renato Martins said many of his Sephardic clients see the ""investment potential"" of a Portuguese passport, especially for real-estate.
Silva said most of the 44,000 applications received since the Portuguese offer opened in 2015 have been from Israel.
Ilan Dahan, 48, a father-of-three originally from Haifa, moved to Portugal after being approved in 2017.
""There were lots of wars, lots of bullets. We wanted to be safe, especially with kids,"" he said.
Roup does not want to leave Israel but says Portuguese citizenship could help his children, who can apply as adults.
""One is a singer. My daughter is an actress. So it will open doors,"" he said. ""I'm trying to make their lives easier now, in the present, and in the future."""

Anna Lindstedt was replaced as ambassador in February amid a furore over her alleged role in setting up the meetings with people representing the Chinese government, which Sweden's foreign ministry said had not been authorized.
Gui, a Hong Kong-based publisher of books critical of China's communist leaders and also a Swedish citizen, was abducted in Thailand in 2015 and later appeared in custody in mainland China.
""The ambassador is suspected of having acted outside the bounds of the authority granted to her during a meeting on a consular matter regarding the Swedish citizen Gui Minhai who is currently imprisoned in China,"" the prosecution authority said.
Prosecutor Hans Ihrman said it was the first time in Sweden's modern history that a diplomat had been charged with such a crime.
Lindstedt's lawyer said that she rejected the accusation.
""Anna Lindstedt repeats her very clear belief that the suspicions leveled against her are without basis and regrets the decision to bring charges,"" lawyer Conny Cedermark said in a written statement to Swedish news agency TT.
Cedermark could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.
Sweden's Foreign Ministry said its internal investigation into Lindstedt's conduct had been suspended while the legal case proceeded.
The Stockholm meetings took place in January this year. Gui's daughter Angela said in her blog that she had been invited by Lindstedt to meet two unidentified businessmen who could help secure her father's release.
Gui said she was advised to keep quiet about her father's case while negotiations were proceeding.
Sweden's Foreign Ministry said neither it nor the foreign minister had been informed of the meeting until afterwards.
Gui, 55, became a Swedish citizen after studying there in the 1980s.
After his 2015 abduction, he was released in October 2017, but his whereabouts were unclear until January last year when his daughter said he was seized by Chinese agents on a Beijing-bound train in the presence of Swedish diplomats.
China later confirmed it had detained him again. Beijing says Gui is being held on suspicion of revealing state secrets and intelligence on China.
Stockholm has accused China of preventing Sweden giving consular support to Gui, which Beijing rejects. Relations between the two countries have turned frosty.
In November, China's ambassador to Sweden threatened to blacklist Swedish Minister of Culture Amanda Lind for attending a literary award ceremony in Stockholm where Gui was honored."

GUWAHATI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in India on Monday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government offered a controversial bill in parliament that would give citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from three neighboring countries.
Home Minister Amit Shah introduced the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) in India's lower house amid raucous debate. Opposition parties stood against the proposed law that would, for the first time, create a legal pathway to grant Indian nationality on the basis of religion.
The bill was originally introduced in 2016 during the Modi government's first term but lapsed after protests and an alliance partner's withdrawal. It proposes to grant Indian citizenship to non-Muslims who came to India from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan before 2015.
Oppositions politicians inside parliament, and protesters in several Indian cities, said the bill discriminated against Muslims and violated India's secular constitution.
Shah and Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which had included the CAB as part of its manifesto in the last general election, insist that it is necessary.
""In these three countries, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians, followers of these six religions have been tormented,"" Shah said, before the bill was tabled after a vote.
'LAST DROP OF BLOOD'
But protesters returned to the streets in Assam - one of India's remote northeastern states that had previously opposed the bill - and blocked roads, burnt tyres and painted walls with slogans against the new proposal.
Student groups called for dawn-to-dusk shutdown in four districts of the state. Shops, businesses, educational and financial institutions remained shut and public transport stayed off the roads.
""We will fight and oppose the bill till the last drop of our blood,"" All Assam Students' Union adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya told Reuters, underlining the region's resistance against migrants amid fears that tens of thousands of settlers from neighboring Bangladesh would gain citizenship.
In Modi's home state of Gujarat and the eastern city of Kolkata, hundreds of people staged protests and marched against the proposed law.
In a statement issued on Monday, a group of more than 1,000 Indian scientists and scholars also called for the immediate withdrawal of the bill.
""We fear, in particular, that the careful exclusion of Muslims from the ambit of the bill will greatly strain the pluralistic fabric of the country,"" the statement said.
After going through the lower house of parliament, where BJP has a majority, the bill has to be passed by the upper house, where the ruling party enough votes. Any bill needs to be ratified by both houses of India's parliament to become law.
""Please save this country from this law and save the home minister,"" Asaduddin Owaisi, an opposition MP from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, told parliament."

PENSACOLA, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. investigators face mounting pressure on Monday to deliver answers on the motive that led a Saudi Air Force lieutenant to shoot and kill three people and wounded eight others at a U.S. Navy base in Pensacola, Florida.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, speaking at a Sunday evening press conference, said he was sure the gunman carried out an act of terrorism. He questioned whether it could have been prevented by better vetting of foreign military officers who train in the United States.
""There is a lot of frustration in our state over this,"" DeSantis said. ""You have foreign military personnel coming to our base. They should not be doing that if they hate our country.""
The FBI said it thinks that the shooter, Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21, acted alone when he opened fire inside a classroom at the base early on Friday morning. 
The bureau said it was not ruling out labeling the violence as an act of terrorism, but that it still had many people to interview on Monday and was still collecting evidence at what it called an active crime scene. 
The New York Times reported late Sunday that it had reviewed an official complaint Alshamrani lodged in April against an instructor at the base who had made derogatory comments about his appearance, but that there was no apparent connection between that incident and the shooting. 
The FBI confirmed on Sunday that Alshamrani had legally purchased somewhere in Florida the Glock 9mm pistol he used in the shooting. DeSantis said he was able to buy the firearm because of a ""federal loophole"" in gun laws that allow nonimmigrant foreign nationals to purchase weapons for an array of reasons, including if they simply have a hunting license. 
""I'm big supporter of the Second Amendment, but it's so Americans can keep and bear arms, not Saudi Arabians,"" the governor told reporters. 
Alshamrani was on the base as part of a U.S. Navy training program designed to foster links with foreign allies. He had started training in the United States in 2017 and had been in the Pensacola area for the past 18 months, authorities said. 

His fellow Saudi students were speaking directly with American investigators and were restricted to the base on order of the Saudi military, Rojas said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Drivers on two Paris metro lines voted on Monday to extend a walkout until the end of the week as France grappled with a fifth day of strikes, a sign transport workers will keep up a fight against President Emmanuel Macron's plans to streamline pensions.
The week ahead will test Macron's mettle and his ability to deliver the social and economic change he says is necessary for France to compete with powers like China and the United States.
The public sector strike has hit the transport sector the hardest. In Paris, train, bus and metro services faced severe disruption and monster tail backs clogged the roads as commuters took to their cars.
After months of consultations, Macron's pension tsar Jean-Paul Delevoye is scheduled to meet union leaders later on Monday before presenting his reform proposals to Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.
""We will see if he has not just listened, but heard,"" Philippe Martinez, leader of the CGT union, France's largest in the public sector, told France Info radio. ""They have to pull the reform.""
That appears unlikely. Philippe told the weekly Journal du Dimanche that he was determined to see through the overhaul of what is one of the most generous pension systems among developed industrialized nations.
The unions have called for mass protests on Tuesday and the government will be watching closely to see if more than the 800,000 who marched through French cities on Thursday turn out.
Macron wants to replace the convoluted system comprised of more than 40 separate pension plans, each with varying benefits, with a single, points-based system under which for each euro contributed, every pensioner has equal rights.
Public sector unions fret that their workers will come out worse because under the current system the state makes up for the chronic shortfall between contributions and payouts in the sector.
The unions, fighting to show they remain relevant after Macron loosened the labor code and reformed the state-run SNCF, also fret they will lose influence over contributions and benefits under a centrally managed points-based system.
Who emerges victor will in part hinge on the battle for public opinion. Opinion polls ahead of the strikes showed the public was relatively evenly split. On the metro on Monday, there was both sympathy and irritation toward the strikers.
""I don't understand. It's not the right way to do things, for (metro operator) RATP to block people like this,"" said commuter Charles Ramm. ""It will turn against the unions.""
Accountant Lamia Massoudi said she backed the strike, even if meant inconveniences. ""I'm with them,"" Massoudi said."

BOSTON (Reuters) - This city's deepest wound - the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three and injured hundreds more - will be re-examined Thursday when lawyers for bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev seek to have his death sentence lifted because the jury pool was too traumatized to render a fair verdict.
The then-19-year old Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan sparked five days of panic in Boston that began April 15, 2013, when they detonated a pair of homemade pressure cooker bombs at the race's packed finish line. The pair eluded capture for days, punctuated by a gunbattle with police in Watertown that killed Tamerlan and led to a daylong lockdown of Boston and most of its suburbs while heavily armed officers and troops conducted a house-to-house search for Dzhokhar.
Tsarnaev's defense team, in briefs filed with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, argued that the unprecedented shelter-in-place order biased the pool of potential jurors, including one actual juror who joined the unanimous vote for the death penalty.
The manhunt for the younger Tsarnaev, now 26, left an indelible mark on the city. Armored vehicles and thousands of National Guard troops cast a dragnet across the Boston suburb of Watertown. Just before a resident found a wounded Tsarnaev hiding in a boat parked in his backyard, a broadcast of a Boston police scanner channel attracted nearly 265,000 listeners.
""Even if a juror honestly believes before trial that he or she can objectively hear the evidence, when a community has been aroused to a fever pitch, the prospective juror may come to fear returning to neighbors with anything other than a guilty verdict and a death sentence,"" Tsarnaev's defense team wrote in a legal brief.
U.S. Justice Department lawyers disagreed, saying Tsarnaev received a fair trial. The department has noted a survey conducted for Tsarnaev's own lawyers found 96.5% of respondents in Washington, his preferred venue for the trial, had heard of the bombings.
But legal experts say arguing that some jurors were tainted with bias may offer the defense team its best bet in winning relief from the court. The defense and prosecution each will get an hour to argue their side before an appellate panel of judges.
""Of course, (the defense) will throw in the kitchen sink, the bedroom furniture and everything else in hoping something sticks,"" said Robert Bloom, a professor at Boston College Law School. ""That is what you do in these cases.""
The defense team says the trial should not have been held in Boston, that some jurors made false statements before their selection, and that the jury should have heard that Tamerlan had been a suspect in a 2011 triple homicide.
A friend of Tamerlan admitted to the FBI having committed the murders with him, according to recently unsealed court documents. The jury did not hear about those murders during the trial.
The younger Tsarnaev was sentenced to death in 2015 after a jury found him guilty of killing three people: Martin Richard, 8; Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 26, and restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, in the bombing; as well as murdering Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26, three days later as the brothers attempted to flee the city.
Before the bombings, the younger Tsarnaev had no record of serious criminal offense. But Tamerlan was aggressive, domineering and likely homicidal before driving his younger brother to join him in carrying out the bombings, according to the defense team's line of reasoning in court papers.
Tsarnaev's defense team also says the jury's foreperson falsely denied, during the selection process, calling Tsarnaev a ""piece of garbage"" on Twitter. That juror lived in Dorchester, the same neighborhood as the attack's youngest victim, according to defense team legal briefs.
During the trial, Richard's family asked U.S. prosecutors to consider taking the death penalty off the table. They said the death penalty could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of their lives, according to a letter published in the Boston Globe newspaper. A poll by the Globe also showed that about two-thirds of Massachusetts residents favored a life sentence for Tsarnaev."

THE HAGUE/COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Human rights campaigners supporting Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority on Monday called for a global boycott of the country, a day before genocide hearings begin at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
Myanmar leader and Nobel Peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who arrived in the Netherlands on Sunday, will defend her country's record during three days of hearings initiated after a lawsuit was filed by Gambia in November.
Suu Kyi's office posted a picture of her arrival at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, where she was greeted by the ambassador to the Netherlands and then headed to The Hague, where the tribunal, also known as the World Court, is located.
Several demonstrations are planned in coming days in the Dutch city by Rohingya survivor groups, as well as by government supporters.
Gambia, a tiny, mainly Muslim West African country, filed the suit in which the Buddhist-majority Myanmar is accused of genocide, the most serious international crime, against its Rohingya Muslim minority.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar in 2017 after a military-led crackdown. The United Nations has said the campaign was executed with ""genocidal intent"" and included mass killings and rape.
Myanmar authorities have strongly disputed that conclusion, categorizing the military operation as a legitimate counter terrorism response to attacks by Rohingya militants that killed 13 members of the security forces.
During three days of hearings, Gambia's legal team will ask the 16-member panel of U.N judges at the International Criminal Court of Justice to impose ""provisional measures"" to protect the Rohingya before the case can be heard in full.
Suu Kyi's office said last month that she would lead her country's team in The Hague to ""defend the national interest"".
REFUGEES PRAY
The Free Rohingya Coalition said in a statement it was starting the ""Boycott Myanmar Campaign"" with 30 organizations in 10 countries. It called on ""corporations, foreign investors, professional and cultural organizations to sever their institutional ties with Myanmar"".
It said the boycott was intended to ""to bring to bear economic, cultural, diplomatic and political pressure on Myanmar's coalition government of Aung San Suu Kyi and the military"".
In the sprawling Bangladeshi camps where they now live as refugees, some Rohingya said they were praying to see justice delivered. One man read aloud to a group from a newspaper article about the hearings.
""Once Aung San Suu Kyi was an icon of peace and we had huge expectations that things would change when she came to power,"" said 65-year-old Nur Alam, who said his son was shot dead by soldiers during the crackdown. 
""We prayed for her, but she has now become an icon of genocide... Shame on her.""
In her tent, 31-year-old Momtaz Begum shed tears as she recalled how soldiers locked her in her house in northern Rakhine state and set fire to the roof. She escaped to find her three sons dead and her daughter beaten and bleeding, she said.
""The army killed my husband,"" she said. ""They raped me and torched my house, they stabbed my 6-year-old daughter in the head. Why did they kill our innocent people, our kids? Why did they torture and rape our women? We demand justice.""
Myanmar has previously denied almost all allegations made by refugees against its troops, including of mass rape, killings and arson, and promised to punish any soldiers involved in what it says were isolated cases of wrongdoing.
In Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state in northern Myanmar near the border with China, hundreds of people marched in support of the Suu Kyi.

A mixed crowd, young and old, walked carrying posters saying ""we stand with our leader"" and wearing headbands with the slogan ""we stand with Mother Suu"". More demonstrations are planned in the major cities Yangon and Mandalay when the hearings begin.

Kem Sokha was arrested in 2017 and his opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) banned ahead of an election last year that was condemned by Western countries, who have demanded his release by veteran authoritarian leader Hun Sen.
Last week the court in Phnom Penh said investigators found enough evidence to proceed with the case.
""The Phnom Penh Municipal Court will hold trial for the accused Kem Sokha on treason charges... on January 15, 2020,"" the court's spokesman Y Rin told Reuters. 
Defense lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Kem Sokha was freed from house arrest last month but a ban on his engaging in political activity was kept in place.
His release has been demanded by the European Union, which is considering whether to remove lucrative trade privileges from Cambodia over its crackdown on the opposition, activists and the media.

The only evidence presented against him in public so far is a comment he made at a public meeting in which he said he was getting advice from unspecified Americans on election strategy ahead of a 2013 ballot.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 06:29AM ET</span>","Fire and petrol bombs after 'generally peaceful' Hong Kong march, police say","By Farah Master and Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong protesters lit a fire outside court buildings, threw petrol bombs and spray-painted graffiti on government buildings, following a ""generally peaceful"" march at the weekend, police said on Monday.
Protesters called for strikes across the city on Monday, but most railway and transport links ran smoothly during the morning rush hour and there were no reports of widespread disruptions. 
Vast crowds of black-clad demonstrators had thronged the streets of the Asian financial hub on Sunday, in the largest anti-government rally since local elections last month and a resounding show of continued support for the pro-democracy movement.
While the march appeared to be largely peaceful - in marked contrast to some other mass demonstrations over the last six months, where protesters fought pitched battles with police - authorities said there was some damage after it ended.
""Although the event was generally peaceful, acts of breaching public peace happened afterwards,"" police said in a statement on Monday. 
""Some rioters spray-painted the exterior walls of the High Court, threw petrol bombs and set fire outside the High Court and the Court of Final Appeal, damaging government properties and seriously challenging the spirit of the rule of law,"" police said, adding that shops and banks were vandalized in the Causeway Bay and Wan Chai areas of Hong Kong island.
Reuters reporters at the march on Sunday saw graffiti and protesters setting up barricades, but were not in the vicinity of the other incidents.
The Hong Kong Bar Association condemned what it called ""acts of arson and vandalism"" and said those responsible must be brought to justice.
Protesters estimated the turnout at 800,000, while police said it was 183,000.
Police said they arrested 42 people over the weekend for rioting, possessing weapons and other charges. Some 6,022 people have now been arrested in relation to the unrest since early June, police said.
'FED UP'
In an editorial, the official China Daily newspaper called on the Hong Kong government to uphold the rule of law. 
""Many residents in Hong Kong are fed up with the violence and disruption that have plagued the city for months,"" said the newspaper, often used by Beijing to put out its message.
Hong Kong's new police commissioner had said he would take a ""hard and soft approach"" to the demonstrations, where acts of violence would be treated harshly but other issues more flexibly.
The chairman and president of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong were denied entry over the weekend to the neighboring Chinese territory of Macau, without explanation.
Macau's security chief, Wong Sio Chak, on Monday said security concerns were the only reason for barring entry into the city, broadcaster RTHK reported.
AmCham Chairman Robert Grieves and President Tara Joseph had been traveling to Macau for an annual ball. The pair were told to sign a statement saying they ""voluntarily agreed not to pursue entry to Macau"".
Wong declined to comment specifically on their cases and said it was speculation that their refusal was linked to Beijing's response to U.S. legislation backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, RTHK said.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, linking the former British colony's special treatment under U.S. law to its autonomy from Beijing.
The unrest in the city of about 7.4 million people started in June as demonstrations against a now-withdrawn bill allowing extradition to mainland China. It has since morphed into calls for greater democratic freedoms and sometimes violent protests.
Protesters have set out five demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation into alleged police brutality. 

China has repeatedly blamed foreign powers, including the United States, for stirring up the unrest.

RIYADH (Reuters) - For decades, criminals in Saudi Arabia were lined up after Friday prayers at a central Riyadh plaza and beheaded by sword in a gruesome public spectacle overseen by the religious police.
These days, families sipping designer coffee stroll through what foreigners call Chop-Chop Square (NYSE:SQ), where the blood of the condemned once flowed. At night, diners drop 5,000 riyals ($1,333) at an alcohol-free restaurant imported from Ibiza.
Such jarring contrasts are accompanying the rapid social changes under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, like lifting bans on women driving, gender mixing and public entertainment.
Many Saudis embrace the new openness, but even supporters worry it might be coming too quickly and risks provoking a conservative backlash.
""The change is fast and extreme. We are people who are not used to change,"" said Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver Abu Mohsen.
One businessman compared it to sitting in the back of a speeding car, unable to see out the front and hoping the driver knows where he's going.
The festivities at the former execution site are part of the state's entertainment drive, aimed at capturing money spent abroad and encouraging fun.
New tourist visas have lured some holidaymakers, and temporary attractions like a safari, amusement park, and open-air theater have drawn over 8 million visitors to Riyadh since October.
Critics say the government is spending billions of riyals to distract Saudis from slower-than-expected economic growth and divert Western criticism of Riyadh's human rights record, including last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi which tarnished the crown prince's reputation as a reformer.
Despite the glitz, executions continue in less conspicuous locations, with at least 134 so far this year, according to the United Nations.
BACKLASH FEARED
Fears of a violent backlash spiked after a man stabbed three performers at a show last month. His motivation was unclear, but defiant Saudis blamed years of religiously-inspired hate speech, and shared a 2016 video of Prince Mohammed pledging not to let extremism waste another 30 years of their lives.
Yet one person told Reuters his conservative friends had privately cheered the attack, and some mosque preachers continue to rail against social liberalization.
""It was sadly predictable. I always expected a backlash,"" a senior Western diplomat said of the incident. ""It looks like the first action has been taken, and may inspire others.""
Some choices appear designed to signal to would-be conservative opponents that their time is up.
The main building in Chop-Chop, officially Safa Square, belongs to the religious police which Prince Mohammed neutered in 2016.
Now, water fountains dance outside, music blares, and an illuminated sign obscuring their logo reads ""Pulse of Riyadh"".
""There used to be punishments here. Now it has flipped 100%,"" said 21-year-old Faisal al-Kholaif, attending a performance in the square. ""We see joy, we see hope, we see everything has changed.""
Down the road in Diriyah, Saudis dance at concerts near the mosque of Mohammed Abdelwahab, the founder of Saudi Arabia's strict brand of Islam.
Meanwhile, restaurants are serving mocktails amid speculation alcohol could be permitted soon.
Such permissiveness could eventually elude the authorities' control. A woman wearing a face-covering niqab was referred to the public prosecutor after footage of her dancing in public went viral.
But another video shows U.S. rapper Russ flaunting a bra a fan had thrown onstage at a recent concert, and in one upscale cafe, a young Saudi couple was spotted stealing a chaste kiss.
A resident of the northern city of Hail, visiting Riyadh last weekend, said such things are very new for Saudi Arabia: ""Some people like it, others don't."""
818,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 06:19AM ET</span>",Justice Department watchdog to issue report on FBI handling of Russia probe,"By Sarah N. Lynch and Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department's internal watchdog is expected to announce on Monday that the FBI, despite some mistakes, was legally justified in 2016 in opening its investigation into contacts between President Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, according to sources familiar with the findings.
Michael Horowitz, the department's inspector general, is set to release findings from a review begun in 2018 of the politically explosive matter.
The Republican president has accused the FBI of improperly launching the investigation, including ""spying"" on his campaign, in a bid to destroy his candidacy and protect Democrats, and has advocated to ""investigate the investigators."" FBI officials have said the inquiry was launched because of legitimate concerns about unlawful foreign influence in U.S. elections.
Democrats have accused Trump of seeking to discredit a legitimate investigation that detailed extensive interactions between his campaign and Russia and long cast a cloud over his presidency.
Horowitz's inquiry focuses on whether the FBI made any serious mistakes or omissions when it applied to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) in 2016 to obtain a surveillance warrant to track the communications of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. This court handles U.S. government applications for electronic surveillance and other investigative actions for foreign intelligence purposes.
People familiar with the findings, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Horowitz concluded that the FBI had the proper legal basis to open the investigation. They said that Horowitz did find some mistakes in the process of obtaining the warrant, though this did not undermine the wiretap's legality.
The report is expected to fault some FBI actions. U.S. media outlets have reported Horowitz found that a former low-level FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, improperly altered an email submitted to the FISA court when the surveillance warrant was being renewed.
An FBI spokesperson declined to comment.
Horowitz's report will not be the final word on the subject. Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, in May appointed John Durham, a federal prosecutor in Connecticut, to examine whether the Russia investigation was properly predicated. Durham's work has become a criminal investigation.
The FBI investigation, launched in the summer of 2016 ahead of the November election pitting Trump against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, was taken over in May 2017 by former FBI chief Robert Mueller after Trump fired James Comey as the agency's director.
Mueller's 22-month special counsel investigation detailed a Russian campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States, harm Clinton and boost Trump. Mueller documented numerous contacts between Trump campaign figures and Moscow but found insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy.
Trump called the investigation a witch hunt and assailed FBI leaders and career staffers who worked on it.
STEELE DOSSIER
Trump's supporters have accused the FBI of improperly relying on a dossier by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele when it sought to justify to the FISA court the Page wiretap. Trump's allies have accused the FBI of failing to disclose that Steele was employed by a firm funded by Democrats to conduct opposition research on him.
Horowitz is expected to conclude that the dossier was not the sole piece of evidence used to convince the court, the sources said.
Clinesmith was identified during a congressional hearing last year by Republican congressman Mark Meadows as the ""FBI Attorney 2"" mentioned in a previous Horowitz report that examined how the agency handled its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state.
Clinesmith, former FBI attorney Lisa Page and former special agency Peter Strzok were found to have exchanged text messages critical of Trump.
In one instance, FBI Attorney 2 sent a message to another agency lawyer commenting about the amount of money a person under investigation had been paid while working on Trump's campaign. When the lawyer asked if that had made him ""rethink"" his commitment to Trump's administration, FBI Attorney 2 responded, ""Hell no. Viva le resistance.""
Lisa Page, not related to Carter Page, has since left the FBI. Strzok was fired over the texts and has sued the Justice Department, claiming wrongful termination.
While Horowitz found that the texts ""cast a cloud"" over the FBI's handling of the investigation, he concluded in that prior report there was no evidence showing political bias impacted its decision-making.
Durham's investigation's is ongoing. Durham and Barr traveled to Rome in September to meet with Italian intelligence officials about Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese university professor who, according to Mueller's report, had contacts with Russian intelligence officials.
According to Mueller's report, Mifsud met with former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and told him Russia possessed potentially damaging emails on Clinton. Papadopoulos was later charged with lying to the FBI as part of Mueller's investigation and pleaded guilty."

TAURANGA, New Zealand (Reuters) - At least five people were killed, up to 20 injured and several reported missing after a volcano that is a tourist attraction suddenly erupted off the coast of New Zealand's North Island on Monday.
Police said more casualties were feared on White Island, where the volcano erupted at about 2:11 p.m. (0111 GMT), spewing a plume of ash thousands of feet into the air. 
About 50 people, New Zealanders as well as foreign tourists, were feared to have been nearby and several were seen near the rim of the crater minutes before the eruption.
Many day tours visit the island regularly, and one from the Ovation of the Seas cruise liner was there at the time. 
Twenty-three people were rescued, police said, adding that others were still on the island.
""We are unsure of the numbers and unsure of their well-being,"" deputy police commissioner John Tims told a news conference, adding that rescuers could not access the island.
""The physical environment is unsafe for us to return,"" he said.
St. John Ambulance said up to 20 people were believed to have been injured in the eruption, adding that a mobile triage unit was on its way. The organization said it had sent seven helicopters with medics onboard. 
Michael Schade, an engineering manager from San Francisco, was one of the tourists who made it off the island just before the eruption.
In a video Schade posted on Twitter as he sped away from the island by boat, a huge plume of white ash soars into the sky as a group of frightened tourists huddles close to the shore.
""This is so hard to believe,"" Schade said. ""Our whole tour group were literally standing at the edge of the main crater not 30 minutes before.""
A crater rim camera owned and operated by New Zealand science agency GeoNet shows groups of people walking toward and away from the rim inside the crater, from which white vapor constantly billows, in the hour leading up to the eruption.
At 2:00 p.m. the crater rim camera catches a group of people - tiny specks in relation to the vast volcano - right at the edge of the rim. At 2:10 p.m. - just a minute before the eruption - the group is headed away from the rim, following a well-worn track across the crater. 
White Island is about 50 km (30 miles) from the east coast of North Island and huge plumes were visible from the mainland. Volcanologists said the ash plume shot 12,000 feet (3,658 m) into the air.
""We know that there were a number of tourists on or around the island at the time, both New Zealanders and visitors from overseas,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told a news conference.
""I know there will be a huge amount of concern and anxiety for those who had loved ones on or around the island at the time. I can assure them that police are doing everything they can.""
On Twitter, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australians had been affected by the eruption and the government was trying to learn more. Twenty four Australians were on White Island when the volcano erupted, Australian media said. 
Kevin O'Sullivan, chief executive of the New Zealand Cruise Association, said: ""We believe there is a tour party from Ovation of the Seas involved in the White Island eruption. We have no further details at the moment.""
Ovation of the Seas is a 16-deck cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean Cruises. It can take nearly 5,000 passengers and has a crew of about 1,500. It is docked at Tauranga, on the North Island, on a cruise that began in Sydney on Dec 3.
""We can confirm that a number of our guests were touring the island today,"" a company representative said in an emailed statement. ""We do not have any additional details to share at this time."" 
NO-FLY ZONE
There seemed to be no danger for people in coastal areas farther away, authorities said.
The eruption was unexpected, but not unusual, an expert said.
""Sudden, unheralded eruptions from volcanoes such as White Island can be expected at any time,"" Shane Cronin, a volcanologist at University of Auckland, said in comments published by the Australia Science Media Centre.
""We know hydrothermal and so-called 'phreatic' eruptions can occur suddenly and with little or no warning because they are driven by the expansion of super-heated water into steam,"" he added.
Geological hazard tracker GeoNet raised the alert level for the White Island volcano in November due to an increase in volcanic activity.
Just last week, GeoNet volcanologist Brad Scott said in a report that moderate volcanic unrest continued at White Island, with substantial gas, steam and mud bursts observed at the vent located at the back of the crater lake.
The White Island volcano is one of New Zealand's most active.
The White Island volcano's last fatal eruption was in 1914, when it killed 12 sulphur miners. There was a short-lived eruption in April 2016. 
White Island became a private scenic reserve in 1953, and daily tours allow more than 10,000 people to visit the volcano every year. 
'Whakaari', as it is known in Maori, is New Zealand’s most active cone volcano, built up by continuous volcanic activity over the past 150,000 years, according to geological hazard tracking agency GeoNet. 

About 70 percent is under the sea, making the massive volcanic structure the largest in New Zealand.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 05:55AM ET</span>",North Korea resumes insults of 'erratic old man' Trump,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Satellite imagery indicated on Monday that North Korea had tested a rocket engine, and a senior Pyongyang official called Donald Trump a ""heedless and erratic old man"", resuming insults of the U.S. president that had been set aside during a thaw.
The statement carried in state media KCNA by Kim Yong Chol, a ruling party vice chairman who was instrumental in arranging a failed second summit in February, was the strongest salvo yet in a war of words that has rekindled in recent days.
He described Trump as impatient, rebuked him over his own rhetoric and repeated a threat from last week that Pyongyang would dust off its previous insult ""dotard"" for the U.S. leader. 
Tensions have been rising in recent weeks as a year-end deadline approaches set by North Korea for Washington to soften its stance in negotiations. Pyongyang has conducted a series of weapons tests and issued strongly worded statements.
Though Trump regularly exchanged insults with North Korea in the first years of his term, both sides had abandoned personal attacks after Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in 2018.
The North Korean official said the country's leader may change his views toward Trump if the president continues uttering ""inappropriate, highly risky words and expressions"".
He pointed to remarks by Trump on Sunday that Kim had ""far too much to lose"" and did not want to interfere with an upcoming U.S. presidential election.
Those comments indicate Trump is ""an old man bereft of patience,"" the North Korean official said. ""As he is such a heedless and erratic old man, the time when we cannot but call him a 'dotard' again may come.""
""We have nothing more to lose."" 
North Korea had lauded a ""special relationship"" between the leaders even as it criticized other U.S. officials and their ""gangster-like"" demands during deadlocked talks. However, Pyongyang bristled last week after Trump again referred to Kim as ""Rocket Man"", a nickname Trump used early in his term. 
On Sunday, North Korea carried out what it called a ""very important"" test at its Sohae satellite launching station, a rocket-testing ground that U.S. and South Korean officials once said Pyongyang had promised to shut down.
Commercial satellite images taken on Saturday by Planet Labs showed vehicles and equipment likely to be used in a rocket engine experiment, said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. 
""They are mostly gone on Dec. 8, but the ground appears to have been disturbed by the exhaust from the test,"" Lewis said, citing photos captured on Sunday. 
Asked on Monday if it had been an engine test, a spokeswoman for South Korea's defense ministry said site monitoring and detailed analysis were under way with U.S. intelligence authorities.
SOLID FUEL 
Kim Jong Un has warned he may take a ""new path"" if the United States fails to address his demands. Observers have said that path might include the launch of a space satellite, which would help North Korea demonstrate progress in its rocket capabilities without returning to overt military provocations, such as firing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
Kim Yong Chol, the North Korean official, said Trump should try to ""stop the second-hand"" of a clock ticking toward conflict, instead of sticking to ""bluffing and hypocrisy that sound rather abnormal and unrealistic"". 
""We have no intention to reconsider what we should do in the future, and will not feel worried about our future action,"" he said in the English-language dispatch on KCNA.
Some South Korean experts said North Korea may have tested a solid fuel rocket engine, which could allow it to field ICBMs that are easier to hide and faster to deploy. 
""They may well have tried to see the thrust and duration of a solid-propellant rocket engine for ICBMs,"" a diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters. ""That's effectively what they can do on the ground at this point without firing anything into the air."" 
North Korea appears to have used Soviet-era liquid propellants in all its ICBM or satellite launches in recent years, while developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) based on solid fuel, officials and analysts say.
In March 2016, Kim oversaw a ""successful"" test of a high-power solid-fuel rocket engine. While inspecting a new missile modeled upon SLBMs in February 2017, he said the country's rocket industry had ""firmly transitioned"" to solid fuel from liquid propellants. 
""It could be solid fuel or they might have developed a new engine,"" said Jeong Han-beom, director of the Graduate School of National Security at Korea National Defense University. 

""In any case, it's meant to improve their capabilities for ICBMs, which need to be tested several times, while sending a message to Washington that we might go back to those old days of military confrontation if negotiations fail.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - People held in camps in China's Xinjiang region have now ""graduated"" and new trainees will have the freedom to come and go, the regional governor said on Monday.
Governor Shohrat Zakir also hit out at Western criticism of the camps and said the United States had launched a smear campaign against Xinjiang.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs and says the camps provide vocational training. It describes the detainees as students.
""At present the trainees who have participated...have all graduated,"" Zakir told a news conference in Beijing. ""With the help of the government, stable employment has been achieved and their quality of life has been improved."" 
Xinjiang will continue with training based on ""independent will"" and ""the freedom to come and go"", he said.
China has not provided any official figures on how many people have been held in the camps but Zakhir said foreign estimates were ""pure fabrication"". He gave no details. 
He also called a measure passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that condemned China's treatment of the Uighur minority a severe violation of international law and a gross interference in China's internal affairs.
""The U.S. is getting restless and has launched a smear campaign against Xinjiang,"" Zakir said. ""But no force can stop Xinjiang's progress toward stability and development."" 
Claims about the camps are hard to verify as China only allows periodic supervised visits and gives little information on their operations. 
In July, a Xinjiang official said most people had returned to society from the camps. Asked on Monday how many people had completed the training, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she could not give an exact number.
""Because the number of people participating in these training centers is dynamic, there's coming and going, so it's very difficult to give an exact number,"" Hua told reporters at a separate briefing. 
Human rights groups and former detainees have said conditions in the camps are poor, with inmates subject to psychological and physical abuse. 
At Zakir's news conference, images of past violence were displayed in excerpts from an English-language documentary, ""Fighting Terrorism in Xinjiang"" aired on state broadcaster CGTN last week. 
Hua expressed disappointment at the lack of foreign media coverage of the documentary despite the intense concern over the Xinjiang issue. 
She said there had been no terrorist attack in Xinjiang in the past three years due to the success of the camps. 
The U.S. Uighur Act passed by the House of Representatives last week requires the U.S. president to condemn abuses against Muslims and calls for the closure of the camps in Xinjiang.
It also calls on President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on a member of China's powerful politburo, Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo. 

The issue, along with Washington's support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, complicates prospects for a near-term deal to end a 17-month long trade war between China and the United States.

He also said Japan wants to make every possible effort to promote Middle East peace. 
Japan maintains friendly ties with both the United States and Iran, and has tried to ease tension between the countries, which broke off diplomatic relations after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
Citing a senior diplomatic source, Kyodo news agency reported last week that Iran had proposed the visit and that the proposal was relayed during a two-day visit to Japan by Iran's deputy foreign minister for political affairs Abbas Araqchi.
Abe said Japan would make every effort to promote peace in the Middle East but did not specify when there might be a decision on sending Japanese seamen to the region to guard ships supplying Japan. 
""As one of those efforts, we are currently in talks about a visit by President Rouhani to Japan,"" he added.
Abe did not give details but local media reported the visit could take place on Dec. 20 or 21. 
The Nikkei business daily said last week the government would propose deploying one escort ship and a patrol aircraft from the Maritime Self-Defense Force on a one-year mission that could be renewed annually. It plans to finalize the plan by year-end, the Nikkei said. 
Abe visited Iran in July and met with Rouhani and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during which Khamenei reiterated Iran's stance that it has no intention of making or using nuclear weapons.

Russian troops were shown in footage on the defense ministry's Zvezda TV channel shaking hands with Syrian children and unloading humanitarian aid bundles with the slogan ""Russia is with you"" from the back of trucks.
Raqqa was captured two years ago by U.S. troops and their Kurdish-led Syrian allies in the biggest victory of Washington's campaign against Islamic State in Syria. But since Trump abruptly ordered a pull-out in October, Moscow has swiftly advanced into territory where U.S. troops had operated.
Russia is a close battlefield ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, which was invited by the Kurds into territory they controlled after Trump pulled his forces out of the way of a Turkish assault against Kurdish-held areas.
Russian troops in Raqqa were handing out humanitarian aid and its military doctors were offering residents medical attention, Vladimir Varnavsky, a defense ministry officer, was quoted as saying by RIA news agency.
""Work in the city to get rid of the rubble and clear the area (of bombs or mines) is not yet complete and there is a shortage of clean water, medicine and food,"" he said. 
Russia last month set up a helicopter base an airport in a northeastern Syrian city and also landed forces at a sprawling air base in the region that had been vacated by U.S. forces.
Russia and Turkey are carrying out joint patrols along Syria's northern border with Turkey as part of a deal struck between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan.

After saying all U.S. troops would leave northern Syria, Washington has left some behind for now at some bases but rolled back most of their operations.

KUNDUZ, Afghanistan (Reuters) - The 19-year-old Taliban deserter is haunted by the memory of the attack on a police checkpoint in northern Afghanistan in August.
The Taliban band of around 20 fighters began its assault at 10 pm, he recalled, and by sunrise, all twelve Afghan police were dead.
Kneeling in the blood-soaked sand of the bunker as he and his comrades checked the bodies for weapons and ammunition, the young militant made a terrible discovery – one of the dead men was his elder brother.
Two months later, he fled following an air strike that killed several of his band. Now hiding in Kunduz district, fearing reprisals by the Taliban for deserting, the young man and his father told their harrowing story on condition of anonymity.
“I faced the darkest moment of my life seeing my brother's body covered with blood and dust,” the younger brother told Reuters, fear visible on his face as he sat inside a car. “For a while the daylight turned to a dark night as if someone put a black hood on my head.”
The father of the brothers said he volunteered the younger boy to fight for the Taliban after the militants learnt that the elder son was with the police.
The government accuses the Taliban of commonly using the tactic to intimidate families caught up in the 18-year-long war.
""The Taliban torture and even kill innocent people to make them to join, mostly in remote rural areas where people have no other option,"" said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan government.
The militant group denies this, though it said it does pressurize families not to join the security services of a government it regards as illegitimate and propped up by foreign forces.
FINE BALANCE
The family, like many in the northern Kunduz province, make a difficult living subsistence farming wheat, rice and mung beans. To ease the hardship, the elder brother enlisted in police in 2006 to help support his family, his father said.
A few months later, he recalled Taliban representatives visiting his mud-brick home to persuade him to make a fateful choice - either he should make his elder son quit the police, or he should volunteer one of his seven other sons to join the militants.
“It was a difficult decision for the whole family, but we had no other choice: the Taliban were extorting us,” he said, a sense of resignation in his voice, on why he allowed his youngest son to join. “They blocked the water to our crops.”
He knew the impact his decision might have.
“Having a son in the police and giving the other to the Taliban means telling them to kill each other,” he said.
The Taliban now controls more territory than at any point since it was ousted from power by U.S.-led coalition forces in 2001. With that gain comes increasing friction with Afghans who have lived in what were previously government-held areas, experts said.
“The Taliban are not aliens: they are undeniable part of Afghan society,” said Atiqullah Amarkhel, a former general who served in the Afghan army between 1960 and 2009.
“Many families of members of the Afghan security forces are living in rural areas and most of these areas are either completely controlled or heavily influenced by the Taliban.”
Similar stories have emerged elsewhere in the country.
Hikmatullah, a sergeant in the Afghan army from the eastern Nangarhar province, said the Taliban imprisoned one of his younger brothers after he joined the security forces. They eventually released him, but after consulting with his father, he too joined the militant group.
“This decision was not his choice or desire, but he was forced, in fact the whole family was forced because we were frustrated from the daily torture,” Hikmatullah, who goes by only one name, said.
“Whenever I get into a clash with the Taliban, I feel that my brother is standing in front of me and I am firing at him.”
Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, denied it coerced people to join.
“We sometime force those families not to serve in the front line with the Afghan police or army, because we don’t want them to lose their precious lives,” he said. “Joining us is their personal choice.”
The former Taliban fighter was deeply affected by his brother’s death in the raid. In October, after an Afghan airstrike killed five of his comrades in the Taliban, he fled.
He now lives away from the family's land with his father and brother’s family.
“Whenever I look to the three children of my late brother, I feel guilty as if I am the killer,” he said. “I don't forgive myself.”"

The Interior Ministry, which made the announcement, gave no details. France's Foreign Ministry declined to comment, but diplomatic sources said the 11 included four women and seven children.
Turkey is holding hundreds of Islamic State suspects and last month launched a program to repatriate detainees that has caused friction with its NATO allies.
Ankara has accused European countries of being too slow to take back citizens who traveled to the Middle East to fight.
Turkey's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said in November that Turkey will repatriate most detainees with suspected links to Islamic State by the end of this year.
The move is forcing European capitals to decide how to handle the return of radicalized militants, including those with battlefield experience.
Paris signed an agreement with Turkey five years ago for French nationals arrested by Turkish authorities to be deported in coordination with French authorities. Almost 300 French nationals have been expelled by Turkey since then, according to French officials.

COX'S BAZAR (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims demanded Myanmar be held to account at the United Nations' top court in The Hague, where Myanmar leader and Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is set to defend the country against charges of genocide of the minority community.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar in 2017 after a brutal military-led crackdown the U.N. has said was executed with ""genocidal intent"" and included mass killings and rape.
Myanmar vehemently denies allegations of genocide. Myanmar says its military campaign across hundreds of villages in northern Rakhine state was in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.
Rohingya Muslims housed in sprawling refugee camps in southern Bangladesh reacted strongly on Monday to the prospect of Suu Kyi appearing this week at The International Court of Justice in hearings set for Dec. 10 to 12.
Here are some quotes from individuals:
Mohammed Zobayer, 19, who teaches at a learning center in the camps:
""We witnessed rape, torture and killings. We saw many killed before our eyes. All we could do was run while our homes burned. Now it is time for the global community to act and hold Myanmar accountable for the horrific crimes they committed. They must be held accountable for genocide against the Rohingya.
""Suu Kyi spoke of rape being used by the army as a weapon before she came to power, but she is now the defender of the army. Shame!
""We are eagerly waiting for the hearings ... but are not sure if we will be able to hear it at all because of the poor internet connectivity here.""
Nur Alam, 65, whose son was shot dead by the army after the August 2017 crackdown:
""Once Aung San Suu Kyi was an icon of peace and we had huge expectations that things would change when she came to power. We prayed for her, but she has now become an icon of genocide. Instead of protecting us, she has joined hands with the killers. Now she is going to defend the killers. We hate her. Shame on her.
""She and the army and the killers of my son must all be punished. I have longed for this day to come. I'll have no regrets in life if I see they are punished.""
Rashid Ahmed, 35, who says 12 of his family members were killed by the Myanmar army:
""Only justice can heal our wounds. I know I'll never get them back, but they will rest in peace when their killers are punished.""
Momtaz Begum, 31, holding her three-year-old son in her lap, said in tears:
""The army killed my husband. They raped me and torched my house, they stabbed my six-year-old daughter in the head. I have learned that there will be a trial of Aung San Suu Kyi and the army. We demand the trial of Suu Kyi and the military. Why did they kill our innocent people, our kids? Why did they torture and rape our women? We demand justice."" 
Jamalida Begum, 29, who said she was raped by the army in 2016 after her husband was killed:
""The military came to my village and killed my husband and burned my house. Three soldiers dragged me to a bush and pointed a gun at me and raped me until I lost consciousness.
""I fled here after the army put up large posters with my photo and went door-to-door looking for me because I gave interviews to foreign journalists after the brutal incident.
""All I want is justice. I want the punishment of those who raped us, killed our people, torched our houses, threw our children into the fire."""

The British parliament has approved an expansion plan for Heathrow, including building the first full-length new runway in the London area for 70 years, but the plans are being challenged in the courts.
Before he won the top job, Johnson opposed Heathrow expansion and promised to lie down before bulldozers to stop it.
""On Heathrow, it's a private sector project which is still to satisfy its strict legal obligations on air quality and noise pollution,"" Johnson told LBC radio.
""I don't see much sign of any bulldozers yet... I would have to find some way of honoring that promise. It might be technically difficult to achieve... Let's wait and see when the bulldozers arrive.""
Asked about a HS2, a proposed high-speed rail project to improve links from London to central and northern England, Johnson said the cost would be more than 100 billion pounds ($128 billion).
""If you come in with a project that's north than a hundred billion probably, you've got to ask yourself, it's only responsible to the taxpayer, to ask whether it's being sensibly spent and whether that funding is being prioritized right,"" Johnson said. The previous estimate was between 81 and 88 billion pounds.

""Looking at the way these things go, it probably will come on at north of a hundred billion but at the moment you're right it's eighty eight and that's a lot of money and there will be serious questions about whether that is... right.""

Muscat is not directly implicated in the investigation but has said he will resign in mid-January after an election for a new leader of his ruling Labour Party. Testimony by the self-confessed middleman in the murder plan has linked people in the prime minister's inner circle to attempts at a cover-up.
About 40 activists surprised policemen and soldiers as they forced their way into the 16th century building in the capital Valletta from a side entrance, armed with drums, whistles, flags and loud hailers.
They then sat down and blocked the entrance, chanting for Muscat to quit. He was not in the building at the time.
The political stability of the tiny Mediterranean island has been rocked in recent weeks by the fallout from the murder of the anti-corruption journalist, who was blown up by a car bomb.
Muscat's chief of staff Keith Schembri was named among those involved or having known about the plot. Schembri has resigned and is under investigation. He has denied any wrongdoing.
""Malta has reached rock bottom. This is not just about corruption, but about political murder,"" the activists said over a loud hailer during their protest. 
They said Muscat's position was untenable and demanded a comprehensive investigation of all the people named, ""not a cover-up"".

Police and soldiers watched over the activists who made no attempt to go upstairs, where the administrative offices are located.

The governing Social Democrats and Greens, along with the centre-right Liberal and Centre parties that support it, said the reform of the country's unemployment agency would be postponed by one year and would be based on a different legal framework.
The move is in line with demands made by the opposition Moderates and Christian Democrats who had threatened to join forces with the Sweden Democrats and Left Party in a vote of no confidence in Labour Market Minister Eva Nordmark.
The ultimatum, which had some leading Social Democrats raising the risk of the government resigning, was awkward for Lofven as it hit at a reform agreed by him and his centre-right supporters in what is called the January Agreement that ended months of deadlock in forming a government after inconclusive 2018 elections.
""The January agreement stands firm,"" Lofven and leaders of the Greens, Liberals and Centre wrote in a signed article in Swedish daily Aftonbladet.
""The reform of the unemployment agency is a big and important reform that requires the support of parliament. In order to make that possible, we have agreed to the changes we are now presenting,"" they added."

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Nairobi's governor pleaded not guilty to corruption and other economic crimes involving millions of dollars in a Kenyan court on Monday.
Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko was arrested on Friday and is accused of conspiracy to commit corruption, failure to comply with laws related to procurement, unlawful acquisition of public property and laundering the proceeds of crime.
Chief public prosecutor Noordin Haji has accused Sonko and his associates of the misappropriation of 357 million Kenyan shillings ($3.52 million).
Kenyans and investors have long complained of corruption in Kenya, East Africa's business hub and the region's richest economy. President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to crack down on the problem. 
Sonko appeared before anti-corruption chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti dressed in a designer shirt sequined with a gold teddy bear under a hooded camouflaged jacket.
Police set up barriers on streets around the court and diverted traffic in anticipation of possible trouble after Sonko's supporters called for protests. 
Sonko, a member of Kenyatta's ruling Jubilee Party, said in a statement on Sunday that his arrest was politically motivated and that he was a law-abiding citizen.
He urged his supporters to avoid any actions that ""may threaten the peace"".
""What I ask of you, my supporters, is to pray for me. Even all my haters, please pray for me,"" the statement, written partly in English and partly in KiSwahili, read. 
Sonko was represented in court by a high profile team of Kenyan lawyers including the Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen.
The former senator is a flamboyant figure, known for his glitzy lifestyle, flashy clothes, chunky gold jewellery and eye-catching hairstyles. 

Police used teargas to disperse hundreds of Sonko's supporters when he was called into the anti-corruption office for questioning in November.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in New Delhi have arrested the owner and manager at a factory where 43 people perished in the Indian capital's deadliest fire in 20 years, a spokesman said on Monday.
The blaze started early Sunday morning when more than a hundred workers were sleeping in the four-storey building located in a residential part of Delhi.
The factory, which made school bags and toys according to Indian media, was packed with combustible materials like paper, plastic and cardboard, causing it to burn for hours before being brought under control.
""We have arrested the owner and a manager of the factory where the fire broke out, and initiated an investigation which is going to be completed soon,"" Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi police spokesman, told Reuters.
Most workers employed at the unit used to live in the factory itself, cooking meals there. The Indian Express quoted one of the victims who had telephoned a neighbor in his hometown in central India saying he was trapped and going to die soon and that he should take care of his family. 
Fire engines had struggled to access the congested lane where the building was located, witnesses said. 
Frequent raids by civic authorities to enforce building codes, fire safety measures and evacuation procedures have failed to curb violations in the rapidly expanding city of around 20 million people.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced compensation of 1 million rupees ($13,933) for the families of those killed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson will travel to the heartlands of Brexit Britain in a final campaign blitz ahead of Thursday's election, as he seeks to secure the parliamentary majority he needs to take the country out of the European Union.
""We have just three days to make that a reality, three days to break the deadlock and avoid a hung parliament ... three days to get Brexit done,"" he will say on Monday during a visit to Sunderland in the northeast of England.
The city was one of the first places to declare its residents had voted for Brexit after a referendum in 2016.
While Johnson has made the Dec. 12 election chiefly about ending the tortuous path to divorce from the bloc, his main rival, the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn, has focused on promises of sweeping economic steps to benefit struggling Britons.
Labour will pledge on Monday to begin delivering its plans to end public spending cuts and begin nationalizing industries within 100 days of taking office.
Johnson is ahead in opinion polls and forecast to win the 320 or so parliamentary seats he needs to finalize the EU divorce by Jan. 31. But, with many areas expected to be very tight contests, even a small change in public opinion could cost him an outright majority.
That would lead to a hung parliament that many expect to result in a temporary government led by Corbyn. This would mean the Labour leader had limited powers to enact his economic reforms, but would see smaller parties coalesce behind holding a second Brexit referendum.
Labour, which would need a huge last-minute swing in public opinion to claim a majority of its own, has promised to negotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU and then to give voters a choice between leaving under that deal or staying in the bloc.
Corbyn's campaign has centered on appealing to voters who are frustrated after almost a decade of spending cuts by successive Conservative-led governments.
Labour is offering more public spending paid for by higher taxes on companies and the wealthy, hundreds of billions of pounds of infrastructure investment funded through borrowing, and a program of nationalization.
""When we win power it will be to give it to you,"" Labour's would-be finance minister John McDonnell will say during a speech on Monday."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Frustrated by what it sees as a lack of flexibility by the United States, North Korea has set a year-end deadline for Washington to change its policies or leader Kim Jong Un may embark on a ""new path"".
Talks over the future of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenals are stalled despite two years of efforts and three unprecedented meetings between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump.
What exactly Kim's new path may be is unclear, and there is little direct insight into the thinking of the North Korean leader and his inner circle beyond a steady stream of state media reports warning that the deadline should not be ignored.
Reuters spoke to North Korea watchers from around the world for insight into what Kim might do in the new year. Responses have been edited for length.
CHRISTOPHER GREEN, LECTURER AT LEIDEN UNIVERSITY IN THE NETHERLANDS
""The odds are on an aggressive turn, but it does rather depend how events unfold between now and the end of the year. The meeting (of ruling party leaders later this month) might conclude with faux-regret that the Party must now shift resources back to military development. They might well decide that what everyone's diary for 2020 really needs is a North Korean satellite launch. But on the other hand, if there is movement in talks with the United States, they might also seek a pretext to overturn their ultimatum. At the moment, but not for much longer, the script of the meeting is amenable to change.""
JENNY TOWN, MANAGING EDITOR OF STIMSON CENTER'S 38 NORTH WEBSITE
""It would not be surprising to see something big, like an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) test or a satellite launch even before the end of the year. On the other hand, North Korea does run the risk of losing support from China and Russia if they take too provocative of measure, which would not serve their larger goal of continued economic development well. So, depending on what they understand to be redlines for China and Moscow, they may still refrain from such things as nuclear weapons tests to be able to preserve the cooperative arrangements they’ve been able to cultivate.""
CHO TAE-YONG, SOUTH KOREAN FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND VICE FOREIGN MINISTER
""There are largely three options – nuclear test, missile test, and conventional provocation. Nuclear testing and ICBM launch carry high risks as Trump would now no longer be able to brag about how there has not been major tests, and either of that would result in another United Nations Security Council resolution, and especially nuclear test would bring Chinese backlash. They could perhaps go conventional, such as a military provocation in the West Sea against South Korea, but that may not work for Trump or others. Therefore North Korea is more likely to opt for a missile test, it could be an submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) or an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) or a long-range one that can be masked as a satellite launch.""
EVANS REVERE, A FORMER U.S. NEGOTIATOR WITH NORTH KOREA
""While we can't completely rule out the possibility of a nuclear test or an ICBM test-launch, either of these two actions would be viewed as highly provocative and dangerous by the United States and others.  At the top of my list of possible North Korean actions are a 'satellite launch' or an IRBM test flight over Japan and into the North Pacific. Kim Jong Un may have reason to believe that the United States' reaction will be as muted in this event as it has been in response to other recent ballistic missile tests.""
ARTYOM LUKIN, PROFESSOR AT FAR EASTERN FEDERAL UNIVERSITY IN VLADIVOSTOK
""I remember a conversation that I had last June with a visiting North Korean official who pointedly asked what would be Russia’s response if North Korea gets no sanctions relief from the U.S. and makes 'a strong move.' I answered him that Moscow would essentially follow China in its reaction to Pyongyang's possible escalation. I still stand by this assessment. The most intriguing question is whether Pyongyang got a nod from Beijing to escalate against the U.S. We have no way to know. But I presume that Beijing would not mind if Kim launches a long-range missile. A nuclear test is another matter – I don’t think China will be happy if North Korea resumes nuclear explosions.""
RACHEL MINYOUNG LEE, SENIOR ANALYST AT NK NEWS
""Kim Jong Un at the plenum (may) announce a policy shift that would likely include 'undoing' some of the decisions made at the April 2018 plenum, starting with the moratorium on ICBM and nuclear testing. North Korea could conduct a test, either on the day of the plenum or in the next couple days, to show its resolve. I think it will start with something smaller, perhaps a medium-range missile, a satellite, or another SLBM, and work its way up next year. I think a return to byungjin (policy of simultaneously developing the military and economy), or some version of it, is likely... because of the subtler but important state media signaling over the past four months.
YANG XIYU, SENIOR FELLOW AT CHINA INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
""This new path is about self-reliance, self development of their economy and not relying on foreign countries. The other part is to develop their rockets. The recent continual launching of missiles is actually a prediction or a warning. Before they said they would work through dialogue to remove the sanctions against them and then develop their economy. However, if now there is no hope of resolving sanctions through dialogue, then it’s back to self-reliance."""
837,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 01:07AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why have North Korea-U.S. denuclearization talks stalled?,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Negotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have been at a standstill after a working-level meeting with the United States in October in Stockholm collapsed. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has set a year-end deadline for Washington to change its stance in the negotiations, a deadline U.S. officials have downplayed as artificial. 
North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, meanwhile, says denuclearization is now off the table.
Here are the competing demands that lead to the deadlock: 
HOSTILE POLICY
A North Korean envoy accused U.S. officials of sticking to their ""old viewpoint and attitude"" when he broke off the Stockholm talks.
Little was known about what North Korea and the United States specifically sought and offered during that meeting. 
But Pyongyang has been demanding U.S. corresponding action to its proposed dismantling of a nuclear testing venue, including the lifting of crippling sanctions.
North Korea offered to abolish its Yongbyon nuclear complex in return for the revocation of key five U.N. resolutions during a failed summit between Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in February in Vietnam.
But the Americans argued decommissioning Yongbyon did not suffice, calling for Pyongyang to transfer nuclear weapons and bomb fuel to the United States.
North Korea had also said it dismantled its Sohae missile launch site as an initial step toward denuclearization, but the facility was used on Sunday for what Pyongyang said was a ""very significant test"".
North Korea has stepped up calls for the United States to an end to joint military drills with South Korea, as well as retracting its ""hostile policy"" including criticizing Pyongyang's human rights record. 
'COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE, IRREVERSIBLE'
U.S. officials came to Stockholm seeking a ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization"" of North Korea, and pushed for a moratorium on weapons tests as a first step, a diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
Although some media reports said the United States had planned to propose temporarily lifting sanctions on coal and textile exports, the source said the Stockholm talks did not get into details.
Washington and Seoul have contemplated possible areas where sanctions be eased on the conditions they can be immediately put back if needed, such as a resumption of South Korean tours to the North. 
North Korea, in contrast, has sought a ""systematic guarantee"" for the lifting of sanctions, singling out five U.N. resolutions at the Hanoi summit, the source said. 
The five U.N. resolutions, adopted in 2016 and 2017, chiefly limited North Korea's mineral exports and banned financial transactions, which were expected to prevent Pyongyang from earning at least $1 billion a year. 
""But the Americans can't take the risk of easing sanctions first, having already given a lot of gifts to Kim without substantial progress on denuclearization, including summits,"" the source said. 
""Sanctions are basically all they have to press North Korea.""
U.S. negotiators tried to fix a date for the next round of talks when the Stockholm meeting fell apart, but North Korean officials were uncooperative, the source said.
DEADLINE 
As the year-end deadline approaches, North Korea has ratcheted up tensions, firing dozens of missiles and warning Kim might take a different path if diplomacy with the United States fails. 
Kim was ""displeased"" at Trump's remarks Tuesday he could use military force against North Korea ""if we have to"", a top North Korean commander said on Wednesday, warning of ""prompt corresponding actions"".
Trump's re-election battle and the impeachment inquiry against him may have emboldened Kim to overestimate North Korea's leverage, the diplomatic source said. 
Recent weapons tests raised concerns North Korea could resume nuclear and long-range missile testing suspended since 2017. Analysts described last month's launch of shorter range weapons as a Thanksgiving reminder for Trump. 
""North Korea is pushing the envelope little by little with the tests, and the Americans are saying if those tests were not a big deal, but they're not OK,"" the source said.

""If there's no progress until year-end, North Korea would have to do something, maybe an intercontinental ballistic missile test. Then the United States has no option but to respond even more sternly, and in a worst-case scenario, the negotiations could break down for good.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thousands of firefighters burned grassland in eastern Australia on Monday in a desperate bid to starve an anticipated new front of bushfires of fuel before forecast searing temperatures on Tuesday.
More than 100 fires are ablaze in New South Wales and Victoria states, many of which have been burning for several weeks and including a single blaze that stretches more than 60 km (37.2 miles) in a national park north of Sydney.
Conditions are expected to worsen from Tuesday, when temperatures are forecast to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and winds are expected to start picking up.
""We are expecting to see across large geographic areas high fire dangers,"" Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney.
""Firefighters are doing kilometers and kilometers of back burning operations, containment line establishment and consolidation.""
Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November.
Bushfires are common in Australia's hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry.
Stoked by strong winds, several fires have combined into a single massive blaze that is threatening the region of Hawkesbury, about 50 km north west of Sydney.
Authorities have warned the blaze is unlikely to be extinguished until meaningful rain arrives - which is not expected for at least three months - and forecasts indicate the fire could be pushed towards larger population areas.
""The big danger is if the winds come from the west and that's exactly what is forecast,"" Hawkesbury City Mayor Barry Calvert told Reuters. ""People are trying to clear their gutters, clean up the leaves on the ground, anything they can do to keep their properties safe.""
Calvert said many locals were struggling to move animals and livestock in an area renowned for breeding racehorses.
""We've opened the showground for people to move their animals, but many people here may have 20 horses and only two horse boxes so they can't move them quickly,"" Calvert told Reuters. 
The wildfires have blanketed Sydney - home to more than 5 million people - in smoke and ash for more than two weeks, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and prompting commuters to wear breathing masks. 
The city, usually known for its sea breezes, clear skies and beach-dotted coastline, has made several appearances in the top ten lists of the most polluted cities in the world. Severe water restrictions begin in the harbor city on Tuesday.

Australia's worst bushfires on record destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria state in February 2009, killing 173 people and injuring 414.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Volunteers in the New Zealand city of Rotorua are preparing two dozen white-lined coffins to be transported to Samoa at the end of the week as the measles-ravaged Pacific island nation languishes under a growing death toll that has now hit 70. 
The smallest of the coffins, designed for the bodies of babies, are decorated with felt butterflies, daisies, stars and hearts. Volunteers have placed a teddy bear in each of the infant-sized caskets.
""It's not easy. No-one is prepared to lose that many children,"" said Tagaloa Tusani, a New Zealand-based volunteer who is organizing the coffin transport. 
""No funeral home is prepared for that.""
The highly infectious disease has attacked Samoa's most vulnerable, with 61 out of the 70 casualties aged four and under, the government said on Monday.
After causing devastation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine, among others, measles cases started appearing en masse earlier this year in the New Zealand city of Auckland, a hub for travel to and from small Pacific islands.
The virus then took hold in Samoa which had the lowest vaccination rates in the region. 
There are now almost 4,700 reported cases of measles in Samoa's island population of only 200,000.
The World Health Organization (WHO) last week described the global epidemic as ""an outrage"" given most deaths have been in children under five years old who had not been vaccinated.
""The fact that any child dies from a vaccine-preventable disease like measles is frankly an outrage and a collective failure to protect the world's most vulnerable children,"" said the WHO's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus.
Supported by foreign governments and international aid agencies, Samoa has been conducting a vaccination drive that the government said has now covered nearly 90% of eligible people.
There are currently 16 critically ill children in intensive care in Samoa, and two pregnant women are also in hospital.
International groups have been sending medical supplies to Samoa, and providing doctors and nurses, to help combat the disease. 
The volunteers in Rotorua, located south-east of Auckland, usually make coffins for New Zealand families who can't afford them.
Volunteer coffin-maker Ron Wattam said he never imagined they'd be catering for an epidemic of this magnitude.
""The caskets are white, and white-lined inside, all made up to very suitable undertaker standards,"" said Wattam.

""It's the least we can do.""

PENSACOLA, Fla. (Reuters) - Investigators believe a Saudi Air Force lieutenant acted alone when he killed three people and wounded eight at a U.S. Navy base in Pensacola, Florida, before being fatally shot by a deputy sheriff, the FBI said on Sunday.
But they have yet to determine a motive for the rampage, even though fellow Saudi students at the base who were close to the shooter are cooperating with investigators, said Rachel Rojas, special agent in charge of the FBI's Jacksonville office and lead investigator on the case.
Rojas said the FBI was working, as it does in most mass shootings, on the presumption that it was an act of terrorism, but she stressed that was largely to allow investigators to use special tools afforded to them in terrorism cases.
""We are looking very hard at uncovering his motive and I would ask for patience so we can get this right,"" she said, adding that 80 FBI special agents, 100 support staff and scores of other investigators from the Navy and multiple federal agencies were working the case.
The FBI identified the shooter as Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21, and said he opened fire inside a classroom at the base early on Friday morning. 
Rojas said the pistol he used - a Glock 9mm handgun that can be paired with a magazine holding 33 rounds - was legally purchased by the shooter somewhere in Florida. According to U.S. regulations, it is legal for a foreigner in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa to buy a gun if certain conditions are met - including if they simply have a hunting license. 
Alshamrani was on the base as part of a U.S. Navy training program designed to foster links with foreign allies. He had started training in the United States in 2017 and had been in the Pensacola area for the past 18 months, authorities said. 
His fellow Saudi students were speaking directly with American investigators and were restricted to the base on order of the Saudi military, Rojas said.
""I thank the kingdom for their pledge of full and complete cooperation,"" she added. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman were ""devastated"" by what took place and pledged to help families of the victims.
The Saudi crown prince called Trump on Sunday to assure him Saudi authorities would offer their absolute cooperation with the United States and provide all information that would help the investigations, the Saudi state news agency reported.
But members of Congress representing Florida have blasted the U.S. government for not already labeling the shooting as a terrorist attack and have demanded more details about what the Saudi government is doing to help the investigation and prevent future violence by members of its military.
The attack comes as the Trump administration has maintained warm ties with Riyadh amid Saudi involvement in the war in Yemen, high tensions with Middle East rival Iran, and continued political fallout from the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year at a Saudi consulate in Turkey.
A group that tracks online extremism has said Alshamrani appeared to have posted criticism of U.S. wars in predominantly Muslim countries and quoted slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on Twitter hours before the shooting spree.
In English, he also wrote that he hated the American people for ""committing crimes not only against Muslims but also humanity,"" and he criticized Washington's support for Israel, according to analysis by the SITE Intelligence Group.
Reuters has not verified the authenticity of the account, @M&MD_SHAMRANI, which was suspended by Twitter on Friday.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, speaking at a Sunday afternoon press conference, answered ""yes, yes"" when asked if he considered the shooting an act of terrorism.
""There is a lot of frustration in our state over this,"" DeSantis said. ""You have foreign military personnel coming to our base. They should not be doing that if they hate our country.""
DeSantis said Alshamrani took advantage of a ""federal loophole"" to buy the gun he used, and he confirmed that the suspect, since arriving in the United States in 2017, made a return trip to Saudi Arabia and also recently visited New York. The governor declined to give further details. 
""He had a deep-seated hatred for the United States,"" DeSantis said. ""For us to be bringing in these foreign nationals, you have to take precautions. Bringing in people from Saudi Arabia - we need to be on guard against that."" 
Alshamrani was one of about 200 foreigners at the Pensacola base and thousands around the United States who participate in military training, a program that U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said was ""very important to our national security.""
Esper told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he had asked top defense officials to make sure all necessary precautions were taken to ensure safety at military installations, and that he asked the Pentagon to review screening procedures for military personnel from other countries coming to the United States for training.

Those personnel were already screened by the departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security, Esper said.

LONDON/KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine will ask the British Supreme Court on Monday not to force it to pay billions of dollars in debt to Russia without a trial that would determine whether Kiev was forced to borrow the money under duress.
The case, being decided in London because the debt was structured as a Eurobond under English law, could see British courts rule on some of the most contentious issues in the Russia-Ukraine feud that has divided Moscow from the West.
The debt was borrowed six years ago by a pro-Russian president months before he was toppled in a popular uprising. Moscow is seeking a summary judgment in its favor that could see Ukraine ordered to pay the debt in full, without a trial.
Ukraine argues that it should not be forced to pay without having a chance to challenge the debt, a position backed by an appeals court in a ruling that Russia now wants the Supreme Court to overturn.
Alex Gerbi, a partner at the firm representing Kiev in the case, said Ukraine would argue that the debt was incurred under duress.
""Russia should have to prove its claim, and justify its conduct, in the full public scrutiny of an English trial,” Gerbi said.
Ukraine has accused Russia of applying “massive, unlawful and illegitimate economic and political pressure to Ukraine in 2013”, forcing the country to accept Moscow’s financial support instead of striking up closer ties with the EU, according to earlier court documents.
Moscow has not commented on the case. A source familiar with the Russian position said Russia would argue that Ukraine's case has no merit and no trial is needed.
The $3 billion bond was borrowed by Ukraine in the final months of the administration of President Viktor Yanukovich, a supporter of close relations with Moscow who was toppled in a public uprising after abandoning a deal on ties with the EU.
Russia responded to Yanukovich's fall by seizing Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and backing separatists in eastern Ukraine in a war which has killed more than 13,000 people. The United States and European Union responded to those Russian moves with sanctions against Moscow which have yet to be lifted.
Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is scheduled to meet Russia's Vladimir Putin on Monday to push for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Both countries are also due to renew a gas transit deal -- a regular source of disagreement between them -- by the end of December.
The Eurobond matured in December 2015 and has not been repaid. Moscow wants payment in full, including interest which could push the debt beyond $4 billion. Kiev says Russia should have participated in a 2015 restructuring of its Eurobonds.
The case is one of two major court cases this month being watched by international investors in Ukraine. Hearings are due to begin in Kiev on Dec. 19 in the case of the nationalization of Ukraine's largest commercial bank."

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's transportation minister Sanna Marin was selected by her Social Democratic party on Sunday to become the country's youngest prime minister ever, taking over after the resignation of Antti Rinne.
The 34-year-old Marin, whose party is the largest in a five-member governing coalition, will be the world's youngest serving prime minister when she takes office in the coming days.
Rinne resigned on Tuesday after a party in the coalition, the Centre Party, said it had lost confidence in him following his handling of a postal strike.
""We have a lot of work ahead to rebuild trust,"" Marin told reporters after winning a narrow vote among the party leadership. Antti Lindtman, head of the party's parliamentary group, was runner up.
Marin has had a swift rise in Finnish politics since becoming head of the city council of her industrial hometown of Tampere at the age of 27.
She will take over in the middle of a 3-day wave of strikes, which will halt production at some of Finland's largest companies from Monday. The Confederation of Finnish Industries estimates the strikes will cost the companies a combined 500 million euros ($550 million) in lost revenue.
The centre-left coalition, which took office just six months ago, has agreed to continue with its political program stressing a shift to carbon neutrality, after Rinne announced he was stepping down at the demand of the Centre Party.
""We have a joint government program which glues the coalition together,"" Marin said.

The timing of the change in leadership is awkward for Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union until the end of the year, playing a central role in efforts to hammer out a new budget for the bloc.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2019 02:37PM ET</span>","Don't cede too much for peace at Paris talks, Ukrainians tell president","KIEV (Reuters) - Thousands of people gathered in the center of Kiev on Sunday to send a message to Ukraine's president, who meets his Russian counterpart on Monday, that Ukrainians will not accept a peace deal at the cost of the country's independence and sovereignty.
""We are here because we are not satisfied with the peace at any costs ... the peace at the costs of capitulation,"" Inna Sovsun, a lawmaker of opposition Golos (Voice) party, told the rally.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin are meeting in Paris alongside the French and German leaders in a renewed effort to end a conflict between Ukrainian troops and Russia-backed forces in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014. 
Zelenskiy, who won a landslide election victory in April promising to bring peace, said this week that his first face-to-face meeting with the Russian president would give Kiev a chance to resolve the more than five-year-old war in the Donbass region.
But many Ukrainians are concerned over a possible compromise with Russia, which they see as an aggressor seeking to restore the Kremlin's influence on the former Soviet republic and ruin Ukraine's aspiration to closer European ties.
The Ukrainian government wants to agree with Moscow on a sustainable ceasefire in Donbass, the exchange of all prisoners, and a timeline for the withdrawal of all illegal armed forces from regions under the control of Russia-backed separatists. 
The leaders' meeting was arranged after Ukraine and separatists withdrew their military forces from three settlements in Donbass - implementing agreements reached between Russian, Ukrainian and separatist negotiators in September. 
Kiev also promised to grant a special status to territory controlled by the rebels and to hold elections there.
These plans, seen as a sign of Kiev's capitulation, sparked protests in the Ukrainian capital.. 
According to an opinion poll of Ukrainians conducted by a think-tank Democratic Initiative and Kiev's International Institute of the Sociology on Nov 4-19, 53.2% of respondents are against a special status for Donbass and 62.7% do not accept an amnesty for those who fight against the Ukrainian army. 
""We are here so that the voice from Kiev can be heard in Paris. Friends, we cannot make any concessions to Putin until the last sliver of Ukrainian land is free,"" ex-president Petro Poroshenko told Sunday's rally.
Relations between two countries collapsed following pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovich's escape to Russia and Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, which prompted Western sanctions on Russia. 
Historian Volodymyr Vyatrovych said many centuries and recent years of Ukrainian history showed Kiev should not believe in a good will of Moscow.

""Zelenskiy's new team seems to be returning to this erroneous strategy, which consists in the fact that we can agree with Russia,"" he told the rally.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2019 12:16PM ET</span>",Merkel's party blasts SPD before coalition talks,"By Madeline Chambers
BERLIN (Reuters) - The leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives sharply criticized attempts by the Social Democrats (SPD) to push their ruling coalition to the left, accusing her partners of thinking of themselves more than Germany.
The parties will decide in the next few weeks whether their centrist alliance has a future after the SPD chose a more leftist leadership duo, who have demanded new policies on climate, investment and the minimum wage.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a Merkel protege and head of her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), attacked the SPD for failing to commit to the coalition but stopped short of ruling out all their demands.
""Just like you can't be a little bit pregnant, you can't rule a little bit,"" she told Bild am Sonntag, saying the CDU was true to the coalition deal and she expected the same of the SPD.
""This coalition is for the country, not trauma therapy for ruling parties,"" she told the weekly.
Her comments set the stage for a tense start to talks on the coalition, though most commentators think the parties may be able to reach agreement on some at least some policies. Initial meetings are likely to start this week.
A collapse of the 18-month-old alliance could lead to a minority government or snap election, threatening instability in Europe's biggest economy at a time when many fear the strength of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Merkel, who has led Germany for the past 14 years, has said she will not stand for a fifth term.
LOOMING CONFLICTS
Investment is one potential area of conflict, with the SPD's new leaders having said they want to spend about 450 billion euros ($496 billion) on infrastructure over 10 years.
Though the party did not insist the government drop a commitment to achieving a balanced budget without incurring new debt, it has demanded more flexibility, which Kramp-Karrenbauer appeared to rule out.
""There is no point in making new debt,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, adding that the problem is not the money but bottlenecks in allocating funds.
Kramp-Karrenbauer also rejected SPD calls to raise the minimum wage, arguing that an independent commission rather than politicians should decide on the matter.
On climate policy Kramp-Karrenbauer said she did not want to start afresh after the government had only in September agreed a complex package aimed at ensuring Germany will meet targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, there may be some room for maneuver, not least because the Greens are blocking legislation in the upper house. 
While the SPD made relatively modest coalition demands, delegates at the party's conference agreed a more leftist agenda for its future approach to benefits, tax and the budget. The election of popular youth wing leader Kevin Kuehnert as one of its deputy leaders also marked a shift to the left.
Markus Blume, General Secretary of Bavaria's conservatives, rejected any notion of the government embracing the SPD's ideas.

""An SPD on a leftist path will not lead to the German government following a leftist path,"" he told Welt am Sonntag.

Hariri quit as prime minister on Oct. 29, prompted by mass protests against an entire political class blamed for state corruption and steering Lebanon into the worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war.
Under the country's power sharing system, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim. Hariri has continued to govern in a caretaker capacity until a new prime minister is named.
After Hariri quit, talks to agree a new cabinet became mired in divisions between Hariri, who is aligned with Western and Gulf Arab states, and adversaries including the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah. Last month Hariri officially withdrew his candidacy to be prime minister. 
A consensus on Khatib appeared to form last week among the main parties, including Hariri. But Khatib failed to win enough backing from the Sunni Muslim establishment for the position.
Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Latif Derian, Lebanon's most senior Sunni cleric, told Khatib during a meeting on Sunday that he backed Hariri, Khatib said after the meeting.
""I learned ... that as a result of meetings and consultations and contacts with the sons of the (Sunni) Islamic sect, agreement was reached on nominating Saad al-Hariri to form the coming government,"" Khatib said.
Khatib later went to see Hariri at his Beirut residence where he announced the withdrawal of his candidacy.
There was no immediate statement from Hariri.
Formal consultations to designate the new prime minister have been scheduled for Monday at the presidential palace. President Michel Aoun must designate the candidate with the greatest level of support among Lebanon's 128 lawmakers.
Political sources said it was not immediately clear if the consultations would go ahead as planned.
But if they did, it would now seem logical for lawmakers in Hariri's Future Movement to nominate him again, Future Movement official Mustafa Alloush told Reuters, noting the absence of any other candidate.
In recent days, in his role as caretaker prime minister, Hariri appealed to friendly foreign states to help Lebanon secure credit lines for essential imports as the country grapples with a hard currency shortage.
He has said he would return as prime minister only if he could lead a government of specialist ministers which he believes would satisfy protesters and be best placed to deal with the economic crisis and attract foreign aid.

But this demand has been rejected by groups including Hezbollah and its ally Aoun, a Maronite Christian. Both say the government must include politicians.

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un risks losing ""everything"" if he resumes hostility and his country must denuclearize, after the North said it had carried out a ""successful test of great significance.""
""Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way. He signed a strong Denuclearization Agreement with me in Singapore,"" Trump said on Twitter, referring to his first summit with Kim in Singapore in 2018.
""He does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November,"" he said.
North Korea's state media KCNA reported earlier on Sunday that it had carried out a ""very important"" test at its Sohae satellite launch site, a rocket-testing ground that U.S. officials once said North Korea had promised to close.
The reported test comes ahead of a year-end deadline North Korea has imposed for the United States to drop its insistence on unilateral denuclearization. Pyongyang has warned it could take a ""new path"" amid the stalled talks with the United States.
""North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has tremendous economic potential, but it must denuclearize as promised,"" Trump said on Twitter.
The KCNA report called it a ""successful test of great significance"" but did not specify what was tested.
Missile experts said it appeared likely the North Koreans had conducted a static test of a rocket engine, rather than a missile launch.
""If it is indeed a static engine test for a new solid or liquid fuel missile, it is yet another loud signal that the door for diplomacy is quickly slamming, if it isn’t already,"" said Vipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States.
""This could be a very credible signal of what might await the world after the New Year.""
Tensions have risen ahead of a year-end deadline set by North Korea, which has called on the United States to change its policy of insisting on Pyongyang's unilateral denuclearization and demanded relief from punishing sanctions.
On Saturday North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations said denuclearization was now off the negotiating table with the United States and lengthy talks with Washington are not needed. 
""The results of the recent important test will have an important effect on changing the strategic position of the DPRK once again in the near future,"" KCNA reported, using the initials of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
RETURN TO CHARGED RHETORIC
Recent days have also seen a return to the highly charged rhetoric that raised fears of war two years ago.
In 2017, Trump and Kim famously engaged in a war of words, with Trump calling Kim ""Rocket Man"" and North Korea calling Trump, now 73, a ""dotard.""
On Tuesday, Trump once again called Kim ""Rocket Man"" and said the United States reserved the right to use military force against North Korea. Pyongyang, in response, said any repeat of such language would represent ""the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.""
The test is the latest in a string of statements and actions from North Korea designed to underscore the seriousness of its year-end deadline.
North Korea has announced it would convene a rare gathering of top ruling-party officials later this month, and on Wednesday state media showed photos of Kim taking a second symbolic horse ride on the country's sacred Mt. Paektu.
Such meetings and propaganda blitzes often come ahead of major announcements from North Korean authorities.
While North Korea has not specified what its ""new path"" could be, observers have suggested the launch of a space satellite is a possibility, allowing Pyongyang to demonstrate and test its rocket capabilities without resorting to overt military provocation such as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch.
Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean Navy officer who teaches at Kyungnam University in Seoul, said North Korea may have tested a solid fuel rocket engine, which could allow North Korea to field ICBMs that are easier to hide and faster to deploy.
""North Korea has already entered the ‘new path’ that they talked about,"" he said.
'REVERSIBLE STEPS'
Trump told reporters in June 2018 after his first summit with Kim that North Korea had pledged to dismantle one of its missile installations, which U.S. officials later identified as Sohae.
Shortly after that summit, analysts said satellite imagery showed some key facilities at Sohae being dismantled.
However, in the wake of the second summit between Trump and Kim earlier this year, which ended with no agreement, new imagery indicated the North Koreans were rebuilding the site.

""Remember this is at the site that was supposedly dismantled as a 'denuclearization step,'"" Narang said. ""So this is a first step at 'renuclearizing.' Reversible steps are being...reversed.""

RIYADH (Reuters) - Restaurants in Saudi Arabia will no longer need to maintain entrances segregated by sex, the authorities said on Sunday, further eroding some of the world's strictest social rules as sweeping reforms take hold.
Previously, Saudi Arabia required all restaurants to have one entrance for families and women, and another for men on their own. The ministry of municipalities and rural affairs announced on Twitter this would no longer be mandatory. 
Unrelated men and women have for decades been barred from mixing in public places under strict social rules once enforced by hardline clerics and the religious police.
But Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has brought the religious establishment to heel -- partly by arresting critics -- and eased other restrictions, including bans on women driving and public entertainment.
Segregation has quietly eased over the past year or so, as eateries, cafes, conference centers and concert halls stopped strictly enforcing it.
A spokesman for the ministry contacted by Reuters did not specify whether segregated seating areas inside restaurants would also be eliminated. The new rules are not compulsory, meaning restaurants could still maintain separate entrances if owners choose to do so, he said.
There was no announcement of changes to other public establishments, such as schools and hospitals, which appear likely to remain segregated for now.
Saudi Arabia, one of the world's most gender-segregated nations, has also been chipping away at a guardianship system which requires all women have a male relative's approval for important decisions, though some key restrictions remain.
Social openness has been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent that has seen the arrests of dozens of clerics, intellectuals and activists, including women who had campaigned for some of the freedoms that have lately been granted.
It has also raised concerns about a possible backlash by conservatives, though there has so far been little concrete pushback.
The crown prince, 34, is the heir to the Saudi throne and de facto ruler. If and when he replaces his father, King Salman, he would be the first Saudi monarch from a new generation after a succession of six brothers that have ruled since 1953.

Prince Mohammed's reputation in the West as a bold reformer suffered after the murder of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed by Saudi agents last year inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.

Esper said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he had asked top defense officials to ""make sure we're taking all necessary precautions"" to make sure military installations were secure.
Esper said he had asked the Pentagon to ""review what our screening procedures are"" before soldiers from other countries come to the United States for training. He described those programs as ""very important to our national security.""

Esper also said the ""only way forward"" for the long-running war in Afghanistan ""is through a political agreement"" with the Taliban and the Afghan government. And he said the United States had reached a point in the Middle East that ""we have deterred Iranian bad behavior.""

The Vatican said the 62-year-old archbishop of Manila will move to Rome to become head of the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, which oversees the Roman Catholic Church's work in many developing countries.
Tagle, who is popular at home and around the Catholic world, has been mentioned in the past as a potential candidate for the papacy, including in the conclave that elected Francis in 2013.
By moving him to the Vatican, Francis gives Tagle the chance to gain experience at the heart of the Church's central administration, which would round out his qualifications as a future candidate for the papacy.
Tagle, a progressive who sees eye-to-eye with Francis on social issues from poverty to immigration, has already had decades of pastoral experience as a priest, as bishop of the Philippine city of Imus and later as archbishop of Manila.

About 80 percent of Filipinos are Catholic, the highest proportion in Asia.

Transport systems were paralyzed for a fourth day on Sunday as unions at state railway SNCF and Paris public transport system RATP extended their strike against the changes.
""I am determined to take this pension reform to its completion and ... I will address people's concerns about it,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told Le Journal du Dimanche. 
""If we do not implement a thorough, serious and progressive reform today, someone else will do one tomorrow, but really brutally,"" he told the weekly publication.
Philippe has said he would present a detailed outline of the pension reform plan on Wednesday. 
Deputy Environment Minister Emmanuel Wargon told radio France Info the government would be flexible about both the timeline and implementation of the reforms.
""Timelines may be relaxed if necessary and we may differentiate how each special pension system converges with the new system under different deadlines and terms,"" she said. 
She said a date would be set to implement the new system but people's pension rights would be calculated proportionally based on how much time they had worked under the new and old systems. 
""Some say that everybody will lose under the new system. Not everybody will lose. It will be rather positive for a significant part of French citizens,"" she said. 
Philippe Martinez, the leader of the CGT union, said the CGT would fight until the government dropped the plan.
""We will continue until the plan is withdrawn,"" he told the JDD, saying the prime minister should ""go back to square one.""
France has one of the most generous pension systems among countries in the OECD grouping of industrialized nations.
President Emmanuel Macron was elected in 2017 on a platform to liberalize the economy and reform the pension system. 
Macron wants to introduce a pension system with equal rights for everyone and to do away with a set of sub-systems under which some workers at SNCF, RATP and other institutions can retire in their early fifties, a decade ahead of others. 

Unions plan a second demonstration on Tuesday, after a Thursday's first protest attracted 65,000 people in Paris and 806,000 nationwide, according to police figures.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2019 08:26AM ET</span>",Johnson pledges transformative Brexit as nerves are rattled by UK polls,"By William James and Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was nervous about his narrowing lead in opinion polls ahead of Thursday's election but pledged to deliver a ""transformative"" Brexit that will allow lower immigration.
The Dec. 12 election will decide the fate of Brexit and the world's fifth-largest economy with a stark choice between Johnson's pro-market Conservatives and the socialist-led opposition Labour Party.
""Brexit is the most radical and profound change to the management of this country,"" Johnson told Sky, adding that he would lead the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Jan. 31 if he wins a majority in the 650-seat parliament.
""Brexit is indispensable - you can't move forward without Brexit,"" said Johnson, the face of the leave campaign in the 2016 referendum before winning the top job in July after Prime Minister Theresa May failed to deliver Brexit on time.
Johnson called the snap election after more than three years of political crisis over the United Kingdom's most significant geopolitical move since World War Two. 
Voting takes place from 0700 and 2200 GMT on Thursday, with Johnson likely to need more than 320 seats to ensure he can remain prime minister and ratify the Brexit deal he struck with the EU in October.
Opinion polls put Johnson ahead of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, though his lead has narrowed in recent weeks and such polls largely failed to predict the 2016 referendum result or May's loss of her majority in the 2017 snap election.
Asked if he was nervous about narrowing polls, Johnson said: ""Of course, we are fighting for every vote. I think that this is a critical moment for this country.""
Four opinion polls published on Saturday put the lead of Johnson's Conservative Party over the Labour Party at between eight and 15 points.
The Conservatives are certainly in pole position, but not necessarily so far ahead that they're guaranteed to win, polling expert John Curtice told the BBC.
KREMLIN SHADOW?
With the United Kingdom still split over Brexit, the election has largely been dominated by rhetoric over the EU exit and an array of expensive spending promises on public services by both major parties.
Beyond Brexit, the main foreign policy issue has been Corbyn's claim that Johnson would sell off the much-cherished National Health Service (NHS) to U.S. corporations in a post-Brexit deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Johnson has repeatedly denied that claim and Trump last week said he wouldn't want the NHS if it was offered on a silver platter, but Corbyn has used leaked British-U.S. trade documents to argue that Johnson is a threat to the NHS.
The leak of the classified documents online is tied to a previous Russian disinformation campaign, social media site Reddit said on Friday, fuelling fears that Moscow is seeking to interfere in the British election.
The Kremlin, which says the West is gripped by anti-Russian hysteria, has denied it meddles in Western democracies.
The UK government said it is looking into the matter with support from the National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency.
No major poll predicts victory for Corbyn, a socialist who wants to bring swathes of the British economy into state ownership, but Labour could yet lead a minority government given that few other parties are willing to prop up a Johnson government. 
Labour proposes negotiating a new deal and then holding another EU referendum.
Johnson dodged a question on whether he would resign if he failed to win a majority and dismissed questions suggesting that, after nearly a decade of Conservative rule, he was offering voters little beyond Brexit.
Echoing the Leave campaign pledges of 2016, Johnson promised lower immigration with a Australian-style points system. 

When asked by Sky what the naughtiest thing he was ready to confess, Johnson initially asked advisers for suggestions before saying: ""When I was riding a bicycle every day, which I used to do, I may sometimes have not always have obeyed the law about cycling on the pavement.""

853,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2019 08:13AM ET</span>",Britain investigating whether leaked trade papers were hacked: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - British cyber security officials are investigating whether classified UK-U.S. trade documents that were shared online ahead of Thursday's election were acquired by hacking or were leaked, two sources told Reuters.
Beside the fears that Russia could be meddling in another Western election, the disclosure of the classified documents has raised questions about the security of sensitive discussions between the United States and one of its closest allies.
Britain's opposition Labour Party seized on the documents, saying they showed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives were plotting to sell off parts of the state-run National Health Service (NHS) in trade talks with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Johnson has repeatedly denied that claim while Trump, who in July said the NHS would be on the table in trade talks, said last week he would not be interested in the health service even if it was offered to him by Britain on a ""silver platter"".
Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency, is helping the government to investigate how the documents got into the public domain. It declined to comment on the investigation.
Two sources told Reuters that one of the lines of inquiry was to determine whether or not the documents had been hacked.
""There are clearly indicators to suggest there is more than carelessness or a disgruntled individual behind this,"" said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive national security nature of the investigation.
A third source said the investigation was looking at whether the documents were leaked from inside the United Kingdom.
Reuters on Dec. 2 reported that the way the documents were first shared on social media site Reddit and then promoted online closely resembled a disinformation campaign uncovered earlier this year.
Reddit said on Friday that the leak was tied to a previous Russian disinformation campaign.
The Kremlin, which says the West is gripped by anti-Russian hysteria, has denied it meddles in Western democracies."
854,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2019 08:01AM ET</span>",Four dead after rock collapse at South African gold mine,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Four mineworkers were killed and one was seriously injured after a rock fall at a South African gold mine on Friday trapped five workers underground, the company and a mining union said on Sunday.
The collapse at the Village Main Reef's Tau Lekoa gold mine in North West province followed at least one earth tremor.
The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) was strongly critical of the mining company, saying in a statement that ""there was no escape route in the working area where the four mineworkers were found dead"".
The union also said in the statement the mine's proto team - a group of workers trained to perform underground rescues - did not act quickly enough to save the four miners and ""deliberately stopped the team leaders and winch drivers from rescuing the four mineworkers.""
It did not give evidence for this but said it had been briefed by members working at the mine and present during the incident.
The mining firm, Village Main Reef, said it would not comment on the evacuation procedures until after an investigation was completed.
""There were two seismic events and then a rock fall occurred,"" said James Duncan, a spokesman for the mine.
""Investigations on the causal factors are ongoing and we will be able to comment only once those are complete. We won't be commenting at all on the accusations by NUM.""
NUM spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu said the rock collapse followed a ""seismic event of 2.6 magnitude"".
The death toll in South Africa’s mines fell to 81 fatalities last year from 90 in 2017, the Mineral Resources Ministry said in March. This was a marked reduction from previous decades when the sector was marked by lax safety regulations and labor laws."

Officials have not given figures for the oil price and export volumes used in the calculations, although the IMF has indicated Iran would need oil prices to be triple current levels to balance its budget as its crude exports have plunged.
The United States reimposed sanctions with the aim of driving down Iranian crude sales, the Islamic Republic's main source of revenues, after Washington withdrew last year from a nuclear pact between world powers and Iran.
""This is a budget to resist sanctions ... with the least possible dependence on oil,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told parliament, according to state television.
""This budget announces to the world that despite sanctions we can manage the country,"" he said.
He gave the value of the nominally balanced draft budget at 4,845 trillion rials, equivalent to $38.8 billion at the free market exchange rate, for the Iranian year starting on March 20.
The new budget is 10% bigger than this financial year in local currency terms although its dollar value is lower due to annual inflation that is running at about 35%.
The budget forecasts revenues for oil, gas and condensates falling 40%, leaving a gap it plans to plug by using state bonds and selling state properties.
Preliminary reports by local news agencies said the budget appeared to be based on oil sales of 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day (bpd). Under U.S. sanctions, analysts estimate Iran's oil exports have tumbled to about 400,000 bpd or even lower, from more than 2.5 million bpd.
The International Monetary Fund has said Iran would need an oil price of $194.6 a barrel to balance its budget in 2020/2021 and forecast a fiscal deficit of 4.5% of gross domestic product in 2019/2020 and 5.1% in 2020/2021.
Benchmark Brent oil (LCOc1) closed at $64.38 on Friday.
Analysts have said Iran had probably been forced to sell its crude at a discount to normal levels, as it seeks to entice buyers wary of violating U.S. sanctions.
RUSSIAN LOAN
Although U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil industry have slashed the OPEC member's crude exports by more than 80%, oil product sales remain strong, generating nearly $500 million a month, shipping data and Reuters calculations showed in September.
Unlike Iranian crude, which has distinct characteristics that mean its origin can be traced, the source of refined and other oil products are more difficult to identify.
Rouhani said Iran hoped a $5 billion loan which Iran had requested from Russia for development projects would be finalised during the budget year. 
Rouhani said Iran would continue to subsidize basic goods and medicine in the budget, based at an exchange rate of 42,000 rials to the dollar, compared to the free market rate of 125,000 rials. Using the lower exchange rates makes them more affordable to ordinary Iranians who have complained of surging prices.
Iran's move to reduce subsidies on gasoline by raising prices by as much as 200% in November led to nationwide protests which quickly turned political as young and working-class protesters demanded clerical leaders step down. 
A separate draft budget for state companies, institutions and banks allocates them a total of 14,839 trillion rials.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar leader and Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi departed on Sunday for the U.N.’s top court in The Hague to defend the country against charges of genocide of its Rohingya Muslim minority. 
Suu Kyi was pictured smiling as she walked through the airport in the nation’s capital, Naypyitaw, flanked by officials, a day after thousands rallied in the city to support her and a prayer ceremony was held in her name.
Demonstrations are planned throughout the coming week, with hearings set for Dec. 10 to 12, and several dozen supporters are also bound for The Hague, in the Netherlands, to cheer Suu Kyi on.
""I believe in Mother Suu and love her,"" said Tin Aung Thein, the organizer of a group tour, told Reuters at the airport in Yangon. ""I want (the world) to know the truth. The country has suffered a lot because of fake news.""
Gambia, a tiny, mainly Muslim West African country, filed a lawsuit in November accusing Buddhist-majority Myanmar of genocide, the most serious international crime, against its Rohingya Muslim minority.
During three days of hearings, it will ask the 16-member panel of U.N. judges at the International Criminal Court of Justice to impose “provisional measures” to protect the Rohingya before the case can be heard in full.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar in 2017 after a brutal military-led crackdown the U.N. has said was executed with “genocidal intent” and included mass killings and rape.
Despite international condemnation over the campaign, Suu Kyi, whose government has defended the campaign as a legitimate response to attacks by Rohingya militants, remains overwhelmingly popular at home.
""I believe in Mother Suu forever,"" said Zaw Htet, a former political prisoner who joined the trip to The Hague.
On Saturday, thousands rallied in Naypyitaw while senior officials held a prayer ceremony at St Mary’s Cathedral in the former capital of Yangon.
Among them was religion minister Thura Aung Ko, who was been vocal in his disdain for the minority and last year said refugees in the camps in Bangladesh were being “brainwashed” into “marching” on Buddhist-majority Myanmar.
Suu Kyi spent the eve of her departure meeting with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, with both countries pledging stronger ties, according to Zhao Lijian, deputy director general of the information department at China’s foreign ministry.
“Aung San Suu Kyi thanked China for its strong support and help in safeguarding national sovereignty, opposing foreign interference, and promoting economic and social development,” he said on Twitter on Sunday.
Pro-Suu Kyi demonstrations have been held in major towns and cities since the news was announced that she would attend the hearings in person. 

Billboards with her picture and the words “stand with Suu Kyi” have also been erected around the country, including in historic former capital Bagan, the country’s major attraction for tourists who come to see the centuries-old temples.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands of black-clad protesters from all walks of life thronged the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday in a sign of broad support for anti-government demonstrations that have roiled the Chinese-ruled city for six months.
With chants of, ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,"" anti-government activists, young and old, marched from Victoria Park in the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay to Chater Road near the heart of the financial district. 
Authorities gave the green light to Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) - organizer of largely peaceful million-strong marches in June - to hold the rally, the first time the group has been granted permission for a protest since Aug. 18.
""I will fight for freedom until I die because I am a Hong Konger,"" said June, a 40-year-old mother dressed in black seated on the grass in Victoria Park. ""Today is about standing with Hong Kong, and the international community."" 
The former British colony is governed under a ""One Country, Two Systems"" formula that guarantees freedoms not allowed in mainland China, but many fear Beijing is tightening the screws on the city and increasingly meddling in its affairs.
Beijing denies meddling, has condemned the unrest and blamed foreign governments, including the United States and former colonial power Britain, of interfering in the country's internal affairs.
Echoes of ""five demands, not one less"" echoed through the streets, referring to protesters' calls for universal suffrage in choosing the city's leader, among other demands. 
Police said earlier on Sunday they had arrested 11 people, aged 20 to 63 and seized weapons including army knives, firecrackers, 105 bullets and a semi-automatic pistol, the first seizure of a handgun in six months of protests.
Roads that would normally be jammed with traffic on a Sunday near the heart of the city were empty, as a snaking crowd that included young families, students, professionals and the elderly clogged the streets of the Asian financial hub. 
The violence in six months of demonstrations has escalated as protesters have torched vehicles and buildings, hurled petrol bombs at police, dropped debris from bridges onto traffic below and vandalized shopping malls, while police have responded with tear, gas, water cannon and, at times, live fire. 
The large turnout on Sunday signaled still broad support for the anti-government demonstrations despite the escalating unrest in a city where violence is rare. 
The protest comes two weeks after democratic candidates secured almost 90% of 452 district council seats in local elections that saw a record turnout, posing a fresh conundrum for Beijing and piling pressure on Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam.
The protests intensified in June over a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, but have now evolved into broader calls for democracy, among other demands.
In a statement on Saturday, the government appealed for calm and said it has ""learned its lesson and will humbly listen to and accept criticism."" 
Hong Kong's new police commissioner, Chris Tang, said his force would take a flexible approach to demonstrations, using ""both the hard and soft approach.""
The former British colony has been rocked by more than 900 demonstrations, processions and public meetings since June, with many ending in violent confrontations between protesters and police, who have responded at times with tear gas and rubber bullets. 
Demonstrators are angry at what they perceive are more curbs on freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the then British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
The chairman and president of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong were separately denied entry to the neighboring Chinese-ruled city of Macau on Saturday after being detained by immigration officials.
Hong Kong has enjoyed relative calm since local elections on Nov. 24 delivered an overwhelming victory to pro-democracy candidates. 

Nearly 6,000 people have been arrested in the protests since June, more than 30% aged between 21 and 25.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand will delay the deportation of the wife and children of the top commander of the Arakan Army insurgent group that is fighting Myanmar's army while authorities carry out a full investigation, Thai officials said on Sunday.
Hnin Zar Phyu, 38, the wife of Major General Tun Myat Naing, 41, their 11-year-old daughter and 11-month-old son were arrested in northern Thailand last Wednesday and charged with illegal entry after Myanmar revoked their passports.
The arrests prompted a barrage of pressure on Thailand from rights groups concerned that the family could be forced back to Myanmar in what has been an increasing pattern by Southeast Asian states to send home each other's dissidents.
""Right now we are in the investigation phase,"" Thai police deputy spokesman Krisana Pattanacharoen told Reuters.
""Whether that will lead to deportation or not, there are processes in determining if they are wanted by another country and why, but we are not at that stage yet,"" he said.
Hnin Zar Phyu and Saw Pyae Shun, 11, and Myat Lin Zan, aged 11 months, had been sent to an immigration detention center in Bangkok, he said.
Tun Myat Naing is the top commander of the Arakan Army that is fighting for greater autonomy for Rakhine state, which caught global attention after more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a crackdown by Myanmar's military in 2017.
Tens of thousands of people have fled clashes this year between Myanmar's army and the Arakan Army, an ethnic armed group that recruits mostly from Rakhine's Buddhist majority and is branded a terrorist group by the government.
Rights groups have called on the Thai government to prevent a forced return of Hnin Zar Phyu and her children to Myanmar, and raised the option of resettlement in another country.
""International pressure can mean the difference between freedom and persecution in a Myanmar jail cell. It's crucial that a government step forward and welcome all three for resettlement,"" Matthew Smith, executive director of Fortify Rights, told Reuters.
In July, Singapore authorities arrested and deported a group of Myanmar nationals with links to the Arakan Army, saying their activities caused ""security concerns""."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Firefighters in eastern Australia used easing weather conditions on Sunday to bring bushfires under control ahead of forecast of soaring temperatures for next week.
There were 96 fires burning in New South Wales, home to Australia's largest city of Sydney, with only about a half contained and more than 1,600 firefighters deployed to do back burning and create containment lines.
Sydney with its population of 5.2 million has been blanketed by unhealthy haze and smoke for weeks, with conditions worsening on Friday as several fires merged into a giant blaze that may take weeks to put out.
Australia has been through some devastating bushfires before during its hot summers, but fire officials have said that this earlier-than-usual wave of fires has been one of the most persistent and largest.
NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Australia's ABC television on Sunday that temperatures will be raising to above normal by Tuesday, reaching 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), threatening the spread of the fires and new blazes.
More smoke is to be expected around Sydney on Sunday as firefighters will do preventive work.
""Crews are going to be actively out there lighting up large tracts of land, kilometers of trails and tracks, and getting into bushland areas in an attempt to bring those fires under control and start putting it into consolidation with containment lines,"" Fitzsimmons said.
The fires have been blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson and with much of the country under a long-lasting drought, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been under pressure to address the impact of climate change.
In mid-November, 14 mayors of fire-stricken areas signed a letter urging the government to acknowledge a correlation between climate change and the devastating bushfires, asking also for more funds.
While some additional money has been provided, Morrison has repeatedly rejected any links between the fires and his conservative policies, including support for the coal industry.
On Saturday, the government issued a report suggesting that Australia is on track to meet its emission reduction target, which under the Paris Agreement calls for the country to reduce its emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030.
The government acknowledged, however, that it uses so-called carryover credits, which allow for counting emissions reduction from the past toward future targets - a practice criticized by the European Union and Pacific countries threatened by climate change."

MALACCA, Malaysia (Reuters) - Leaders of Malaysia's ruling party on Sunday renewed a push for Anwar Ibrahim to lead the country, as Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad dithers on the timing of the planned power transition he had promised to his former rival-turned-ally.
Mahathir, elected to power in May 2018, had promised to hand over the reins to Anwar, 72, soon after laying the groundwork for a new administration.
But Mahathir has said he may need more time to repair the damage left by the scandal-tainted government of his predecessor, Najib Razak, while Anwar grapples with deep-seated factionalism within his own People's Justice Party (PKR), the largest member of the ruling coalition.
""As far as I am concerned there has been clarity (that it will happen), except for the time,"" Anwar told a news conference after PKR's annual congress in Malacca, about 150 km from the country's capital Kuala Lumpur.
""But let us work out an acceptable formula so that the transition is smooth and orderly.""
Hundreds of delegates were seen holding ""Anwar PM-8"" placards at Sunday's congress, a year after he was elected the party's president. PKR was formed 20 years ago to carry on Anwar's reform agenda, after he was first jailed on what he has said were trumped-up charges of corruption and sodomy.
Anwar, who would be the country's eighth premier should he take power, has been jailed twice, receiving a second sodomy conviction in 2015. He was granted a royal pardon last May.
Last week, Anwar denied fresh allegations that he had sexually assaulted a former male aide, describing the accusation as ""politics at its worst"".
""This is not an ordinary annual conference. It is an important platform for Anwar to legitimize his position as the successor to Mahathir,"" said Adib Zalkapli, a Malaysia director with political risk consultancy Bower Group Asia.
""He won the party leadership last year. This year, Anwar has to show that he is still in control of the party.""
But on Saturday, Anwar's party deputy and perceived rival, Azmin Ali, led a walkout after delegates hit out at the president's critics for allegedly trying to destabilize the party and challenge Anwar.
Azmin denied it was a boycott of the three-day meeting, insisting that their message was for the party to focus on governance and not be hung up on the power transition.
""When the people voted us in, the people wanted us to reform...that should be the focus of the new government,"" Azmin told reporters."

PENSACOLA, Fla. (Reuters) - The Saudi airman accused of killing three people at a U.S. Navy base in Florida appeared to have posted criticism of U.S. wars and quoted slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on social media hours before the shooting spree, according to a group that tracks online extremism.
Federal investigators have not disclosed any motive behind the attack, which unfolded at dawn on Friday when the Saudi national is said to have begun firing a handgun inside a classroom at the Naval Air Station Pensacola. U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said during a public appearance on Saturday he was not ready to label it an act of terrorism.
A vigil was held on Saturday for those wounded and killed, among them a recent Naval Academy graduate who dreamed of being a fighter pilot and a teenage Arab American.
A sheriff's deputy fatally shot the gunman, authorities said, ending the second deadly attack at a U.S. military base within a week. Within hours, Saudi Arabia's King Salman had called U.S. President Donald Trump to extend his condolences and pledge his kingdom's support in the investigation.
Authorities confirmed the suspect was a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force who was on the base as part of a U.S. Navy training program designed to foster links with foreign allies. In an emailed statement on Saturday, the FBI named him as Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21.
The young officer was reported to have played videos of mass shootings at a dinner earlier in the week with other Saudi aviation students, according to U.S. media reports on Saturday that cited an unnamed person briefed on the investigation.
Investigators have found no sign Alshamrani had links to international terrorist groups and think he may have radicalized on his own, the New York Times reported, citing an unidentified U.S. official. It said the airman first entered the United States in 2018, returned to Saudi Arabia, then re-entered the United States in February, and had reported for training at the base about three days before the attack.
At least three of the eight people wounded were law enforcement officers shot as they responded to the attack, officials said, including one Navy police officer and two county sheriff's deputies. They were expected to recover.
One of the dead was identified earlier Saturday by relatives as Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23. A recent graduate of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, he had arrived at Pensacola two weeks ago for flight training, his family said.
""Joshua Kaleb Watson saved countless lives today with his own,"" Watson's brother, Adam Watson, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Friday. ""After being shot multiple times he made it outside and told the first response team where the shooter was and those details were invaluable.""
The Navy, in an emailed statement, named the other victims as Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, and Cameron Scott Walters, 21, both sailors studying at the base.
A cousin of Sameh, Hani bin Ali Moqbel, wrote on Twitter: ""God have mercy on you Mohammed, and ease your parent's pain after your loss. May you rest in heaven (We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return.)""
OTHER SAUDIS QUESTIONED
In comments to reporters at the White House on Saturday, Trump said the Saudi king and crown prince were ""devastated"" by what took place, and that the king ""will be involved in taking care of families and loved ones.""
""I think they're going to help out the families very greatly,"" Trump said.
Six other Saudi nationals were being questioned by investigators in Florida, three of whom were seen filming the incident, the New York Times reported, citing an unidentified person briefed on the investigation.
An uncle of Alshamrani, Saad bin Hantim Alshamrani, told CNN from Saudi Arabia that his nephew was ""likable and mannered towards his family and the community."" He said his nephew ""has his religion, his prayer, his honesty and commitments.""
The younger Alshamrani appeared to have posted a justification of his planned attack in English on Twitter a few hours before it began, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online Islamist extremism.
He referred to U.S. wars in Muslim countries, writing that he hated the American people for ""committing crimes not only against Muslims but also humanity,"" and criticizing Washington's support for Israel, SITE's analysis said. He also quoted bin Laden, the Saudi mastermind of the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, according to SITE.
Reuters has not verified the authenticity of the account, @M&MD_SHAMRANI, which was suspended by Twitter on Friday.
GLASS AND BLOOD
About 100 people gathered at the Olive Baptist Church for a vigil on Saturday, where Chip Simmons, chief deputy in the Escombia County Sheriff's office, recounted being one of the first on the scene, which he said was littered ""with glass and blood, with killed and wounded lying on the floors.""
""You realize in that moment that you are witnessing loss of life and hatred, but there was also heroism,"" Simmons said.
The base outside Pensacola, near Florida's border with Alabama, is a major training site for the Navy and employs about 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to its website.
On Wednesday, a U.S. sailor shot three civilians at the historic Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii, killing two of them before taking his own life.
Military personnel are normally restricted from carrying weapons on U.S. bases unless they are part of their daily duties, a policy designed to reduce the risk of suicides and accidental shootings."

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was traveling outside of Mexico City on Saturday.
Preliminary reports indicated an armed man entered a building on a small street near the palace looking to relieve himself, Mexico City police said.
After two people in the building reproached him, the man withdrew a pistol and opened fire. When police arrived, they found four people with gunshot wounds lying in the building's courtyard, and shot at the gunman. 
Paramedics found the gunman dead, along with two other people, the police said. One of three people who sustained injuries died en route to the hospital.
More than 100 police officers rapidly arrived and cordoned off the street, according to television images. 
The building sits in a narrow, pedestrian-only street that opens onto an entrance of the National Palace used daily by government staff and reporters. 
Lopez Obrador took office a year ago on pledges to run an austere government. In addition to cutting his salary by half, he shed various trappings of power, including a large force of secret-service style bodyguards. 
The leftist also turned the luxurious Los Pinos presidential residence into a cultural center and moved into the centuries-old National Palace amid the bustle of Mexico City's historic center.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2019 05:31PM ET</span>",Knife-edge? UK's Johnson ahead but polls suggest majority might be tough,"By William Schomberg and Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson is heading into Britain's election next week with a lead in opinion polls, but some of the surveys also suggest that his chance of winning a parliamentary majority could be too close to call.
Four opinion polls published on Saturday put the lead of Johnson's Conservative Party over the main opposition Labour Party at between eight and 15 points, five days before the Dec. 12 national election.
At the lowest end of that range, Johnson cannot count on winning the majority in parliament he needs to take Britain out of the European Union by Jan. 31, especially if voters choose to put aside their usual allegiances to vote tactically over Brexit.
Polling firm Savanta ComRes said Johnson's lead over Labour had shrunk to eight points from 10 in a previous poll published on Wednesday - the tightest margin of Saturday's four surveys.
Its head of politics, Chris Hopkins, said the final few days of the campaign could be crucial.
""The margins are incredibly tight,"" he said. ""The Conservative lead over Labour dropping or increasing by one or two points could be the difference between a hung parliament and a sizeable Conservative majority.""
The election pits Johnson's plan to get Brexit done next month against Labour's call for a second referendum on a new Brexit deal under its veteran socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Opinion pollsters were embarrassed by Britain's last election in 2017, when they under-estimated the size of Labour's support which cost previous prime minister Theresa May her majority and threw Brexit into chaos.
They also failed to predict the victory of the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU membership referendum.
However, one poll, published before the 2017 election, by YouGov, was more accurate in predicting the number of seats won by each party.
Known as an MRP poll - an acronym for its Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification model - it predicted 93% of results in individual constituencies correctly.
The Sunday Times said a poll by Datapraxis, also using the MRP model and based on 500,000 online interviews, predicted that Johnson would win a majority of 38 in parliament next week, down from a projection of 48 two weeks ago.
""We have never seen as many undecided voters this late in the campaign,"" Datapraxis boss Paul Hilder said. ""As many as 80-90 constituencies are still up for grabs. A much larger Conservative landslide is still possible - but so is a hung parliament.""
YouGov said last month that its MRP model suggested the Conservatives were on course for a majority of 68. YouGov will publish an updated version of the poll on Tuesday.
Best for Britain, a group that wants a second referendum to stop Brexit, said an MRP poll it commissioned showed Johnson was on course to win 345 seats in parliament - or a majority of 40 - without tactical voting, a term for when people back parties they do not usually support in an attempt to defeat others.
But tactical voting by 41,000 voters in just 36 swing seats could prevent Johnson from getting a majority, it said.
""This election is on a knife-edge,"" the group's chief executive Naomi Smith said. ""If enough remainers hold their nose and vote for the candidate with the best chance of stopping the Tories (Conservatives) in their seat we're heading for a hung parliament and a final say referendum."""

866,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2019 05:02PM ET</span>",North Korea's U.N. envoy says denuclearization off negotiating table with United States,"By Michelle Nichols and David Brunnstrom
UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations said on Saturday that denuclearization is off the negotiating table with the United States and lengthy talks with Washington are not needed, the starkest statement yet emphasizing the gulf between the two sides ahead of a year-end deadline set by Pyongyang.
U.S. President Donald Trump sought to play down a recent surge in tensions with North Korea, stressing what he said was his good relationship with its leader Kim Jong Un and saying he thought Kim wanted a deal, not to interfere in next year's U.S. presidential election.
""We'll see about North Korea. I'd be surprised if North Korea acted hostilely,"" Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving for Florida.
""He knows I have an election coming up. I don't think he wants to interfere with that, but we'll have to see ... I think he'd like to see something happen. The relationship is very good, but you know, there is certain hostility, there's no question about it.""
Trump has invested considerable time trying to persuade North Korea to give up a nuclear weapons program that has grown to threaten the United States, but progress has been scant in spite of his three meetings with Kim Jong Un.
Tensions have risen ahead of a year-end deadline set by North Korea, which has called on the United States to change its policy of insisting on Pyongyang's unilateral denuclearization and demanded relief from punishing sanctions.
Kim Jong Un has warned of an unspecified ""new path"" next year, raising fears this could mean an end to a suspension in nuclear bomb and long-range missile testing in place since 2017 that Trump has held up as a key win from his engagement efforts.
U.N. Ambassador Kim Song said in a statement the ""sustained and substantial dialogue"" sought by the United States was a ""time-saving trick"" to suit its domestic political agenda, a reference to Trump's 2020 reelection bid.
""We do not need to have lengthy talks with the U.S. now and denuclearization is already gone out of the negotiating table,"" he said.
Kim Song's comments appeared to go further than North Korea's earlier warning that discussions related to its nuclear weapons program might have to be taken off the table given Washington's refusal to offer concessions.
On Tuesday, North Korea's Foreign Ministry repeated a call for Washington to change its ""hostile policies"" and said it was up to Washington to decide what ""Christmas gift"" came at the end of the year.
Kim Song also hit out at a statement this week from EU members of the U.N. Security Council criticizing recent short range launches by North Korea, calling it a ""serious provocation"" and saying they were playing the role of ""pet dog"" of the United States.
SUMMITS, BUT LITTLE PROGRESS
Recent days have seen a return to the highly charged rhetoric that raised fears of war two years ago.
In 2017, Trump and Kim Jung Un famously engaged in a war of words, with Trump calling Kim Jong Un ""Rocket Man"" and North Korea calling Trump, now 73, a ""dotard.""
On Tuesday, Trump once again called Kim ""Rocket Man"" and said the United States reserved the right to use military force against North Korea. Pyongyang said any repeat of such language would represent ""the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.""
In spite of Trump's reprise of the Rocket Man meme, he has still expressed hope that Kim Jong Un would denuclearize. On Friday the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said the United States had not yet decided whether to have a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss North Korean human rights abuses that has angered Pyongyang.
On Friday, South Korea said Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held a half-hour phone discussion on ways to maintain diplomacy with North Korea.
It said the two leaders agreed the situation has become ""severe"" and ""dialogue momentum should be maintained to achieve prompt results from denuclearization negotiations.""
Many diplomats, analysts and U.S. officials have long doubted North Korea's willingness to negotiate away a nuclear program it has invested decades and a large proportion of limited national resources in creating.
Even so, Jenny Town of 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea project, said it was unclear how literally Kim Song's words should be taken.
""It’s an interesting choice of spokesperson. Kim Song is not directly involved in the negotiation process,"" she said. 
""These kinds of hardline messages are increasing in frequency as the deadline approaches, perhaps to try to compel a last-minute offer. Although the more they push like this, the less likely they are to get what they want.""
Town said North Korea has previously indicated a willingness to give up parts of its nuclear program as a first-phase deal, but not to discuss complete denuclearization up front. 

""The North Koreans have always preferred a step by step approach rather than negotiating everything all at once,"" Town said. ""It is possible this is what Kim Song means, since we haven’t heard anything quite so stark from those involved in the negotiations.""

867,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2019 04:36PM ET</span>",United States and Iran swap prisoners in rare act of cooperation,"By Parisa Hafezi and David Brunnstrom
DUBAI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Iran each freed a prisoner on Saturday in a rare act of cooperation between two longtime foes whose ties have worsened since President Donald Trump took office. 
Iran released Xiyue Wang, a U.S. citizen who had been held for three years on spying charges, while the United States freed Iranian Massoud Soleimani. He had been facing charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Tehran.
A senior U.S. official said Washington was hopeful that Wang's release would lead to the freeing of other Americans held in Iran and that it was a sign Tehran was willing to discuss other issues.
Wang appeared to be in good health and humor, he said.
Switzerland facilitated the swap. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met Soleimani in Zurich, state news agency IRNA said. Soleimani, who then flew to Iran, was accompanied to Switzerland by Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, according to a U.S. official.
Trump thanked Iran on Twitter for what he called a ""very fair negotiation"" that led to the exchange. He said the swap showed the United States and Iran ""can make a deal together"".
In an earlier statement, Trump thanked the Swiss government for its help in negotiating Wang's release.
""Freeing Americans held captive is of vital importance to my administration, and we will continue to work hard to bring home all our citizens wrongfully held captive overseas,"" Trump said.
Arriving in Tehran, Soleimani, a stem cell expert, told reporters the Americans who had held him were ""petty.""
""I told them that I had patients that needed my help. And they said who cares. Let them die,"" he said. ""It shows that American officials have issues with Iranians.""
IRNA reported that Wang was released based on ""Islamic clemency"".
The releases were the result of three or four weeks of intensive negotiations, the senior U.S. official said.
""We're hopeful this will lead us to further success with Iran,"" he told reporters in a conference call.
Switzerland represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran, since Washington and Tehran cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
CHARGES DROPPED
Wang, a Princeton University graduate student, was convicted on espionage charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2017. His family and the university have always said he was in Iran for research into a history degree and denied spying.
According to Princeton, he was born in Beijing in 1980, emigrated to the United States in 2001 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. His wife and child are Chinese citizens. China, which normally requires its citizens to give up their nationality when they become citizens of another country, has not commented publicly on the case.
Soleimani was arrested at Chicago airport in October 2018 over U.S. allegations he tried to export biological materials to Iran in violation of sanctions imposed by Washington because of its nuclear program.
Tensions have risen between Iran and the United States since Trump last year pulled Washington out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Tehran's economy. Iran has responded by gradually removing its commitments under the agreement.
Soleimani had been due to appear in court on Dec. 11 but the charges against him were dropped, the senior official said.
He said no ransom was paid or any other sort of concession made by the United States. He referred questions on the status of Soleimani's legal case to the Department of Justice.
""But what I can tell you in light of the status of Mr. Soleimani's case, this was an extraordinarily good outcome for the United States of America,"" the official said.
Asked about the status of Soleimani's case, a senior Department of Justice official sent Reuters an Atlanta court order showing the criminal indictment was dismissed on Saturday.
“The President made a decision in this matter based on foreign policy considerations. The Administration has effectuated this decision,” the official said in an email.
'THREE LONG YEARS'
The second U.S. official said Wang would be examined by doctors in Germany, where he was expected to stay for several days.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote on Twitter he was ""pleased that the Iranian government has been constructive in this matter.""
Hua Qu, Wang's wife, told Reuters she was ""happy.""
""Our family is complete once again,"" she said in a separate statement. ""Our son Shaofan and I have waited three long years for this day, and it’s hard to express in words how excited we are to be reunited with Xiyue.""
""We are thankful to everyone who helped make this happen.""
Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese businessman resident in the United States who was freed in June after four years in prison in Iran, told Reuters he was the first to know of the release and had told Wang's mother and wife.
""Wang's wife has got a visa to travel to Germany. Wang is expected to come to Washington, D.C., on Monday,"" said Zakka.
Washington has demanded that Iran release all the Americans it is holding, including father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi; Michael R. White, a Navy veteran imprisoned last year, and Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent missing since 2007.
""I hope, pray, and expect that this is not a one-time trade but the beginning of an expedited process that will bring my family home soon,"" Babak Namazi, Siamak's brother, said in a statement.

Several dozen Iranians are being held in U.S. prisons, many of them for breaking sanctions.

Indigenous tribes in Brazil are facing escalating violence during the presidency of Jair Bolsonario, who has promised to reduce tribal rights and encouraged the commercial exploitation of their protected lands. Tribes have faced violence especially from illegal loggers and miners.
Magno Guajajara, a spokesman for the tribe, said they did not know why the two men had been shot, whom he identified as Firmino Guajajara and Raimundo Guajajara. But the men were on a highway, coming back from a meeting, when the shooting happened.
""They were shooting at everyone,"" he said.
Authorities said they were investigating but did not say if anyone had been detained.
The incident happened in the Cana Brava indigenous reservation, which spans 137,000 hectares (338,530 acres)in the state of Marahnao and has 4,500 inhabitants, according to government records.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko were holding talks on Saturday on an integration road map in the southern Russian city of Sochi.
A lack of detail on what such a pact might include has fueled fears that Moscow aims to gain new influence in ex-Soviet Belarus as part of a plan to absorb it.
""A lot of progress has been made, even on oil and gas. The positions have come significantly closer,"" Russian Economy Minister Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Oreshkin said, without providing any detail.
Oreshkin added that the two presidents would meet again in St. Petersburg on Dec. 20.
Lukashenko, who did not address the press after the talks, last month threatened not to sign an integration deal with Russia if it failed to resolve ""oil and gas issues"".
Russia has provided energy subsidies to Belarus in the form of cheap oil and gas and low-cost loans to keep Minsk in its political orbit, but now plans to phase these out to lessen the burden on its economy.
Belarus has said that it stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year from changes to Russian tax policy and has tried to negotiate compensation. Russia says the subsidies cost its exchequer billions of dollars.
Lukashenko this week said the countries had yet to reach an agreement over compensation in a dispute over tainted Russian oil that was pumped through the Druzhba pipeline.
He said the financial losses sustained by Belarus over the contamination of oil in the Druzhba pipeline amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Belarusian leader, who has been in power since 1994, has dismissed opposition fears that a possible integration pact with Russia could end with his country losing its independence to Moscow.
He has said the two countries are not discussing deeper political ties.
Despite his assurances, some 1,000 people gathered in the Belarusian capital Minsk on Saturday to protest integration with Moscow."

Russian jets killed at least nine people in an attack that hit a market in the village of Balyoun and another four people in a strike on the village of al-Bara, the Observatory said. 
Five more people were killed in a barrel bomb attack by Syrian government helicopters on the village of Abdita, the Observatory said. Barrel bombs killed two more people in the villages of Jebghas and Tel Minis, it added.
Syrian state media carried no reports of military operations by the Syrian army or its Russian ally in those areas on Saturday.
The Observatory said eight children were among the dead.
Russia and Turkey, which backs the Syrian opposition and has troops on the ground in Idlib, brokered a ceasefire in the northwest in August but attacks have continued since then.
At least 11 people were killed in Syrian government air strikes that hit two outdoor markets on Monday, the civil defense said.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2019 10:42AM ET</span>",Rocket hits Iraqi cleric's home following deadly Baghdad attack,"By Ahmed Rasheed and Raya Jalabi
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A rocket fired from a drone targeted the home of populist Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr on Saturday, lawmakers from his Saeroon party said, following one of the capital's bloodiest nights in recent weeks.
The drone attack, which caused little damage and left no casualties, followed a deadly attack by armed men near Baghdad's main protest site on Friday night, which left at least 23 dead, police and medical sources said.
Nearly 130 others were wounded by gunfire and stabbings targeting anti-government protesters at the Sinak bridge near Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), the sources said. The death toll includes three members of the police.
Thousands of Iraqis have occupied the central square and three nearby bridges which lead to the city's Green Zone, Iraq's political center, for more than two months, calling for a complete uprooting of the political system.
Friday and Saturday's attacks came days after Iraq's prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, said he would resign. 
Sadr, a mercurial figure who has supported the protests but not thrown his full weight behind them, was in Iran at the time of the drone attack on his home in the southern holy city of Najaf, a source in his office said. 
However, a spokesman for his party said the incidents were aimed at pressuring both protesters and political leaders to accept whichever candidate is nominated for the premiership by the ruling elite.
""The Sinak massacre and the bombing of (Sadr's home) is geared at pushing the acceptance of the candidate for prime minister,"" said Jaafar Al-Mousawi.
Iranian officials including the powerful commander of its Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani, stepped in to prevent Abdul Mahdi's resignation in October, Reuters reported.
Soleimani was reported to be in Baghdad this week, negotiating with political leaders for a new consensus candidate for prime minister.
MASKED GUNMEN
The weekend's developments marked a drastic escalation to quell the demonstrations, the country's largest in decades. More than 430 people have been killed since protests began on Oct. 1.
Security sources said they could not identify the gunmen who attacked protesters on Friday night.
The incident was followed by further intimidation early on Saturday morning, as more unknown gunmen drove in a convoy down the main riverside street which leads to Tahrir Square, firing a volley of shots toward it. 
The heavily armed, masked gunmen roamed the street near Tahrir Square and attempted to advance onto it but were eventually turned around at a checkpoint manned by Iraq's security forces, witnesses said.
Friday's deadly attack came hours after Washington imposed sanctions on three Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary leaders whom it accused of directing the killing of Iraqi protesters. A senior U.S. Treasury official suggested the sanctions were timed to distance those figures from any role in forming a new government.
Western diplomats condemned the attack on protesters, urging Iraqi authorities to investigate whoever is responsible.

The government has said it would investigate and try those responsible for the violence, but there has been little evidence of real accountability, partly due to the complexity of Iraq's varied security apparatus.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2019 10:02AM ET</span>","More French protests see roads blocked, trains disrupted and scuffles in Paris","By Marine Pennetier and Geert De Clercq
PARIS (Reuters) - Truckers blocked roads in about 10 regions around France on Saturday to protest against a planned reduction in tax breaks on diesel for road transport, while train and metro services remained heavily disrupted by a strike against pension reform. 
In Paris there were scuffles with police in the Denfert Rochereau area of the residential Left Bank as several hundred ""yellow vest"" protesters continued their weekly demonstrations, but numbers were relatively small compared with previous weeks as the transport strike made it hard to reach the capital.
The combined pressure of the yellow vest movement over the cost of living and union protests against pension reform are a major challenge to President Emmanuel Macron's efforts to balance the state budget and introduce more environmentally friendly legislation in the second half of his mandate.
Truckers federation Otre (Organisation des Transporteurs Routiers Européens) said it opposed an increase in taxes on diesel for commercial vehicles as part of the government's draft 2020 budget.
""Our movement is a movement of rage against the continued fiscal punishment of road transport that we can no longer tolerate,"" Alexis Gibergues, Otre's president in the Ile-de-France region around Paris, said on LCI television. 
Gibergues said truckers were not targeting city centers for now, but that could change if the government does not respond. 
French TV showed images of trucks blocking motorways in several parts of the country including the Ile-de-France. Passenger cars were allowed to pass slowly, but many foreign trucks were forced to stop.
CHEAPER FUEL 
Truckers' organizations complain that foreign truckers can buy cheaper fuel at home, which allows them to operate more efficiently in France. 
In its draft 2020 budget, the government plans to gradually reduce tax breaks on fuel for trucks between July 1. 2020 and Jan. 1 2022. 
The measure is expected to raise about 140 million euros ($154 million) in a full year, which the government wants to use to finance new transport infrastructure. The draft law is set to get a second reading in parliament in mid-December. 
Last year, President Emmanuel Macron's centrist government dropped plans to increase taxes on fuel for passenger cars after the yellow vest movement against the plan morphed into a nationwide and often violent anti-government protest. 
Meanwhile French public transport systems were paralyzed on Thursday and Friday by a strike against planned pension reforms.
On Saturday, transport remained disrupted, with only one in 10 regional trains and one in six high-speed TGV services running. In Paris, only lines 1 and 14 - both automatic, driverless lines - were in operation. 
Air traffic was virtually normal following disruptions on Thursday and Friday.

UNNAO, India (Reuters) - A 23-year-old rape victim set on fire by a gang of men, which included her alleged rapists, has died in a New Delhi hospital, prompting protests from opposition leaders who blamed the ruling party for failing to check incidents of violence against women.
The woman was on her way to board a train in Unnao district of northern Uttar Pradesh state to attend a court hearing over her rape when she was doused with kerosene and set on fire on Thursday, according to police.
She was airlifted to New Delhi for treatment later that day.
The attack, the second major case of violence against women in the past two weeks, has sparked public outrage in India.
The woman died on Friday after suffering a cardiac arrest, Dr. Shalabh Kumar, the head of burns and plastic department at New Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital told Reuters.
""She was having 95% burns,"" he said, adding the woman's wind pipe was burned and ""toxic and hot fumes"" had filled her lungs.
The woman had filed a complaint with Unnao police in March alleging she had been raped at gun-point on December 12, 2018, police documents showed. The woman named two local men, one of them was arrested by police, the other absconded.
Having been subsequently jailed, the alleged rapist was released last week after securing bail, police officer S.K. Bhagat said in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.
On Thursday, the rape victim was seized by five men, including the two people she had named in her complaint, and beaten, stabbed and set on fire, local media reported citing her statement to police.
Still ablaze, she walked nearly a kilometer, seeking help before finally calling the police herself, according to Aaj Taj TV news channel.
All five of the accused have been arrested and are in 14-day judicial custody, Vikrant Vir, superintendent of police, Unnao, told Reuters.
A fast-track court would hear the case and the guilty would not be spared, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said.
In India, lengthy trials, often a result of fewer courts and judges, tend to delay convictions, leaving poor, disillusioned victims with little money and patience to pursue the case.
Also, long trials result in bails to the accused who often intimidate victims and their witnesses, and try tampering with evidence.
The victim's father has alleged that his family was been harassed and threatened by the family of the accused.
""We tried to seek protection as the accused and their family kept threatening my daughter and my family, but we received little help from the government,"" he said. ""Now, every single accused should be either hanged or shot dead.""
CRIME IN UTTAR PRADESH 
Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state and has become notorious for its poor record regarding crimes against women, with more than 4,200 cases of rape reported there in 2017 - the highest in the country.
Opposition leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, general secretary of India’s main opposition Congress party, accused the Uttar Pradesh government, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, of failing to curb crimes against women.
In an earlier incident in Unnao, a young woman had accused Uttar Pradesh lawmaker Kuldeep Singh Sengar of raping her in 2017. In July last year, the victim and her lawyer were critically injured in a highway collision, when a truck hit the car in which they were traveling. The woman's two aunts, who were also in the car, were killed in the accident.
Sengar denies the rape and any involvement in the car crash.
On Friday, Indian police shot dead four men who were suspected of raping and killing a 27-year-old veterinarian near Hyderabad city, drawing applause from across the country angry over violence against women.
But many were also concerned that police had over reached in shooting the alleged suspects without any trial.
""What will it take (to end rapes)? Not the encounter of just the poor men who rape but swift arrest and certain punishment of all rapists, however powerful or closely related to the victim,"" said Karuna Nundy, a lawyer practicing at India's Supreme Court who was instrumental in shaping anti-rape laws in 2013. 

""And that takes real change, it's not as easy as passing a legal amendment to increase sentencing.""

876,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2019 08:26AM ET</span>",UK minister says concerned about election interference after leak of documents linked to Russia,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - The leak of classified UK-U.S. trade documents online, tied to a previous Russian disinformation campaign, has all the hallmarks of an attempt to interfere in Britain's upcoming election, a British minister said on Saturday. 
The opposition Labour Party says the leaked documents show the ruling Conservatives are plotting to offer the state-run National Health Service (NHS) for sale in post-Brexit trade talks with Washington.
The NHS, much loved by Britons, has become a major issue in campaigning for the Dec. 12 election, polls ahead of which show Labour trailing the Conservatives. 
On Friday, social media site Reddit said it believed the documents had been leaked by a campaign that originated in Russia, fuelling fears that Moscow was seeking to interfere in Britain's election.
""I understand from what was being put on that website that those who seem to know about these things say it seems to have all the hallmarks of some form of interference,"" culture minister Nicky Morgan told BBC radio.
""If that is the case, that is extremely serious.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the truth about the leaks had not yet been established, repeating that the documents did not prove Labour's argument that U.S. President Donald Trump wanted the NHS to be included in a future trade deal. 
The government has said it is looking into the matter with support from the National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency. 
Researchers told Reuters on Monday that the way the documents were first shared on Reddit and then promoted online closely resembled a disinformation campaign uncovered earlier this year which originated in Russia.
Labour declined to comment on how the party acquired the leaked documents, saying its decision to publish them on Nov. 27 was in the public interest. The documents contain 451 pages detailing six meetings between U.S. and British officials to discuss trade and investment since July 2017. 
""We obtained those documents, we believe those documents to be correct and nobody until yesterday had denied the correctness of those documents,"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sky News.
Britain has previously accused Russia of meddling or trying to interfere in western elections, accusations repeatedly denied by Moscow. Officials in Moscow were not immediately available for comment on the latest incident. 
The British parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) has carried out an inquiry into allegations of Russian activity aimed at the United Kingdom, including in the 2016 referendum on EU membership, but Johnson declined to publish its report before the election because it needed careful study.
The government says there has been no successful attempt to meddle in British elections but critics have said Johnson sat on the report because it might contain embarrassing revelations about his Conservative Party's links.
""The prime minister has answers to give which he refuses to do about Russian donations to the Tory (Conservative) Party or the report that he is sitting on about Russian interference in British politics,"" Corbyn said.
""Of course there should be no interference in our British political system by (U.S. President) Donald Trump or the Russians.""

Britain's security agencies have warned that Russia and other countries may try to disrupt next week's election -- called by Johnson to try to break the Brexit deadlock in parliament -- with cyberattacks or divisive political messages on social media.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2019 08:05AM ET</span>",Hong Kong police chief promises flexibility ahead of rally,"By Cate Cadell and Martin Pollard
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's new police commissioner said on Saturday his force would take a flexible approach to pro-democracy demonstrations as the city gears up for a rally on Sunday that is expected to draw a huge crowd. 
Chris Tang was appointed last month upon his predecessor's retirement and amid six months of sometimes violent anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong. He was speaking in Beijing on a ""courtesy visit"" during which he briefed top officials in charge of public security, legal and Hong Kong affairs. 
""We will use both the hard and soft approach. We will be stringent on illegal violent actions such as throwing of petrol bombs, acid,"" Tang told reporters in Beijing.
""For other issues, if possible, we will adopt a more flexible approach.""
Police have given a rare green light to the demonstration planned for Sunday by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) group, which organized largely peaceful million-strong marches in the summer.
The march will gauge support for the pro-democracy movement following its overwhelming victory in local elections late last month. Police said they would intervene ""immediately"" if it turned violent.
Tang said he hoped Sunday's protest would be peaceful.
What started as demonstrations against a now-withdrawn bill allowing extradition to mainland China has morphed into calls for greater democratic freedoms and sometimes violent protests.
The international financial hub has enjoyed relative calm in the weeks since the elections.
Protesters have set out five demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation into alleged police brutality. 
Beijing has condemned the unrest and blamed foreign governments, including the United States and former colonial power Britain of interfering in the country's internal affairs. 
Tara Joseph, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told Reuters on Saturday that she had been denied entry to the neighboring Chinese-ruled territory of Macau. 
Joseph, a U.S. citizen, said she was detained by immigration authorities for around two hours as she made her way to the to the former Portuguese colony for the AmCham Macau Ball. Authorities did not give a reason for refusing her entry, she added.
FLYING FLAGS
Earlier on Saturday, police commissioner Tang observed a flag-raising ceremony in Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ), according to video footage carried by Hong Kong broadcaster Cable TV.
""I am very excited to see the country's flag fly and to feel the country's greatness,"" he told reporters. ""I would like to thank ... President Xi Jinping (for his) unwavering support of the Hong Kong police strictly enforcing the law.""
In Hong Kong, several hundred pro-Beijing supporters waved Chinese flags and played mainland hymns to show support for the government and condemn violence.
""We saw all the damages, all the wreckages, all the barricades on the roads, created by those yellow (pro-democracy) groups, the rioters, and we just couldn't stand it anymore,"" said Virginia Cheung, 54, a retired civil servant.
Xu Enlai, a 72-year old retired construction worker who moved to Hong Kong from the mainland 45 years ago, also denounced violence.

""I think Hong Kong police are doing very well ... The police are safeguarding our society here,"" he said.

Francis met Muscat and his wife and family on Saturday morning, the Vatican said, in an audience that was far more low-key than those normally held with heads of government. 
Unusually, no journalists were allowed to cover the event, which a Vatican spokesman said had been scheduled months ago.
Muscat said on Sunday he would resign as leader of the ruling Labour Party on Jan. 12 and in ""the days after"" will quit as prime minister. Opponents said he should go immediately.
A group of 22 Maltese academics sent a letter to the Vatican dated Nov. 27, before Muscat announced he would resign, urging the pope to cancel the meeting to avoid what they called a ""propaganda exercise"" in favor of Muscat.
The political stability of the tiny Mediterranean island has been rocked in recent weeks by the fallout from the 2017 murder of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was blown up by a car bomb. 

Muscat is not directly implicated in the investigation, which has made rapid progress in the last few weeks, but the self-confessed middleman in the murder plan has linked people in the premier's inner circle to attempts at a cover-up.

At a party conference on Friday, the SPD gave their new leaders, Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, a mandate to talk to Merkel's conservatives about continuing in government and set out some relatively modest policy demands.
The party is struggling to recover after weak regional and European election results and a six-month leadership campaign. Many members want to quit government - a move that could trigger a snap election or minority government.
A Forsa poll put the SPD on 11%, 3 points down from a week ago and hitting a low last seen in June after previous leader Andrea Nahles quit due following the party's worst-ever result in elections to the European Parliament.
The poll put Merkel's conservatives up 1 point at 28% and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) also up 1 point at 14%.
""Contrary to what the SPD hoped, the long search for a leader has not turned out to be a high point for democracy but rather a big let down,"" said Forsa chief Manfred Guellner.
""Voters are fed up with SPD being obsessed with itself - they want it to rule,"" he told Reuters.
The SPD's new leaders have expressed doubt about the future of the coalition but are prepared to give it a chance if the conservatives accept their demands.
Those include a boost in investment in infrastructure, introducing tougher climate protection measures and increasing the minimum wage - a more modest package than some on the SPD's left had wanted.
The conservatives have said they will not renegotiate the 2018 coalition deal but made are open to some new ideas.
Guellner said the SPD's approach was not sufficient to win over voters already lured by the Greens, on 22% in the Forsa poll, up from 8.9% in the 2017 federal vote."

Citing the passing of the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019 and the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, Yang said the United States had seriously violated international relations, and urged Washington to ""correct its mistakes"" and ""immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs"".
The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Tuesday requiring a stronger response to Beijing's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority.
U.N. experts and activists say China has detained possibly one million Uighurs in mass detention camps in Xinjiang, a region in China's far west.
China says the camps are part of an anti-terror crackdown and are providing vocational training. It denies any mistreatment of Uighurs.
The Uighur Act followed U.S. legislation recently signed into law by President Donald Trump aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong amid a crackdown on pro-democracy protests. 
What started as demonstrations against a now-withdrawn bill allowing extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China has morphed into calls for greater democratic freedoms and nearly six months of sometimes violent protests in Hong Kong. Beijing has condemned the unrest and blamed foreign interference.
Yang said U.S. officials have repeatedly made statements that distorted and attacked China's political system and domestic and foreign policies, and interfered in China's internal affairs.
""China expresses its firm opposition and strongly condemns this,"" said Yang, according to the report.

The vehicle belonging to the Medina Bus Company was attacked on a lonely stretch of road in the Kotulo area as it traveled between the towns of Wajir and Mandera.
""People, among them police officers, were brutally murdered,"" Kenyatta's office said in a statement.
Police said 10 people had been killed and that the attackers had specifically targeted non-Somalis after flagging down the bus. The area is mostly inhabited by ethnic Somali Kenyans.
""The attackers separated local Somalis from non-locals, and in the process, shot 10 non-locals dead,"" police spokesman Charles Owino said in a statement.
He said security forces were pursuing the gunmen and that the driver and conductor of the bus were in custody and helping with investigations.
Al Shabaab said it had carried out the attack and that it had killed 10 people including ""secret security agents and government employees"".
The Somali-based group has targeted Kenya many times since the East African nation sent troops across the border to fight the militants in their homeland in October 2011."

The court statement said the latest checks should take ""a limited period of time"" but gave no details on his condition.
Qaboos has no children and has not publicly appointed a successor, but he secretly recorded his choice in a sealed envelope addressed to the royal family council.

The sultanate's Basic Law says the royal family should choose a new sultan within three days of the position falling vacant. Should it fail to reach an agreement, the nation's defense council, the head of the Supreme Court and the heads of the two chambers of the consultative council would then enforce Qaboos's choice and enthrone the person he designated in the envelope.

883,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2019 01:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. says drone shot down by Russian air defenses near Libyan capital,"By Phil Stewart and Aidan Lewis
(Reuters) - The U.S. military believes that an unarmed American drone reported lost near Libya's capital last month was in fact shot down by Russian air defenses and it is demanding the return of the aircraft's wreckage, U.S. Africa Command says.
Such a shootdown would underscore Moscow's increasingly muscular role in the energy-rich nation, where Russian mercenaries are reportedly intervening on behalf of east Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar in Libya's civil war.
Haftar has sought to take the capital Tripoli, now held by Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).
U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, who leads Africa command, said he believed the operators of the air defenses at the time ""didn't know it was a U.S. remotely piloted aircraft when they fired on it.""
""But they certainly know who it belongs to now and they are refusing to return it. They say they don't know where it is but I am not buying it,"" Townsend told Reuters in a statement, without elaborating.
The U.S. assessment, which has not been previously disclosed, concludes that either Russian private military contractors or Haftar's so-called Libyan National Army were operating the air defenses at the time the drone was reported lost on Nov. 21, said Africa Command spokesman Air Force Colonel Christopher Karns.
Karns said the United States believed the air defense operators fired on the U.S. aircraft after ""mistaking it for an opposition"" drone.
An official in Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) told Reuters that Russian mercenaries appeared to be responsible.
Russian authorities deny using military contractors in any foreign military theater and say any Russian civilians who may be fighting abroad are volunteers. The LNA denies it has foreign backing.
One current and one former Russian contractor told Reuters that since September the LNA had received ground support from several hundred private military contractors from a Russian group.
Military officials linked to the GNA and Western diplomats have also confirmed the presence of Russian contractors in Libya.
TIPPING THE BALANCE
Haftar, who claims to be fighting to rid Tripoli of Islamist-leaning armed groups, has received support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, and, most recently, from Russian mercenaries, according to diplomats and Tripoli officials
Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Russians' contributions of advanced capabilities -- everything from snipers to precision weaponry -- could be felt on the battlefield, boosting the morale of Haftar's forces.
""It's giving Haftar a real technological edge,"" said Wehrey, who recently returned from Libya.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, in an interview with Reuters earlier this week, declined to comment directly on the drone but said he believed Russia was trying to ""put their finger on the scale"" in Libya's civil war to create a situation that was advantageous to Moscow.
Townsend voiced deep concern about Russia's growing role in the country, including how it would affect Libya's ""territorial sovereignty and AFRICOM's counter-terrorism mission.""
""This highlights the malign influence of Russian mercenaries acting to influence the outcome of the civil war in Libya, and who are directly responsible for the recent and sharp increase in fighting, casualties and destruction around Tripoli,"" Townsend said.
Mohammed Ali Abdallah, advisor for U.S. affairs in Libya's GNA, said the U.S. drone had come down near the pro-LNA stronghold of Tarhuna, 65km (40 miles) south-east of Tripoli.
More than 1,400 Russian mercenaries were deployed with the LNA, he said.
""Only the Russians have that ability - and they were operating where it happened,"" Abdallah said, in written comments sent to Reuters.
""It's our understanding that Haftar was asked by his Russian partners to claim responsibility, despite not having the capability or equipment to shoot down a US drone.""
More than 200 civilians have been killed and more than 128,000 displaced in the fighting since April, according to U.N. figures. "

SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held a half-hour phone discussion on ways to maintain diplomacy with North Korea, Seoul said on Saturday, as Pyongyang warns of waning patience with stalled nuclear talks.
The two leaders agreed that the situation has become ""severe"" and that ""dialogue momentum should be maintained to achieve prompt results from denuclearization negotiations,"" South Korea's presidential Blue House said in a statement.
They also agreed to consult regularly as needed, the statement said.
Tensions are rising ahead of a year-end deadline set by North Korea, which has called on the United States to change its policy of demanding unilateral denuclearization or leader Kim Jong Un may choose an unspecified ""new path"".
In a series of statements in recent weeks, senior North Korean officials have warned the United States not to ignore the deadline, and called Washington's offer of more talks a stalling tactic ahead of next year's U.S. election.
Longtime allies, the United States and South Korea are also in negotiations over how much each side will pay to fund the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.
Trump has demanded that Seoul pay as much as $4 billion more per year, according to South Korean officials, and a fourth round of talks ended in Washington on Wednesday with no agreement.

""Comfort women"" is a euphemism for the girls and women - many of them Korean - forced into prostitution at Japanese military brothels. The issue has plagued Japan's ties with South Korea for decades.
One dispatch from the consul general of Qingdao in China's Shandong province to the foreign ministry in Tokyo, says that the Imperial Army asked for one woman to accommodate every 70 soldiers, Kyodo reported late on Friday.
Another dispatch, from the consul general of Jinan, also in Shandong province, notes ""at least 500 comfort women must be concentrated here"" as the Japanese forces made further advances, Kyodo said.
The 1993 ""Kono Statement"", named after then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono in whose name it was issued, acknowledged Japanese authorities' involvement in coercing the women to work in the brothels.
But that did not stop disputes over the issue, such as the degree of involvement of the Japanese government.
""From the latest document ... we got detailed information on the operation of the brothels — how many soldiers were so-called assigned to a comfort woman,"" said Yoon Mi-hyang, head of the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.
""This is a clear sign that the Japanese government is accountable for forcefully recruiting Korean women for sexual enslavement.""
No officials were immediately available for comment at Japan's Cabinet Secretariat, which Kyodo said collects official documents concerning comfort women.
South Korea reached a settlement with Japan to resolve the comfort women dispute in 2015, in which Japan apologized to victims and provided 1 billion yen ($9 million) to a fund to help them.
Relations between the two East Asia neighbors have deteriorated since South Korea's top court ruled in favor of South Koreans seeking compensation from Japanese firms for wartime forced labor."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine President-elect Alberto Fernandez unveiled his cabinet and new central bank chief on Friday evening, laying out his core team days before the center-left leader takes office facing a stalled economy, rising debt fears and painful inflation.
Fernandez named Martin Guzman, 37, as economy minister, who will need to help steer debt restructuring negotiations with international creditors and the International Monetary Fund over around $100 billion in sovereign debt.
Fernandez's cabinet and key economy pick underscore a sharp shift from the austerity policies under outgoing conservative President Mauricio Macri. They also highlight a balancing act by the South American country's new leader, as he seeks to address the varied demands of his disparate Peronist coalition.
""It suggests a moderate approach by Fernandez towards the (economic) issue,"" said Gabriel Brasil, lead political analyst for Argentina at consultancy Control Risks. He added that Guzman did not represent the more ""radical"" elements in the Peronist movement.
Guzman, a young academic and protégé of Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, is a debt restructuring expert but has little hands-on experience in policy making.
""He is a young man, very prepared,"" Fernandez said on Friday evening introducing his cabinet. ""He knows very well the debt conflicts and the macroeconomic conflicts Argentina has."" 
Fernandez also named low-profile economist Miguel Angel Pesce as central bank chief. Pesce has previously criticized the orthodox approach of the central bank under Macri, who hands over power to Fernandez on Tuesday.
Vice President-elect Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a divisive former president with huge political influence in the country, was notably not present at the event where Fernandez announced his cabinet picks.
CREDITOR VIEW ON GUZMAN
Hans Humes, the head of emerging market specialist Greylock Capital Management, which is closely involved in the restructuring talks with Argentina, said he supported Guzman's appointment but acknowledged some investors had concerns.
""Wall Street seems to have some concerns about Guzman's lack of experience in politics and 'heterodox' economic views. I think these views are misplaced,"" he said.
""As far as experience, Guzman has been involved in sovereign and quasi-sovereign situations. And his views on growth rather than austerity led recoveries are spot on.""
Capital Economics, meanwhile, said in a note that while Guzman was more moderate than others, he was ""unlikely to take a market-friendly approach.""
Matias Kulfas, who previously held government and central bank positions, was named as the powerful production minister. 
Hours after the appointments were announced, the International Monetary Fund, which agreed to a $57 billion financing program with Argentina last year, congratulated Guzman, Kulfas and Pesce on their new positions. 
""We look forward to working with them,"" IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said on Twitter. 
Fernandez also named young political scientist Santiago Cafiero, heir to a historic Peronist family, as cabinet chief, and tapped former Buenos Aires governor Felipe Sola as foreign minister. 
The next agriculture minister of the major grains exporting country will be congressman Luis Basterra. 
Guillermo Nielsen, a key economic adviser to Fernandez, will be tasked with leading state oil firm YPF SA (BA:YPFD), which has important ties with multinational companies developing the country's vast Vaca Muerta shale play. 

Fernandez's cabinet will be tasked with steering Latin America's No. 3 economy back to a left-leaning Peronist agenda after four years of austere policies under outgoing Macri, who lost favor with voters amid a deep recession and inflation.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A giant blaze that has blanketed Sydney, Australia's largest city, in a hazardous smoke may take many weeks to put out, fire services said late on Friday, with the whole region fighting nearly 100 wild fires and expectations that the worst is yet to come.
While common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, bushfires have begun much earlier this season, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and suspected arson.
The most recent blaze north of Sydney, burning across 335,000 hectares, or 830,000 acres, has caused the cancellation of many outdoor weekend activities as smoke and ash have lingered over the city.
""These will take many weeks to put out - and only when we get good rain,"" the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said in a statement late on Friday.
Wildfires have killed at least four people and destroyed more than 680 homes across eastern Australia, according to authorities.
Although the heat and wind eased a bit on Saturday near Sydney, RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Australia's Sky News television that it was going to be ""another tough day for everybody involved.""
Some 2,000 firefighters have been deployed to fight 96 fires throughout the state, whose landscape has been parched by three years of drought. Only about half of the fires were contained.
""People are nervous and they have a right to be,"" Phil Koperberg, founder of the Rural Fire Service, said, according to The Sydney Herald Morning. He warned that with the forecast calling for more dry conditions and more heat, ""the worst is yet to come."""

PENSACOLA, Fla. (Reuters) - A member of the Saudi Air Force visiting the United States for military training is the suspect in a shooting that killed four people and injured eight at a U.S. Navy base in Florida on Friday, the state governor and other officials said.
The shooter was armed with a handgun and was killed by sheriff's deputies responding to the dawn incident at Naval Air Station Pensacola, the Navy and local sheriff's office said, the second deadly shooting at a U.S. military installation this week. 
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the suspect was a Saudi national attending training at the base as part of long-standing Navy program open to U.S. allies. 
""The government of Saudi Arabia needs to make things better for these victims. They are going to owe a debt here, given that this was one of their individuals,"" DeSantis said at a news conference.
U.S President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia's King Salman called him to offer condolences and sympathy to the victims.
""The King said that the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Salman condemned the shooting and said Saudi security services were working with U.S. agencies to uncover the cause.
""The perpetrator of this heinous crime does not represent the Saudi people, who count the American people as friends and allies,"" Salman said.
The FBI said it was the lead investigative agency on the incident, which played out over two floors in a classroom building at a base whose main function is training.
The first reports of an ""active shooter"" on the base reached the Escambia County sheriff's office at about 6:51 a.m. and a few minutes later a sheriff's deputy fatally shot the suspect in a classroom on the base, Sheriff David Morgan said.
The suspected shooter was Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In recent weeks, 18 naval aviators and two aircrew members from the Royal Saudi Naval Forces were training with the U.S. Navy, including a stint at Pensacola, according to a Navy press release. It was not clear if the suspected shooter was part of that delegation.
The group came under a Navy program that offers training to U.S. allies. A couple hundred foreign students are in the program, Captain Timothy Kinsella, the commander of the base, said during a news conference. 
A person familiar with the program said Saudi Air Force officers selected for military training in the United States are intensely vetted by both countries. 
The Saudi personnel are ""hand-picked"" by their military and often come from elite families, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak to a reporter.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he wanted to see whether U.S. vetting of these foreign military personnel was adequate.
""I want to make sure that we're doing our due diligence to understand: What are our procedures? Is it sufficient?"" Esper told reporters. ""Are we also screening persons coming to make sure they have their life in order, their mental health is adequate."" 
Senator Rick Scott of Florida called for a full review of U.S. military programs training foreign nationals on U.S. soil.
""We shouldn't be providing military training to people who wish to harm us,"" Scott wrote on Twitter.
Two sheriff's deputies were injured in the attack, one shot in the arm, the other in the knee, but both were expected to survive, officials said at the news conference.
Eight people were taken to Baptist Hospital for treatment, hospital spokeswoman Kathy Bowers said. 
The Pensacola base, near Florida's border with Alabama, is a major training site for the Navy and employs about 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to its website. 
Military personnel are normally restricted from carrying weapons on U.S. bases unless they are part of their daily duties. Nonetheless bases have seen deadly mass shootings before, including one in Ford Hood, Texas, in 2009 that left 13 dead and one at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013 that killed 12.

On Wednesday, a sailor shot three civilians at the historic Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii, killing two of them before taking his own life.

LONDON (Reuters) - The leak and distribution of classified UK-U.S. trade documents online is tied to a previous Russian disinformation campaign, social media site Reddit said on Friday, fuelling fears that Moscow is seeking to interfere in Britain's upcoming election.
Britain's opposition Labour Party seized on the leaked documents on Nov. 27, saying they showed the ruling Conservatives were plotting to offer the state-run National Health Service (NHS) for sale in trade talks with Washington.
The NHS is much loved by Britons and has become an important issue in the country's election campaign, in which Labour trails the Conservatives despite cutting its lead in some polls.
But researchers told Reuters on Monday that the way the documents were first shared on Reddit and then promoted online closely resembled a disinformation campaign uncovered earlier this year.
That operation -- known as Secondary Infektion -- attempted to spread false narratives across at least 30 online platforms, and stemmed from a network of social media accounts which Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said ""originated in Russia.""
""We were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK,"" Reddit said in a statement. ""We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it, and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.""
The company said it had identified and suspended 61 accounts which attempted to further promote the leaked papers.
""All of these accounts have the same shared pattern as the original Secondary Infektion group detected, causing us to believe that this was indeed tied to the original group,"" it said.
A Labour spokesman declined to comment on how the party obtained the leaked documents or ties to the Russian campaign.
""These documents reveal the plot against our NHS. And of course neither the UK nor the U.S. government have denied their authenticity,"" he said. ""Our releasing them to journalists was clearly in the public interest.""
The British government said in a statement it was ""already looking into the matter"" with support from the National Cyber Security Center, part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency.
""Online platforms should take responsibility for content posted on them, and we welcome the action Reddit have taken today,"" it said.
Britain goes to the polls next week in an election called by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to try to break the Brexit deadlock in parliament more than three years since the country voted to leave the European Union.
The country's security agencies have warned that Russia and other countries may attempt to disrupt the vote with cyberattacks or divisive political messages on social media.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied allegations of election meddling. Officials in Moscow were not immediately available for comment after hours on Friday."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Thursday established an investigation into potential foreign political interference through social media platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and WeChat.
The review comes amid heightened Australian concerns that China is seeking to interfere in Canberra's affairs, and after U.S. intelligence analysts found Russia had used social media to try and influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The bipartisan parliamentary Senate select committee was established after the ruling coalition government backed the opposition Labor Party's proposal.
""The rise of 'fake news' and misinformation campaigns present a very real and present danger to democracy not only in Australia, but across the globe,"" Labor lawmaker Penny Wong said.
""We must protect our democracy from malicious foreign actors.""
The investigation will need to report its findings by May 2022, around the time Australia will hold its next general election.
No specific national threat was mentioned, but activity suspected to have been undertaken by China has come under increasing scrutiny in Australia in recent years.
China denies seeking to sway Australia, accusing the government of adopting a ""Cold War mentality"".
Citing China directly, then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017 introduced new laws that required lobbyists working for foreign countries to register.
The legislation soured bilateral relations with China, by far Australia's largest trading partner.
In September, Reuters reported Australian intelligence determined China was responsible for a cyber-attack on its national parliament and three largest political parties. China denied it was responsible and the Australian government did not comment.
Last month, Australia's domestic spy agency said it was investigating whether China tried to install an agent in federal parliament in what Prime Minister Scott Morrison called ""deeply disturbing"" allegations aired in Australian media.

Amid a spate of cyber-attacks on its universities, Australia also last month required higher education facilities to declare financial dealings with foreign universities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two documentary film groups on Thursday filed a lawsuit challenging Trump administration rules adopted this year that require nearly all visitors to the United States to disclose social media user information from the last five years.
The U.S.-based groups, who are represented by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, argued in the suit that the surveillance chills visa applicants from engaging in constitutionally protected speech and association, deters them from traveling to the United States, and deprives U.S. audiences opportunities to engage with filmmakers from around the world.
The rules adopted in late May require disclosure of all social media handles used over the prior five years by U.S. visa applicants, including ones under pseudonyms, on 20 platforms.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it is ""strongly opposed to the U.S. Department of State’s social media registration requirements"" and supports ""the right of people to speak anonymously without fear of reprisals or retribution.""
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, names Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security acting secretary Chad Wolf. The State Department declined to comment, while DHS did not immediately comment.
The State Department has said it receives more than 14 million applicants annually. The only travelers exempted are diplomatic and official travelers. It argued in June that the rules ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""
The Doc Society and the International Documentary Association, the groups filing suit, say they regularly collaborate with non-U.S. filmmakers and warn visitors must ""consider the risk that a U.S. official will misinterpret their speech on social media, impute others’ speech to them, or subject them to additional scrutiny or delayed processing because of the views they or their contacts have expressed.""
The State Department has said the move was prompted by President Donald Trump's March 2017 order requiring heightened vetting of visa applications. It previously collected contact information, travel history, family information, and prior addresses from all visa applicants. 
Applicants must disclose accounts on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and its Instagram site, Flickr, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google+ and YouTube, LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), Myspace, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vine as well as Chinese sites Douban, QQ, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, and Youku; the Russian social network VK; the Belgian site Twoo; and the Latvian site Ask.fm. The groups said the information will be retained indefinitely.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn on Thursday unveiled a new criminal charge against singer R. Kelly, accusing him of arranging to bribe an official as part of a scheme to recruit underage girls for sex.
The 52-year-old R&B singer, known for such hits as “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Bump N’ Grind,” was arrested in Chicago in July on separate sets of charges brought by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Chicago. He has pleaded not guilty.
The new charge came in an indictment unsealed in the Brooklyn case. Prosecutors said that in 1994, Kelly caused another person to offer a bribe to an official to create a fake identification document for a person identified by the pseudonym ""Jane Doe #1.""
The indictment did not say whether the bribe was actually paid or the document created. It also did not accuse Kelly of sexually abusing Jane Doe #1.
A lawyer for Kelly could not immediately be reached for comment.
The singer, whose full name is Robert Kelly, is scheduled to go to trial in Brooklyn in May 2020. He has been jailed in Illinois since his arrest.
Kelly had denied abuse allegations for decades before the latest charges. In 2008, he was tried on child pornography charges and found not guilty.
The Brooklyn prosecutors have charged Kelly with racketeering, accusing him and his entourage of inviting women and girls backstage after concerts, keeping them from friends and family and making them dependent on him financially.
The Chicago prosecutors said Kelly had sexual contact with five minors and recorded sexually explicit videos of some of them. They also accused Kelly of obstructing justice by using threats and bribes, including payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars, to keep his victims quiet.
A trial in Chicago has been scheduled for April 27.

In addition to the two federal cases, Kelly is facing charges from state prosecutors in Illinois and Minnesota. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges as well.

Bayrou, the leader of France's centrist MoDem party, resigned as Macron's justice minister in June 2017, following a preliminary investigation into his party's finances.
Under French law, the placing of suspects under formal investigation means prosecutors believe they have ""serious or consistent evidence"" that could result in prosecution. Friday's decision puts Bayrou one step closer to trial, though the investigation can still be dropped.

ELKADER, Iowa (Reuters) - Former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned in Iowa on Friday with John Kerry, the former U.S. secretary of state and presidential nominee, seeking to bolster his case that he can set right a world turned topsy-turvy by President Donald Trump.
Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, is the most significant endorsement for Biden so far in his quest for the party's nomination to challenge Trump in the 2020 election. The two share a deep experience in global affairs, something Biden hopes will be an advantage against his Democratic rivals.
""The world is wondering what happened to America,"" Kerry told a crowd in Elkader, Iowa. 
Earlier, in Cedar Rapids, he warned ""our whole world is at risk.""
Biden, who served as Barack Obama's vice president, has argued that he is best positioned to repair traditional U.S. alliances that Trump has frayed.
Kerry served as the nation's top diplomat during Obama's second term. Biden and Kerry also served together for 24 years in the U.S. Senate, where both chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Of their working relationship, Kerry joked, ""The only team that has worked more closely than the two of us is Donald Trump and (Russian President) Vladimir Putin.""
Biden, he said, knows the ""difference between our adversaries and our allies.""
Kerry's endorsement, Biden said, ""literally means the world to me."" He praised Kerry for his role in negotiating the Paris climate accord and the nuclear deal with Iran, pacts that Trump has abandoned.
Foreign policy has been central to Biden's week as he has toured by bus though the early voting state of Iowa. His campaign cut a well-received Twitter video playing off Trump’s time at the NATO meeting in Britain, suggesting the president is a laughingstock to the rest of the world.
Also on Friday, a Super PAC supporting Biden, Unite the Country, said it would begin airing a pro-Biden ad in Iowa next week. The first Democratic nominating contest will be in Iowa on Feb. 3.
Biden, 77, has been trailing in opinion polls in Iowa behind Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The bus tour has marked his most intensive campaign effort yet in the state.
Kerry's come-from-behind win in Iowa helped propel him to the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination. He lost the general election to President George W. Bush – the last time a Republican president was elected to a second term.  
In Elkader, Biden noted that the caucuses were now fast approaching. 

""Folks, it's getting cuttin' time here,"" he said.

MAIDSTONE, England/LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn went head to head over Brexit on Friday in the last televised debate before next week's election that will determine the path for Britain's departure from the European Union.
Six days before Britain votes in its second national election in less than three years, the debate is seen as the last chance for Corbyn to squeeze Johnson's lead in the polls, which mostly point to victory for the prime minister.
The two leaders set an ill-tempered tone to the debate by battling over how to leave the EU. Johnson ridiculed Corbyn's support for a new referendum in which Corbyn has said he would remain neutral, while the Labour leader said the prime minister's pledge to ""get Brexit done"" actually meant seven years of trade talks.
More than three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, the Dec. 12 election will determine when, how and even whether Brexit happens.
""We have ample time to get on and build a new free trade partnership, not just with the EU but with countries around the world,"" Johnson said in the BBC television debate.
But Corbyn countered that it would take the government seven years to negotiate a trade deal with the United States.
Polls show Johnson's governing party is well ahead of Labour. A Panelbase survey on Friday showed the Conservatives extending their lead slightly over the opposition party to nine points, up from eight a week ago.
Johnson, who renegotiated a new divorce deal with the EU in October, has promised to ""get Brexit done"", a slogan he has repeated constantly during campaigning to try to win over Labour supporters who backed leaving the bloc, and those who are simply fed up of the political haggling over the issue.
Britons voted by 52%-48% in 2016 for Brexit but parliament has been stuck in deadlock over the way forward. If Johnson wins the majority he says he needs, Britain will leave the EU by Jan. 31 and then seek to enact a trade agreement with the bloc by the end of 2020.
DAMAGING DOSSIER
Earlier on Friday, Corbyn went on the attack, calling Johnson's promises a fraud and saying his Brexit deal would simply be the start of years of ""painful negotiations and broken promises"".
He also revealed a leaked government document which he said showed the divorce deal would lead to customs declarations and security checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, a direct contradiction to Johnson's statements that it would not create any barriers between the British province and the mainland. 
The confidential Treasury report said the impact of the deal would be higher prices and that 98% of Northern Irish exporters would struggle to bear the additional costs. 
""There will be other secret reports like this one in every government department that reveal the disastrous impact of Johnson's damaging deal,"" Corbyn said. 
Johnson said the document was ""complete nonsense"".
He has mocked the stance adopted by Corbyn, who has said a Labour government would strike another exit deal with the EU to include a customs union, and then hold a second referendum on whether Britons wanted to accept it. Corbyn has said he will be neutral in that vote.

""Have we sent out search parties to discover Jeremy Corbyn's position on the EU?"" Johnson said in a speech to supporters in southeast England. ""If you want to get this thing done, if you want to the country to move forward, you've got to vote Conservative.""

He said a Labour government boosted living standards massively after the Second World War.

Johnson said a dynamic market economy was the only way to pay for ""fantastic public services."" 

He added that uncertainty over Brexit was acting as a ""drag anchor"" on the British economy.

Federal police carried out 85 search warrants in five states as part of an investigation centered on the northern state of Roraima. They also searched the offices of a company called RBM in Sao Paulo suspected of laundering the gold prior to export, a police spokesman said.
The company, which specializes in buying precious metals, based in Caieras in the interior of Sao Paulo, did not reply to a request for comment. According to the company's website, its motto is: ""We work to transform your product into value.""
The gold originated in the indigenous Yanomami reservation in Roraima, which straddles the border with Venezuela and where the number of illegal miners has soared into the thousands since last year, the spokesman said.
By some accounts, 10,000 wildcat miners have invaded the Yanomami reservation since the election of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who said he plans to end a constitutional ban on mining on tribal lands.
Gold mined in southern Venezuela was also coming over the border, and three Venezuelan businessmen were being sought by Brazil as members of the criminal organization, the police said in a statement.
The police estimated the gold smuggled by the gang was worth more than $55 million. Several federal and state revenue officials are under investigation for helping to launder the illegal gold with documents that said it was scrap metal."

VIENNA (Reuters) - European powers demanded at talks on Friday that Iran stop violating their nuclear deal, but stopped short of triggering a mechanism that could renew U.N. sanctions and kill the 2015 accord, officials said. 
The meeting came amid heightened friction between Iran and the West. Tehran has rolled back its commitments under the 2015 deal in response to Washington's withdrawal last year and reimposition of sanctions that have crippled its economy.
With Tehran angry over a lack of European protection from U.S. sanctions, there appears scant scope for compromise. 
The Europeans and Iran clashed on Thursday over the Iranian ballistic missile program before senior diplomats from the remaining parties to the deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - met Iranian officials in Vienna on Friday to assess the state of the nuclear agreement.
As the U.S.-Iran confrontation has eroded the accord, the Europeans are torn between trying to save it and responding to Iran's breaches, which have increasingly tested their patience.
The breaches have included exceeding the maximum amount of enriched uranium it is allowed under the deal and resuming enrichment at Fordow, a plant buried inside a mountain that Iran hid from U.N. nuclear non-proliferation inspectors until Western spies exposed it in 2009.
The European ""E3"" powers - France, Britain and Germany - have been considering triggering a mechanism in the deal that could lead to reimposition of global, United Nations sanctions.
""All countries need to refrain from taking actions that further complicates the situation,"" Fu Cong, director general of the Department of Arms Control of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told reporters after the talks.
""In our view there is an element of automaticity into this and we can't be sure that countries can keep this process under control. It could aggravate tensions,"" he said, adding that the European powers had not indicated whether or when they would trigger the mechanism.
""STILL ALIVE""
A European diplomat said the E3 had stressed the need for Iran's compliance. ""The good thing is it's still alive,"" the diplomat said, highlighting the low expectations. 
Iran's top envoy to the talks, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, said that Iran would continue reducing its commitments to the deal unless it could benefit from it.
""We repeated in this meeting too that until the time solutions are found so that Iran can benefit from (the nuclear deal), Iran's process of reducing commitments will continue,"" Araqchi said, according to the official IRNA news agency.
Araqchi said that he had a ""very useful"" meeting with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi on Friday and that both sides emphasized they would continue their professional cooperation in comments broadcast on state TV.
Diplomats have said a political decision was unlikely to be made until January, when Iran is expected to further scale back its adherence to the pact, under which it curtailed its nuclear activities in return for relief from sanctions.
""The European parties to the deal should know that the clock is ticking for them. They try to keep Iran in the deal but then take no action against America's bullying and pressure,"" said a senior Iranian official.
Underlining the tension, the Iranian delegation had earlier threatened to boycott the talks after discovering that an exiled Iranian opposition group planned an anti-government protest outside the hotel where the meeting was due to take place.
Tehran has criticized the three European powers for failing to shield Iran from the far-reaching U.S. sanctions, which have driven away foreign companies interested in business there.

""I don't think the Europeans have reached their red line yet, but the repeated violations and the fact we're now entering (nuclear) proliferation territory means their credibility is on the line,"" said a Western diplomat.

Iraqi military on Thursday said that two Katyusha rockets landed inside Balad air base, which hosts U.S. forces and contractors and is located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Baghdad.
No casualties or damages were reported in the attack for which there was no immediate claim of responsibility.
""We're waiting for full evidence, but if past is prologue then there's a good chance that Iran was behind it,"" David Schenker, Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, told reporters in a briefing.
On Tuesday, five rockets landed on Ain Al-Asad air base, which hosts U.S. forces in Anbar province in western Iraq without causing any casualties.
Schenker called the increasing attacks something of ""great concern,"" and said Iran has become more aggressive over the past five to six months.
""The Iranians often times, or have certainly in the past, taken aggressive action when they feel under pressure,"" he said.
The United States ratcheted up economic sanctions against Iran after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear pact between Tehran and world powers to choke Iran's oil exports and isolate its economy.
In response, Tehran has remained defiant and rolled back commitments it made under the 2015 deal aimed at keeping Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran also has been angry over a lack of European protection from U.S. sanctions.
Some analysts have warned that cornering Tehran could make it more aggressive. Tensions in the Gulf in recent months have spiked after attacks on oil tankers and a September air strike on Saudi oil facilities, which the United States blamed on Iran, but that Tehran has denied."

BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday blacklisted three Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary leaders over their alleged role in killings of anti-government protesters in Iraq and threatened future sanctions if violence against demonstrators continued.
The sanctions announced on Friday are the latest U.S. targeting of Iraqi individuals or armed groups with close links to Tehran as Washington ramps up economic pressure to try to counter Iranian influence in the Middle East.
Washington would be ready to impose further sanctions on others over the killings of protesters if the violence did not stop, David Schenker, Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, told reporters in a briefing. 
""We are not done. This is an ongoing process,"" he said.
The sanctions target Qais al-Khazali, leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq Iran-backed militia and his brother Laith al-Khazali, another leader of the group, according to a statement from the U.S. Treasury Department.
They also target Hussein Falih al-Lami, security chief for the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), Iraq's state umbrella group of paramilitary factions, which is dominated by groups backed by Iran, including Asaib.
The Treasury Department said in its statement that groups led by the three paramilitary leaders ""opened fire on peaceful protests, killing dozens of innocent civilians."" Reuters reported last month that Lami, known also as Abu Zainab al-Lami, had directed fighters to open fire on protesters.
Iraqi paramilitary groups deny any role in the deaths of protesters, who have demonstrated against the government for more than two months. Security forces have killed more than 400 mostly unarmed protesters, police and medics say.
On Friday, gunmen killed at least six people near Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ) in central Baghdad, police and medics said.
The new sanctions also targeted Iraqi businessman Khamis al-Khanjar for alleged corruption, the statement said.
Schenker said the sanctions, which freeze any U.S. assets held by the leaders and prohibit Americans from doing business with them, are ""first and foremost symbolic"" but also have a financial impact.
Senior U.S. Treasury officials said the violent crackdown on protests was ""causing even more political instability.""
""Iraqis have a fundamental right to a political process that is free from foreign malign influence and the corruption that both comes with it and fuels it,"" one of the officials said.
They said the militia leaders had been involved in forced disappearances and abductions of activists.
Iran-backed armed groups and politicians have dominated Iraq's state institutions since a U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, plunged the country into years of civil war and destroyed infrastructure.
Iraqi protesters say the groups that dominate the government have kept people poor and jobless through corruption and failed to repair the country despite two years of relative calm after the defeat of Islamic State.
Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said last week he would quit.
Asked whether sanctions were designed to distance the militia leaders from the process of forming a new government, one of the Treasury officials said: ""The timing is quite deliberate... Iraq's people are demanding a government that is free and clear of foreign interference.""
Tension between Washington and Tehran has ramped up as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration blames Iran for a series of attacks on oil infrastructure in the Gulf and bases hosting U.S. troops in Iraq. Iran denies involvement in the attacks.
Iraqi paramilitaries have in turn accused the United States and Israel of attacks on their own installations. 

James Jeffrey, the U.S. special envoy to the global coalition fighting Islamic State, arrived in Baghdad on Thursday to meet with officials and discuss the fight against the militant group in Iraq and Syria, the State Department said in a statement on Friday.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's interim government wants Israel to help local authorities fight ""terrorism"" in the South American country, the interior minister told Reuters on Friday, alleging plots by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other leftists to destabilize regional governments.
Without providing details, Arturo Murillo said Bolivian police were investigating radical leftists allegedly linked to Maduro and drug-traffickers whom the government say had instigated deadly unrest in the country after former President Evo Morales resigned last month.
Morales had been set to finish his third term in January but had faced weeks of protests following an election that he won but which was dogged by accusations of vote rigging. He has blamed his downfall on a coup after security forces withdrew their support for him.
The interim government of President Jeanine Anez, a former opponent of Morales who was the highest-ranking official when he and his vice president fled to Mexico, has since swung Bolivia's politics sharply to the right.
She has strengthened the standing of the religious right, resumed strong ties with the United States and Israel, and sent hundreds of Cuban doctors and Venezuelan diplomats home.
Her government has also set up police units to conduct counter-terrorism operations. TV footage broadcast on local media have showed police in face masks with guns in training sessions.
""They're tough and not messing around,"" Murillo said of the units. ""We're going to keep preparing them.""
Murillo said several countries had helped train the police and that he has asked Israel for support as well.
""We've invited them to help us. They're used to dealing with terrorists. They know how to handle them,"" Murillo said of the Israelis. ""The only thing we want is to bring peace.""
Last week, the government struck a series of deals with protest leaders to ""pacify"" Bolivia after clashes between security forces and Morales' supporters killed some 30 people.
Murillo accused Maduro, a close ally of Morales, of financing unrest across the region, without providing evidence. Murillo said he plans to travel to the United States to set up ""connections"" for exchanging information.
Maduro's government has dismissed the charges as baseless.
Murillo also called it ""worrisome"" that former leftist Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was set to return to power as vice president next week.
""Unfortunately, the Argentine people elected her. That's why all of us democratic countries must be on alert,"" Murillo said."

The boat is understood to have been carrying between 150 and 180 people, who are in the process of being identified by the local authorities, said Laura Lungarotti, chief of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Mauritania.
The incidents are indicative of a resurgence in the number of people willing to risk the perilous sea passage from West Africa to Spain's Canary Islands, which was a major route for those seeking jobs and a better life in Europe until Spain stepped up patrols in the mid-2000s.
""It is part of this trend of an increasing number of people passing through this route because the central Mediterranean route has been stopped due to the Libya situation,"" Lungarotti told Reuters by phone.
The Italian government has focused on stopping migration to its shores from Libya and the Libyan coastguard has increased interceptions. With migrants detained in slave-like conditions in Libya, the numbers arriving in Italy have dropped off dramatically from a peak of 181,000 in 2016.
But the will of migrants to leave remains strong. On Wednesday, at least 62 people drowned off the Mauritanian coast and around 80 had to swim for shore after the boat carrying them northwards from Gambia sank - one of the deadliest incidents along this route in recent years."

LONDON (Reuters) - A senior British diplomat in Washington has resigned, saying she did not want to ""peddle half-truths"" over Brexit for a government she did not trust, CNN reported on Friday.
Britons head to the polls on Dec. 12 for an election which will decide the fate of Britain's exit from the European Union.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have said they will deliver Brexit by the end of January, while the opposition Labour Party, who are trailing in the polls, plans to renegotiate the exit deal and put it to another referendum.
Citing a copy of her resignation letter, dated Dec. 3, CNN reported Alexandra Hall Hall, who had been Brexit Counsellor in the British embassy in Washington since 2018, said her position had become ""unbearable personally, and untenable professionally"".
""I have been increasingly dismayed by the way in which our political leaders have tried to deliver Brexit, with reluctance to address honestly, even with our own citizens, the challenges and trade-offs which Brexit involves,"" she wrote.
""It makes our job to promote democracy and the rule of law that much harder, if we are not seen to be upholding these core values at home.""
A former British ambassador to Georgia who had worked for the foreign office for 33 years, Hall Hall said her decision to quit had nothing to do with being ""for or against Brexit, per se"".
""I am also at a stage in life where I would prefer to do something more rewarding with my time, than peddle half-truths on behalf of a government I do not trust,"" she wrote.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed Hall Hall had resigned but a spokeswoman said it would not comment on the detail of an individual's resignation.
CNN said Hall Hall's role involved explaining Britain's approach to Brexit to U.S. politicians and that she felt her diplomatic role had been co-opted to deliver messages that were ""neither fully honest nor politically impartial"".
It said she had filed a formal complaint about being asked to convey overtly partisan language on Brexit in Washington."
909,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 12:31PM ET</span>","Another day, another crisis: PM Johnson mounts defensive UK election campaign","By Elizabeth Piper
ROCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Another campaign day, another crisis for Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his quest to hold onto office and, as he repeated to an audience in southeastern England on Friday, to ""get Brexit done"" and ""get Britain out of neutral"".
Faced with accusations he has lied to the public over his Brexit deal, Johnson rubbishes the criticism, sticking firmly to his script that his ""fantastic deal"" to leave the European Union is the only one that will see the whole of Britain exit quickly.
It is part of what is a largely defensive strategy before the Dec. 12 election, in which Johnson often has to respond to accusations from his main challenger, opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, rather than setting the agenda.
Knowing that the election is the prime minister's to lose against Corbyn, who is deeply unpopular in the polls, Johnson's campaign is playing it safe - focusing on a few core messages and hoping that the criticism fails to stick.
And it seems to be working.
At a planned stop for his well-traveled campaign battle bus in the Conservative safe seat of Rochester, in southeastern England, even failing to turn up does little to dent the enthusiasm of his supporters. For many, it's just him.
Lauren, a housewife from nearby Dartford who declined to give her last name, said she believed that Johnson was a ""man of the people"", someone who would stick up for those who voted for Brexit and want it over and done with.
But, out with two friends to enjoy a Christmas market, she adds: ""When it comes down to it, there aren't any good choices ... But I think Boris probably has Britain's interests at heart more so.""
TRUST QUESTION
In an election hastily called by a prime minister who has suffered more parliament defeats than victories in his just over four months in power, there is little excitement on the campaign trail. It is more a case of trying to avoid any potentially embarrassing moments.
At the Rochester campaign stop, which was scrapped because logistics and security advice made it impossible, according to a Conservative source, a few protesters hold placards, with one saying: ""Austerity killed 130,000. The blood is on your hands.""
But the crowd is largely supportive - nearly 64 percent of voters in the area backed leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum - with many wanting someone to end the debate over Brexit.
Such warmth is to be expected. Rochester has voted for the Conservatives at the last two elections, but even in this seat, there are some who question whether the prime minister can be trusted.
""They all lie in their own way. They are politicians,"" said Lauren when asked if she believed the promises of both Johnson and Corbyn.
At a speech at the nearby Kent County show ground, the traditional home to agricultural shows, Johnson again turns the question of trust back to the delay over Brexit - most probably his strongest message in this campaign.
""On the substantive point that you make, which is about trust in politics. The issue before the country is after three-and-a-half years politicians of all parties are held in low esteem because they have refused to get on and deliver on the mandate of the people,"" he told a small audience.
""And it is utterly shameful and now is the time to do it. We have a great (Brexit) deal, it's ready to go."""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has not yet decided whether to hold a United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss human rights abuses in North Korea on Tuesday, said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft after even the prospect of such a meeting angered Pyongyang.
At least eight members of the 15-member council support a request for a meeting and the final decision rests with the United States, diplomats said. A minimum nine countries need to support the move in order to defeat any bid to block it. Between 2014 and 2017, China failed to stop the annual discussion.
Such a meeting would come at a time of increasing tensions between Washington and Pyongyang after North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un gave U.S. President Donald Trump until the end of the year to show more flexibility in talks that the U.S. hopes will lead North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs.
Kim's deadline has raised concerns among some diplomats that North Korea could next year resume nuclear and long-range missile testing that has been suspended since 2017. Trump has held up the suspension as a key achievement of his North Korea engagement.
""Human rights to me are important, I don't care where it is,"" Craft said in a news conference on Friday to mark the U.S. presidency of the Security Council for December. ""We have not made a decision on whether or not there's a Dec. 10 meeting.""
Last year, the United States dropped a push for the council to hold a meeting as it did not have enough support, diplomats said. They could have tried again in January when five new members rotated onto the council, but they did not.
On Wednesday, North Korea's U.N. ambassador Kim Song warned the council in a letter that any discussion of the country's human rights situation would be a ""serious provocation"" and Pyongyang would ""respond strongly.""
Kim Song wrote such a meeting would be an ""act of conniving at and siding with the U.S.' hostile policy, which will lead to undermining rather than helping reduction of tensions on the Korean Peninsula and resolution of the nuclear issue."" 
""I have read the letter. We care about human rights,"" Craft told reporters. ""None of us can stand by and allow ... human rights to be abused.""
North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of human rights abuses and blames sanctions for a dire humanitarian situation. Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.
A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities. The United States blacklisted Kim in 2016 for human rights abuses."

Far beneath the high politics as Russia and Ukraine prepare for talks that seem unlikely to turn a corner in the conflict between Kiev and separatists, Sidorenko and other residents of the provincial town of Ilovaisk are hoping for a breakthrough.
""Everyone is waiting, hoping they'll come together and agree, that one wonderful day this war will be over and that we'll live in peace and agreement without fear,"" she said ahead of the talks in Paris on Monday.
Over 13,000 people have been killed in the more than five-year-old conflict. There has been little sign of a peaceful solution despite a ceasefire agreement signed in February 2015 in Minsk.
Kiev accuses Moscow of waging an undeclared war in eastern Ukraine, supplying troops and heavy weapons to the Donbass region. Russia denies that and calls it a civil war.
Sidorenko's husband Konstantin Zinchik took up arms against Kiev government forces, fighting for the pro-Russian self-declared Donetsk People's Republic. He was killed at the time of the Battle of Ilovaisk in August 2014.
Hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed and more than 100 captured when Kiev's forces were surrounded and pounded with artillery fire. A ceasefire afterwards allowed a Ukrainian volunteer group, the Black Tulip, to collect the remains of Ukraine's casualties in the war.
On the rebel side, Sidorenko learned of her husband's death at the time, but did not know where his body was. It was only this year that a rebel group affiliated with the DNR learned of the location of his body and exhumed it along with three other rebel fighters."

MADRID (Reuters) - Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said on Friday the voices of climate strikers are being heard but politicians are still not taking action.
""We are getting bigger and bigger and our voices are being heard more and more, but of course that does not translate into political action,"" Thunberg told a panel in Madrid, where a U.N. climate summit is taking place.
Thunberg, who sparked a global youth-led protest movement after striking outside the Swedish parliament last year, said that asking children to skip school to protest inaction by governments on climate change was ""not a sustainable solution"".
""We don’t want to continue. We would love some action from people in power,"" she said. ""People are suffering and dying from the climate and ecological emergency today and we cannot wait any longer.""
Thunberg said she hoped the two-week annual round of climate negotiations, which opened in Madrid on Monday, would lead to ""concrete action"" and that world leaders would grasp the urgency of the climate crisis.
""Of course there is no victory, because the only thing we want to see is real action,"" Thunberg said. ""So we have achieved a lot, but if you look at it from a certain point of view we have achieved nothing."""

The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a jihadist group originally from Uganda, has killed more than 100 civilians in near-daily raids since late October when the army launched a large operation against them.
On Thursday afternoon the rebels killed 14 people in Mantumbi, a village 17 km (11 miles) west of the city of Oicha, said Donat Kibwana, administrator of Beni territory.
Earlier that day they had killed two and beheaded a third in Kolokoko, a suburb of Oicha, he told Reuters.
""Everybody has fled the village (Mantumbi). There are only soldiers here, who are in the process of helping to remove the bodies of the people who were all killed with knives,"" he said.
The U.N. says deteriorating security in the region may reverse recent progress made combating the Ebola outbreak, which has infected 3,313 and killed 2,203 people since August 2018.

Two days after a NATO summit at which alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg announced that Turkey had withdrawn its objection, allowing plans to move forward, Cavusoglu said Ankara agreed to the next step in the process but had not given final approval.
Ankara will block the plan until a defense proposal for Turkey - which Ankara says must include an endorsement of Turkey's view of the YPG by the alliance - is approved as well, he told reporters on a visit to Rome.
""That plan will not be published until our plan is published too,"" Cavusoglu said, describing Ankara's move at the summit as a gesture to its allies. ""It would not be fair for some countries to not approve our plan while at the same time backing a plan for others,"" he said.
""Both plans are waiting at the same level ... and if they are going to be published, it will be together. But, if there is a problem, then they will both be blocked. It is out of the question for there to be a compromise here.""
The YPG has formed the main fighting element of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Washington's partner in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. Ankara views the YPG as a terrorist group and has been infuriated by Western support for the militia.
Stoltenberg told reporters after the summit that allies had not discussed how to designate the YPG. Later, Erdogan told reporters in London that NATO allies must not abandon Turkey in its fight against terror after it approved the plan upon the request of the French, German, Polish leaders and Stoltenberg."

ROME (Reuters) - Almost half of Italians are in favor of having a ""strongman"" in power who does not care about parliament and elections, a survey showed on Friday, casting doubts on the strength of democracy in a major European nation.
Some 48.2% of people think the government should be led by a Messiah-like leader who does not have to worry about being accountable, the survey by Censis research institute said.
The percentage is higher among poorer and less educated segments of the population, the survey showed, reaching a peak of 67% among respondents it described as working class.
Distrust of politics in Italy has grown in recent years, with far-right parties surging in opinion polls as a chronically stagnant economy has failed to recover ground lost during the global financial crisis.
Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who ruled Italy during the 1920s and 30s, still has support among some hard-right groups, while fascist memorabilia referring to him is still sold freely in some shops and markets.
""I ask Italians to give me full powers to do what we promised to do,"" far-right League leader Matteo Salvini said in August when he pulled his party out of the ruling coalition in a failed bid to trigger an early election.
The League's former ally, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, then formed a government with the center-left Democratic Party, forcing Salvini to go into opposition.
Italy has a long tradition of political instability. Since the end of fascism its governments have lasted just over a year on average and bickering is already frequent in the new, three-month-old coalition.
Polls show the League is Italy's most popular party, with around 33% of voter support and its hard-right ally Brothers of Italy is on 10%, which means they have a good chance of winning power in the event of a snap election.
Italy's economy, the third largest in the euro zone, looks set to remain weak in the near term, the national statistics bureau ISTAT said on Friday.
The main drag on Italian economic growth is uncertainty over the future, an ISTAT official said last week, as suggested by a steep reduction in inventories which is likely to subtract 0.8 points from economic growth this year.
The Censis survey showed that for 69% of Italians ""uncertainty"" was the dominant sensation they had over the future. Just 13.8% said they were optimistic and 17.2% said they were pessimistic."

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's nationalist government plans to tighten control over theaters, in a move critics said could undermine their independence and stifle artistic freedom.
According to draft legislation seen by Reuters on Friday, the government would set up a National Cultural Council, headed by a minister, with the task of ""setting priorities and directions to be followed in Hungarian culture"".
The minister would also have a say in the appointment or sacking of theater directors at institutions that are jointly financed by the state and municipality.
""It is a fundamental requirement for activities belonging under the auspices of this law to actively defend the interests of the nation's wellbeing,"" the bill says.
Since Prime Minister Viktor Orban won power in 2010, his right-wing Fidesz party has rewritten Hungary's constitution, gained control of state media, and businessmen close to Orban and the party have built empires.
His government has often clashed with the European Union over what his critics say is a steady erosion of democratic checks and balances in the Central European country of 10 million people.
Orban has often challenged Western liberal taboos and after winning a 2018 election, his third in a row, flagged major changes ahead, claiming a ""mandate to build a new era"".
His supporters have called for an end to what they see as the dominance in Hungarian culture of leftist-liberal ideas. Orban says his election wins give him a mandate to redefine various aspects of national life.
""An era is determined by cultural trends, collective beliefs and social customs. This is now the task we are faced with: we must embed the political system in a cultural era,"" Orban said last year.
A government spokesman on Friday confirmed the government sought a greater say in the operation of theaters that it partly funds. He said a recent sexual harassment case at a Budapest theater made the changes necessary as the government currently has no power to sack the director of the theater involved.
Gergely Karacsony, a liberal sociologist elected mayor of Budapest in October in a rare setback for Fidesz, said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page the bill was a step ""in a very bad direction"".
""This proposal would eliminate cultural diversity, which stems from freedom -- which means artists are not kept on a political leash,"" Karacsony said.
The Hungarian Theatre Society also issued a statement saying the plan would curtail artistic freedoms in an unacceptable way."

Police suspect Kiska, who is now an opposition leader, of wrongdoing in campaign financing before he became president in 2014. He could face up to 12 years in prison if the case is brought to court and he is found guilty.
""The fraud is connected with entering tax receipts for the presidential election campaign into the books of (Kiska's) company although these activities were not part of the company's business,"" police said on Friday.
Kiska denies any wrongdoing.
He paid for the presidential campaign through his firm KTAG. The firm claimed a tax return worth 146,000 euros ($165,580) that was not approved by the tax authority which later imposed tens of thousands euros in additional taxes and penalties on the company.
The police looked into the company's tax records twice in the past years and did not press any charges. A third investigation was opened again this year.
The charge was made one day after Robert Fico, the leader of the biggest ruling party Smer and a former long-time prime minister, was charged with enticing racial hatred.
Kiska, an arch-rival of Fico whom he defeated in the presidential election, has long said he expected the charges as a part of a political fight against him by Fico.
""Fico continues with his revenge. I am not afraid of Fico, I have beaten him once, I will beat him again,"" Kiska said at a news conference.
Kiska now runs a new political party, Za Ludi (For the People), which has been second or third in opinion polls ahead of the Feb. 29 election.
Fico's Smer has seen its support dip but still remains the most popular party with backing of around 20%. However, it is unclear whether he or rather a group of opposition parties will be able to form a majority in parliament.
Slovakia has been shaken by the murder of an investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée in 2018, which prosecutors believe was ordered by a businessman Marian Kocner who has had strong ties with senior state officials.
He and his alleged associates will face trial from Dec. 19."

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Algerians took to the streets on Friday, making a show of strength of their last weekly protest before a presidential election next week that they have rejected as meaningless.
The protesters have been demonstrating twice a week since February to demand that the shadowy ruling elite that has controlled Algeria since independence in 1962 quits power.
On Friday, they chanted ""We will not vote"" and held aloft banners reading ""No need to prepare the polling stations"" and ""The people are fed up"" as they paraded through central Algiers.
The army, the major force within the Algerian state, sees the Dec. 12 election of a new president as the only way to restore normality after nine months of demonstrations which in April ousted the veteran leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
Protesters say any election is pointless if the ruling hierarchy, including the army, continues to wield power, and want it put off until more top officials step aside and the military quits politics.
""We will stick to our position. We don't care about next Thursday. We need change,"" said post office employee Aissa Baha’i, 32.
Later on Friday the former senior officials running for president will take part in a televised debate, Algeria's first, but the protesters dismissed it as political theater.
""We are used to hearing promises. I don't trust them,"" said Djamila Chabi, 37, referring to the debate.
Though the protest movement, which during the spring was regularly bringing hundreds of thousands of people to the streets, has so far been peaceful, there have been signs of growing tensions as the election nears.
Earlier this year the authorities detained dozens of protesters for waving flags with Berber symbols as it began to put more pressure on the marches, and later sentenced many of them to year-long prison terms for undermining national unity.
Late on Thursday, the security services accused a Berber separatist movement of planning to disrupt the election by using agents provocateurs among the protesters to incite police violence, saying a student in the banned group had confessed.
The government has also arrested several opposition figures and journalists, charging some with attacking army morale.
In recent weeks, protesters have marched more frequently and have also challenged the coming election by demonstrating against campaigning candidates and hanging bags of garbage in public spaces reserved for electioneering.
Meanwhile the government has sought to appease protester anger over corruption, arresting dozens of senior officials and former officials and businessmen, many of them associated with Bouteflika, and sentencing some to long prison terms.
On Friday, state media also reported that thousands of people had joined marches in towns in western and eastern provinces in support of Thursday's vote.
""Change cannot be made with the old system's men. This election is a waste of time,"" said university student Noureddine Kadiri, 25, marching with his two younger brothers."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has unveiled a leaked government document which shows the damaging impact of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal on Northern Ireland's economy, saying it is evidence he is misleading the public. 
Johnson has repeatedly said there would be no customs checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain under the divorce deal which he agreed with the European Union.
But the document, marked ""official, sensitive"", says exporters would have to make customs declarations when moving goods between Northern Ireland and Britain and these new barriers will be ""highly disruptive"" to Northern Ireland's economy.
The leaked analysis warns that 98% of Northern Irish exporters to Britain are small to medium sized businesses, which are ""likely to struggle to bear"" the cost of new border checks.
""This is the cold, hard evidence that categorically shows the impact Johnson's damaging Brexit deal will have on large parts of our country,"" Corbyn said in a speech in London.
Under Johnson's divorce deal, Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the EU's single market rules for trade in animal, food and manufactured goods to resolve the biggest sticking point in negotiations: how to ensure there is a seamless border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
The 500-km (300-mile) border will be the United Kingdom’s only land frontier with the EU after it leaves the bloc. The government has agreed to the arrangements for Northern Ireland to avoid erecting checkpoints that could undermine a peace deal, which ended decades of conflict in the province.
Johnson said in response to Labour's claims that there would be no custom checks on goods traveling between Britain and Northern Ireland. He said he had not seen the leaked document but described it as ""nonsense"". 
A senior government source said the document was written by a junior government official, which was not formally approved.
The Conservative Party later said that businesses which export from Britain to Northern Ireland will face some customs checks, contradicting the prime minister's claims.
Last month, Johnson told Northern Irish businesses they would not encounter additional paperwork when trading with Britain and they can put customs declarations forms in the bin.
The leaked document, however, says: ""At minimum, exit summary declarations will be required when goods are exported from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.""
The document states that new barriers could lead to higher prices in the province and that unemployment in areas like retail is likely to rise.
Labour's Brexit plan is to negotiate a new deal with the European Union to include a customs union and then hold another referendum on whether to accept it, although Corbyn himself has vowed to remain neutral.

This is the second time Corbyn has held a press conference to make public internal government documents. Last month he showed what he said was evidence that the state-run health service -- much loved in Britain -- was being discussed in trade talks with the United States.

HYDERABAD, India (Reuters) - Indian police shot dead four men on Friday who were suspected of raping and killing a 27-year-old veterinarian near Hyderabad city, an action applauded by her family and many citizens outraged over sexual violence against women.
However, some rights groups and politicians criticized the killings, saying they were concerned the judicial process had been sidestepped.
The men had been in police custody and were shot dead near the scene of last week's crime after they snatched weapons from two of the 10 policemen accompanying them, said police commissioner V.C. Sajjanar.
Thousands of Indians have protested in several cities over the past week following the veterinarian's death, the latest in a series of horrific cases of sexual assault in the country. 
The woman had left home for an appointment on her motor-scooter and later called her sister to say she had a flat tire. She said a truck driver had offered to help and that she was waiting near a toll plaza.
Police said she was abducted, raped and asphyxiated and her body was then set alight on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Four men were arrested.
Sajjanar, the police officer, said the men - two truck drivers and two truck cleaners, aged between 20 and 26 years - had been taken to the spot to help recover the victim's mobile phone and other personal belongings on Friday morning.
""As the party approached this area today (during the) early hours, all the four accused got together. They started attacking the police party with stones, sticks and other materials,"" he told reporters near the site of the shootings. 
The men, who were not handcuffed, then snatched weapons away from the police and started firing at them, but were killed after the police retaliated. He did not say how the accused were able to overpower their escorts.
""Law has done its duty, that's all I can say,"" Sajjanar said.
The National Human Rights Commission, a government-funded watchdog, said it had ordered an investigation. ""Death of four persons in alleged encounter with the police personnel when they were in their custody, is a matter of concern for the Commission,"" it said in a statement.
Indian police have frequently been accused of extra-judicial killings, called ""encounters"", especially in gangland wars in Mumbai and insurrections in the state of Punjab and in disputed Kashmir. Police officers involved in such killings were called ""encounter specialists"" and were the subject of several movies.

'LONG LIVE POLICE'
The victim's family welcomed the news the alleged perpetrators had been killed. 
""I express my gratitude towards the police & govt for this. My daughter’s soul must be at peace now,"" Reuters partner ANI quoted her father as saying.
A Reuters reporter saw the four men's bodies lying in an open field, all of them face up and barefoot, with their clothes stained with blood, surrounded by policemen.
A large crowd gathered at the site and threw flower petals at police vans in support of the action. Some shouted ""Long live police"", while others hoisted police officials onto their shoulders and burst firecrackers.
There was no immediate word from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on the incident, but Maneka Gandhi, a lawmaker from his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said the police appeared to have over-reached. 
""You can't take the law in your own hands. The courts would've ordered them (the accused) to be hanged anyway. If you're going to shoot them with guns before due process is followed, then what's the point of having courts, police and law?"" she said.
Tough laws were enacted after the 2012 gang rape and murder of a woman in a bus in New Delhi that led to an outpouring of anger across the country, but crimes against women have continued unabated.

SLOW JUSTICE
Fast track courts have been set up but cases have moved slowly, for lack of witnesses and the inability of many families to go through the long legal process. Some victims and their families have ended up being attacked for pursuing cases against powerful men, often local politicians.
Many Indians applauded the killings.
""Great work #hyderabadpolice ..we salute u,"" badminton star Saina Nehwal wrote on Twitter.
On Twitter, #encounter was the top-trending hashtag in India and No. 4 worldwide.
In Uttar Pradesh state, where a rape victim was set ablaze on Thursday while she was on her way to court, opposition politician Mayawati said the police there should take ""inspiration"" from what happened in Hyderabad.
""Culprits should be punished, and if they are not punished then whatever happened in Hyderabad should happen,"" the victim's brother said in hospital. 
She was on life support, hospital authorities said, news that could further inflame passions in a country where public anger over crimes against women has grown in recent weeks.
Indian police registered more than 32,500 cases of rape in 2017, according to the most recent government data. But courts completed only about 18,300 cases related to rape that year, leaving more than 127,800 cases pending at the end of 2017.
But some people said the lack of progress in the courts did not mean the police had a free hand to dispense justice. 

""We now have to trust that a police force that managed to let unarmed suspects escape their custody, and needed to shoot them dead because they could not catch them alive, is somehow competent enough to have identified and arrested the real culprits?,"" Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters from London.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 08:43AM ET</span>",Israel detains Palestinian Authority TV journalists in Jerusalem,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police on Friday detained four journalists from the Palestinian Authority's official television station in Jerusalem, drawing protest from Palestinians who say their activities in the holy city are increasingly restricted. 
The Palestine TV crew was filming a talk show outside of Jerusalem's walled Old City when Israeli officers detained them and took their equipment, the Authority's Wafa news service said.
The journalists with the daily ""Good Morning Jerusalem"" program were held for four hours at a police station in Jerusalem and later released, said Mohammad Barghouti, Palestine TV's general manager for news. 
Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said: ""The journalists were detained in connection with illegal activity by (the) Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem.""
Israel forbids any official activity in Jerusalem by the Western-backed PA, saying it breaches Israel's sovereignty over the city and violates interim peace agreements.
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, as capital of a future state. Israel annexed the area after capturing it in the 1967 Middle East war and says the entire city is its eternal and indivisible capital.
In November, Israel ordered the closure of Palestine TV's Jerusalem office for six months on the grounds that it was planning to stage activities for the PA, which exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank adjacent to Jerusalem. 
An office of the PA's education ministry in Jerusalem was also given a six-month closure notice in November, which Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan said at the time was ""part of a firm policy against any attempt by the (PA) to violate our sovereignty in the capital"". 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the journalists' detention as ""part of the Israeli government's scheme to entrench Israeli control over the occupied city of Jerusalem and its holy sites.""

The last round of peace talks between the two sides broke down in 2014. Palestinians have boycotted U.S. President Donald Trump's mediation efforts, partly over his recognition in 2017 of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

They have also fired at protesters as they were running away, Bachelet said in a statement, citing verified video footage.
The U.N. Human Rights Office has received information indicating that at least 208 people have been killed, including 13 women and 12 children, during the demonstrations and at least 7,000 people arrested, the statement said.
More than twice that number may have been killed, according to unconfirmed reports, according to the statement.
Iranian authorities confirmed for the first time this week that security forces killed demonstrators during what rights groups have said was the deadliest anti-government unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
""All in all, the picture now emerging from Iran is extremely disturbing,"" Bachelet said.
One of the worst incidents took place in the city of Mahshahr in southwest Iran on Nov. 18 when security forces fired at protesters with machineguns, killing at least 23 and possibly many more, the United Nations statement said.
Security forces have used water cannon, tear gas, batons, and live fire against unarmed demonstrators who posed no imminent threat of death or serious injury, it said.
""Verified video footage indicates severe violence was used against protesters, including armed members of security forces shooting from the roof of a justice department building in one city, and from helicopters in another,"" Bachelet said.
""We have also received footage which appears to show security forces shooting unarmed demonstrators from behind while they were running away, and shooting others directly in the face and vital organs – in other words shooting to kill.""
These were serious violations of human rights, Bachelet said. Iranian authorities must act with greater transparency and carry out independent investigations, including into the killing of protesters and deaths and ill-treatment in custody, she said.
""And those responsible must be held accountable,"" she said.
The senior U.S. diplomat for Iran said on Thursday that Iranian security forces may have killed more than 1,000 people,
The unrest began on Nov. 15 after the government abruptly raised fuel prices and rapidly spread to over 100 cities and towns and turned political with young and working-class protesters demanding clerical leaders step down. "

The Academy has been criticized for its choice of Handke over his support for Slobodan Milosevic, who died while in detention awaiting trial at the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague for his role in Balkan wars of the 1990s.
Handke, the author of ""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" and ""Slow Homecoming"" spoke at Milosevic's funeral in 2006.
""I am not going to participate in this year's Nobel week,"" Peter Englund said in a letter to daily Dagens Nyheter. ""To celebrate Peter Handke's Nobel Prize would be gross hypocrisy on my part.""
Englund, who headed the Academy until 2015 and remains one of its 18 members, did not immediately respond to Reuters attempts to contact him. The Swedish Academy did not immediately respond to requests for a comment.
In an email to Dagens Nyheter, Academy Permanent Secretary Mats Malm said he had no comment on Englund's decision.
Handke will hold a press conference later on Friday as part of a week of celebrations for the winners of this year's Nobels.

He will formally be given the 9 million crown ($935,000) award on Dec. 10, before attending the traditional Nobel banquet later the same day.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:53AM ET</span>","Remembrance Lake: In Japan, climate change unravels 600 years of history held dear","By Mari Saito
SUWA, Japan (Reuters) - Kiyoshi Miyasaka climbs the stone steps of his shrine, autumn leaves crunching under his feet. The Shinto priest, dressed in white, aims an orange leaf blower at a row of cobblestones and clears the path of fallen leaves.
""I know people would rather see a lone priest sweeping up with his broom,"" he says. ""But we're a bit more modern than that, and frankly, I can't get to all the leaves otherwise.""
It is an unseasonably warm November morning. The trees only changed shades a few weeks ago, and the steep hill behind the shrine looks as though it's on fire. The 69-year-old eventually puts down the roaring machine and sweeps up the lingering leaves into neat piles. Then he changes into formal robes to offer a tray of rice, sake, salt and water at the shrine's altar, and begins his prayers.
Below him, Lake Suwa looks like frosted glass, the surface mimicking ice so fragile it may crack at any moment. But the lake is far from frozen.
For nearly 600 years, priests at the Yatsurugi Shrine have observed ice cover on the lake here in the Japanese Alps, diligently recording it by hand and storing it safely, first in the shrine's vault and later in a local museum. These records represent one of the world's oldest continuous measurements of climate change, written long before the priests knew what they were providing.
Miyasaka is the fourth generation of his family to watch over the lake as priests at the shrine, keeping track of a phenomenon they called omiwatari, or the crossing of the gods.
For the omiwatari to form, the lake needs to freeze over completely and air temperatures have to stay below minus 10 degrees Celsius for several days in a row before warming ever so slightly. Then, with what at first sounds like distant drums, giant sheets of ice crack and buckle over each other into a miniature mountain range.
At first villagers feared the roaring sound of the crashing ice and imagined the ridge was the scaly back of a dragon living in the lake's watery depths.
""Do you know what the foundation for religion is?"" asks Miyasaka, speaking as if he's addressing a room full of students. ""Fear of nature. Then comes appreciation, then familiarity, and then we take it for granted.""
With global temperatures steadily rising in recent years, Lake Suwa rarely freezes solid, even in the coldest months of the year. The ice, once so thick that military tanks could rumble over it, is often too thin now for the mythic omiwatari to appear.
And the lake, once so central to the town's identity, is slowly vanishing from the everyday lives of the people who surround it. As winter nears, Lake Suwa provides an intimate reminder of damage wrought by climate change – and its ability to erase the very things people hold most dear.
During the entirety of the 17th century, there was only one year without a sighting of the omiwatari. Between the end of World War II and 1988, the ice ridge failed to form 13 times. Since then, the omiwatari has become rarer still. The crossing finally appeared last year after a four-year absence.
Miyasaka flips through a folder filled with newspaper clippings and photographs of the lake. In one laminated black-and-white picture, local firemen pose in front of a fighter plane that landed on the lake ice during a military exercise before World War II. In another, more recent photograph, Miyasaka and a group of local leaders stand precariously on the lake to examine an ice fracture beneath their gumboots.
""You could say the gods aren't hearing my prayers,"" he says, softening his words with a smile.
A CHILDHOOD ON THE LAKE
It's a little past 10 a.m. by the time Atsushi Momose finishes his coffee in his garden. He stubs out a hand-rolled cigarette in an ashtray and grabs a lifejacket off the ground. It's Sunday, but he still has to complete his daily routine of cleaning the lake he's loved since he was a child.
Momose removes a tarpaulin covering his kayak. He moves his hand over the gleaming wooden boat, which he built using a plan he ordered online. He hoists the kayak onto a trolley and rolls it onto a side street.
""These all used to be small inns and houses,"" he says as he passes by parking lots. A 14-story hotel blocks Momose's view of the lake from his childhood home, where he returned to care for his elderly father after retirement.
When he was a boy, a popular teenage movie star visited the lake wearing a figure skater's costume and expensive leather skates.
""I remember a bunch of us boys hanging around on the ice, trying to talk to her and then suddenly, she slipped and grabbed my arm for support,"" the 71-year-old says. ""My heart stopped. I still remember it.""
With the help of a friend, Momose hauls his kayak into the lake and slowly lowers himself onto the boat. It sinks under his weight, but he quickly regains balance and paddles out onto the water.
When Momose first returned to Suwa after a lifetime bouncing from one city to the next working as a documentary filmmaker, he was surprised to find the lake deserted. Plastic bottles and cigarette butts littered the water's edge. In winter, police and tourism organizations put up ugly red flags all around the lake to warn locals and tourists to stay away from the ice.
These days, Momose starts most mornings on the lake, picking up floating debris using long silver tongs.
""Nobody even looks at the lake anymore,"" he says as he braces his feet inside the kayak and floats in place. Murky water laps the sides of the boat. ""I think we should try and give back to this place since it gave us so much.""
Momose's paddle creates ripples in waters that are eerily quiet for a weekend morning. The only noise comes from a pair of children furiously pedaling a boat shaped like a swan, waving and calling out to parents who watch anxiously from a nearby pier.
IGNORED WARNINGS
Rusted fishing boats are still anchored near the pier. Kanji Fujimori, 75, who recently retired as the head of the local fisheries union, walks up the stairs of a local community center in his socks and sits at a large desk in the building's empty library.
Though he has retired, Fujimori still spends most of his days deep in research. He recently self-published two tell-all books about his tenure at the union, which had fallen into mismanagement and debt when he took over. In them, government bureaucrats with barely veiled pseudonyms refuse to listen to his warnings and fail to take aggressive measures to clean up the lake.
""I've been saying for years that the level of oxygen in that lake is dangerously low,"" he says. The community center's only staffer looks over at Fujimori, then returns to his computer.
""No one listened to me or believed me.""
Then, in July 2016, Fujimori got a call from a veteran fisherman that mounds of dead fish had washed up on the lake's shores overnight. He spent the rest of the day fielding calls from residents all around the lake with more sightings of dying fish. The ""mass death"" event, as he calls it, was so shocking it made it into national newspapers the next day.
The Suwa fisheries union estimated that around 80% of smelt in the lake washed up that day. A Nagano prefectural fisheries lab published a similar estimate. After the die-off, the prefecture created a task force of local professors and experts to study the lake.
Up until the 1940s, the local union regularly handled 1,000 tons of catch, mostly carp and smelt, a year. This has now dwindled to 10 tons, barely enough to supply local restaurants and hotels. The loss of ice in winter also means that traveling water birds can feast on fish year round. Because the birds are protected in Suwa and can't be shot, frustrated fishermen have resorted to chasing the birds with speedboats and using air horns to scare them away.
These days, there are only a few dozen fishermen on the lake, Fujimori says.
An alley behind the community center opens up to a scenic lakeside road, where an imposing mansion stands as one of the few reminders of Suwa's gilded past.
When Japan opened up to trade with the rest of the world in the late 19th century, raw silk made up the majority of the country's exports. Thousands of girls from neighboring villages were sent by their families to Suwa, where they lived in cramped dormitories and spent long, grueling hours working in silk mills. In its heyday, mills around Suwa manufactured the bulk of raw silk produced in Japan and is still considered by some to be the birthplace of the country's industrial revolution.
The mansion was built in the 1920s by a wealthy local nicknamed the ""silk emperor"" as a place where working women from nearby mills could rest and recuperate. The emperor's silk mills are long gone, but visitors still come to the mansion to see the gigantic Roman bath inside, large enough to fit 100 people at once, decorated with stained glass and marble statues. Next door, construction workers tear down an old hotel, leaving its once-grand rooms exposed to the weather outside.
CENTURIES OF MEMORIES
Less than a kilometer away, Yuichi Miyabara sits in his concrete office building overlooking the lake. The Shinshu University professor arrived here in 2001 to study Lake Suwa and the disruptions to its natural rhythms. His team takes regular samples from the lake and analyzes them to closely track fluctuations in the water's temperature and oxygen levels.
The only time his team avoids the lake is in the midst of winter. One of the first stories Miyabara heard when he arrived in Suwa was how a promising young researcher had died after falling through the ice decades earlier.
""This isn't a place where you can play,"" he says, explaining that even in summer, locals avoid swimming in the water because it was contaminated for decades by wastewater and later overrun by algae and weeds. ""The lake is more of a place you look at from a distance.""
After a decades-long effort by the prefecture to divert wastewater and remove pesky weeds and algae, Suwa's waters are noticeably cleaner now. But the natural circulation of the lake has also been disrupted by rising temperatures and shorter winters. Warm water is less dense and naturally sits above colder water, which sinks to the bottom of the lake. In the past, when summers were less hot and winters reliably cold, water at the lake's surface and its depths would settle at similar temperatures, aiding circulation. This would ensure that oxygen would mingle and saturate the entire lake.
Two decades ago, researchers at Suwa started noticing that dissolved oxygen levels five meters below the lake's surface were frequently dropping well below three milligrams per litre in the summer, an environment uninhabitable for most fish, just as Fujimori had long predicted.
Recently, the prefectural government has tested a project that funnels ""nano-bubbles"" of compressed oxygen into the lake through a plastic hose. Similar tests in the past have been unsuccessful.
An official in the prefectural division in charge of the project said it is still awaiting results from the August study, but conceded that continuing the project would require a ""considerable"" budget and had to be weighed carefully.
The contraption is a neat idea, Miyabara says, but it's hard to imagine how many machines it would take to pump enough oxygen into the lake.
""We're not talking about a small body of water. It's not like we can artificially mix the entire lake,"" he says.
More than 20 years ago, John Magnuson, a longtime researcher of inland waters at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was scouring the world for climate observations taken before the 1840s when he remembered Suwa. Magnuson flew to meet Miyasaka, the Shinto priest, and worked with a local researcher to trawl through the historic lake-ice data.
Magnuson found that since the advent of industrialization, ice began to freeze later in winter at Lake Suwa. In a 2016 paper published in Nature, Magnuson and his colleagues wrote that extreme warm weather had become more common in Suwa and attributed such changes to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide that has led to a rapid rise in local temperatures.
Annual air temperatures in Suwa have warmed at a rate of 2.4 degrees Celsius over the past century, double the national figure, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.
Between 1950 and 2014, Lake Suwa failed to freeze 17 times. In comparison, between 1443 to 1700, there were only three instances in which the lake didn't freeze over completely. And when it comes to the omiwatari, the absences have grown more common: In the 1990s, it once disappeared for six consecutive years.
""There is something different about a human being looking at the lake, saying it iced over or broke up, that resonates more than complicated paleoclimate research,"" says Magnuson, mentioning data taken from ice cores and tree rings that scientists can use to understand climate conditions from millions of years ago.
Human-made data has obvious shortfalls, Magnuson says, with sometimes damaged or partial recordings making it hard for researchers to draw large conclusions. ""But it's something people can relate to more easily, it's something that makes more sense to them,"" he says.
Scientists have since discovered even older data, like those taken since the 9th century at the Bodensee, a lake that straddles the Swiss, German and Austrian border. Churches on opposite banks of the lake used to carry a bust of St. John the Evangelist across the ice every winter.
But the Bodensee, also known as Lake Constance, stopped freezing in 1963, interrupting a centuries-old tradition. The religious relic is now permanently stored on the Swiss side of the water.
Magnuson predicts a similar fate for the Suwa omiwatari ritual. ""The future generation may not see ice on Suwa,"" he says.
Pausing on the phone, Magnuson asks after Miyasaka, and wonders if he has responded to a question about how he feels about the disappearance of the ice.
""I am curious how he feels about it, about the fact that he may be among the last to see the crossing,"" he says.
BOTH ANCIENT AND FLEETING
Miyasaka's shrine is a picture of restraint and modest repose, its buildings made of bare wood stripped and roughened by the elements. Water drizzles out of a shallow pool carved from stone, and droplets glisten on the blue-green moss that covers it. Much like the central tenet that guides Shinto beliefs, the shrine, though centuries old, feels as if it is one with the greenery surrounding it, both ancient and fleeting at once.
The hushed reverence of the shrine is rudely disturbed by Miyasaka's phone. His clamshell mobile rings incessantly with people asking him to approve festival plans and confirm venue reservations.
""Just give me the conclusion first, never mind the explanation,"" Miyasaka says as he balances his phone on one shoulder. ""OK, OK, OK, bye now,"" he finally says, hanging up with a sigh.
Aside from the annual occurrences of the omiwatari, the shrine's records also note major events in the towns surrounding the lake. In a particularly dramatic excerpt from the 1780s, Suwa's records show how a nearby volcano erupted and caused a historic famine across Japan.
""From July the second, a great fire on Mt. Asama raining ash,"" he reads, tracing the page with his finger. ""Roads blocked....large fog cast...harvest ruined...villagers starving.""
His voice gets higher and louder with excitement as he flips the page. ""What you learn is that people never write about good things; they only write about their difficulties,"" he says. ""When I read about these people tearing up the mountain to find something to eat, I realize again that people have always fought to survive, that hardship is the origin of everything.""
But with his knowledge of the sweep of history at the lake, how does he feel about the receding of the ice?
Every winter when a crowd of journalists asks him to give his verdict on yet another year without the omiwatari, he'll throw out a pithy line to get laughs. Asked the same question now, he begins to tidy a pile of papers.
Miyasaka's two sons left Suwa after high school, and both work in Tokyo. His oldest frequently travels abroad to conduct research for a large company.
""He's tried to explain to me what exactly he does for work, but I can't quite understand it,"" he says as the sun lights up the room in amber. His daughter lives nearby and helps when she can around the shrine. It remains unclear who will be next in line to observe the lake after Miyasaka retires. It also remains to be seen if the omiwatari will disappear entirely as ice continues to thin over the lake.
""But we are here to keep watch,"" Miyasaka says, ""whether the ice disappears or not.""
TWILIGHT ON THE LAKE
A few minutes after 4 p.m., as the sun begins to set, people begin gathering at the park overlooking the lake. Its waters still, the lake gradually turns tangerine, reflecting the clouds gathering above.
A young couple set up a small tripod for their iPhone and giggle as they dash into position, facing each other with their hands touching, the lake as their backdrop. They check through their burst of selfies, swiping the screen to find the perfect shot.
Nearby, an elderly woman in a crochet hat sits alone on a bench. She rubs her gloved hands together and takes in the scene. Fumiko Motokura, 84, comes to the park almost every day at this hour. She likes it here, a place with young people and foreign tourists, all mingling and waiting for the day to end.
""When I was a little girl, I could see the train come in every morning and see a line of workers walking along the lake to the watch factory there,"" she says, pointing down toward the center of the town. ""There was a training center here up on the hill where foreign students would come and learn how to make watches,"" she said. The building is now abandoned.
She misses the omiwatari as a symbol of winter and a sign of a new, prosperous year. Recounting the myth of the god crossing the frozen lake to visit his love, she smiles with her whole face.
""It's a romantic story, isn't it?"" she says.
The sun dips farther below the clouds and more visitors arrive, a few more of them acting out a memorable scene from an animated film released three years ago.
In the movie, a young woman and a man swap lives and bodies in their dreams, only to realize later that they are actually from separate timelines. The only place and time where they can reunite, a place free of all temporal restrictions, is at twilight above a lake that was inspired by Suwa.
As the sky deepens into night, a young woman steps out of her car and walks over to the edge of the park. She crosses her arms to keep warm and stares at the lake, her breath turning into vapor. In time, all that is left of the light disappears, and the lake fades into darkness at the center of town."
928,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:25AM ET</span>","Let's give Merkel coalition a chance, says incoming German SPD boss","BERLIN (Reuters) - The incoming leader of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) said on Friday she was skeptical that their ruling coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives would survive but she was ready to give it a chance.
SPD members last Saturday chose two critics of the coalition with Merkel to co-head their party after months of turmoil and dismal performances in regional and European elections. Many party members want to quit government and rebuild in opposition.
At a party conference on Friday, delegates are expected to vote on demands it will put to Merkel's conservatives to stay in government, including tougher climate protection measures, an increase in the minimum wage and investment in infrastructure.
""I was and I am skeptical about the future of this grand coalition. But with this resolution, we give the coalition a realistic chance of continuing - not more, not less,"" new SPD co-leader Saskia Esken told delegates.
Earlier, she had said the conference would send out a signal for a new start.
The conservatives have said they will not renegotiate the 2018 coalition deal but the relatively modest demands set out by the SPD's new leaders appear to avoid a direct confrontation with Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc.
Ditching the coalition could trigger a snap election or minority government - unsavory options for both ruling parties and for many stability-loving Germans. Merkel, who has led Europe's biggest economy for the last 14 years, has said she will not run for a fifth term.
The new leaders face a huge task. An Infratest dimap poll on Thursday put the SPD on 13%, only just off record lows and trailing the conservatives, environmentalist Greens and far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). 

Delegates are also expected to ratify Esken, a lawmaker in the Bundestag lower house, and Norbert Walter-Borjans, a former regional finance minister, as their new joint leaders.
 
"
929,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>","German Social Democrats Give Merkel Another Chance, With Demands","(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s Social Democrats are willing to throw Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government a lifeline but only if demands including more government spending are met, according to one of the party’s newly-elected leaders.
“I was and I remain skeptical about the coalition,” Saskia Esken said at the SPD party convention in Berlin. “With this lead motion, we are giving the coalition a chance to continue. Nothing more and nothing less, however long it may last.”
Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, a pair of outspoken coalition critics and Berlin outsiders, won an SPD leadership contest last weekend against a tandem led by coalition loyalist Olaf Scholz, Merkel’s finance minister and vice chancellor.
Later Friday, the delegates are expected to rally behind a proposal that sets out conditions -- including an increase in the minimum wage and tougher action on climate change -- for the party to remain in the coalition with Merkel. Walter-Borjans and Esken back-peddled on previous demands that would have been difficult for Merkel’s Christian Democratic-led bloc to accept.
SPD Wish List
The three-day convention marks the party’s latest effort to get itself on track after reluctantly entering a coalition to support Merkel for her fourth term two years ago. While the party’s leaders have softened their campaign pledges, they will still be under pressure from a restive base and negotiations with Merkel’s bloc won’t be easy.
Reopening a climate package that took months to secure will find little support from the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU. Equally, increasing the minimum wage toward the SPD target of 12 euros ($13) an hour could become a major bone of contention.
Pushing too hard could be risky as pulling out of the coalition could trigger a snap election. That could be disastrous with support for the SPD on par with the far-right AfD.

NASSIRIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - A short distance from a bridge in southern Nassiriya where Iraqi security forces gunned down their friends, young women and men set out rows of mock coffins, each draped in an Iraqi flag with pictures of the slain protesters taped on.
Murtadha Jodeh, a 25-year-old demonstrator who witnessed the killings that took place before dawn on Thursday last week, walked between more than 40 coffins laid out in three lines on the tarmac.
""This man, Mohammed, was killed by a bullet to the neck. Karar was shot in the side of the head. That other man in the heart,"" he said, pointing at each picture he recognized.
Raad Harbi, a 21-year-old camping out on the fire-blackened bridge on Wednesday days after security forces withdrew, said clashes lasted nearly two hours.
""They killed the last of my friends I'd protested with since October. I'm the only one left,"" he said.
Activists carried the coffins through the city, joining a mile-long march commemorating scores of Nassiriya residents killed in two months of demonstrations against the Iraqi government.
The clashes around Zaytoun Bridge on the Euphrates River were the single deadliest incident since unrest hit Baghdad on Oct. 1 and swept through southern Shi'ite Muslim heartlands, jolting Iraq out of two years of relative calm that followed the defeat of Islamic State.
Police and medics in Nassiriya said security forces killed 46 people after they opened fire on demonstrators blocking the bridge and other adjoining main roads.
Paramedics described scores of lethal wounds from rifle and machine gun fire against unarmed protesters. More than 400 protesters and more than a dozen members of the security forces have died in the unrest, including nearly 100 people in Nassiriya.
Iraq's government denies its forces have shot live ammunition directly at protesters and says they are there to protect them. It blames violence on unidentified saboteurs.
Some protesters have used petrol bombs and slingshots against police and public buildings and burned down the Iranian consulate in the southern city of Najaf last week.
In Nassiriya, Iraq's fourth-largest city and one of its poorest, the killings have fueled anger against authorities and Iran-backed political parties and militias that dominate state institutions.
'SAME BLOODSHED AS SADDAM'
Nassiriya is home to powerful southern Shi'ite tribes, birthplace of the Baath party that ruled the country under dictator Saddam Hussein and houses headquarters of Iraq's main Shi'ite, Iran-backed parties – now blackened, ransacked and abandoned after protesters torched them in October.
Activists who now control main thoroughfares and bridges in the city including Zaytoun Bridge say the bloodshed has stiffened their resolve.
They vow to stay put until the demands of Iraq's popular uprising are met - an overhaul of the political system and the departure of its corrupt ruling elite which they say has kept ordinary Iraqis poor and jobless.
Protesters inched a step closer to that goal after Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, a Nassiriya native, announced his resignation last week.
""The PM isn't enough – they all have to go,"" said Talib Faris, a tribal leader mourning the loss of two members of his clan at a square in the city.
He listed names of politicians including leaders of Iran-backed militias who have grown their power over government and parliament since the toppling of Saddam in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
""We don't want foreign interference, we don't want Iran. This is the same bloodshed as under Saddam, now at the hands of Shi'ite parties,"" he said.
As he spoke thousands of mourners poured into the square weeping and singing. Elderly tribal leaders struggled to keep up with energetic youth marches.
""Our generation is over the distraction of sectarianism. Look at the youth protesting in northern Sunni areas to support us,"" said Karar Hacham, a 30-year-old medic and activist.
""Some of the young men who died on the bridge didn't even have a place to sleep. This anger won't go away."""

OSWIECIM, Poland (Reuters) - Angela Merkel made her first visit on Friday to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial after 14 years as German chancellor, bringing a 60 million euro donation to help conserve the site where the Nazis ran their largest death camp.
Together with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a somber Merkel toured the camp's crematorium where victims' bodies were burned, before walking through the camp's iron gate bearing the motto ""Arbeit macht frei"" (Work sets you free) and visiting the camp's brick barracks.
During her term, Merkel has not shied away from admitting German responsibility for its atrocities in World War Two, but her visit will ensure she follows in the footsteps of two former chancellors by seeing the site before her term ends.
""Auschwitz is a museum but is also the biggest cemetery in the world... (Memory) is the key to building the present and future,"" museum director Piotr Cywinski told Reuters ahead of Merkel's visit at the invitation of the Auschwitz foundation.
Merkel will announce the donation, half of which comes from Germany's federal government and half from its regional governments, at a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation.
The money will cement Germany's place as the largest donor to the foundation, which funds the conservation efforts for the site where more than 1 million people, mostly Jews, died in what was then Nazi-occupied Poland.
The Polish government is one of the largest financial supporters of the Auschwitz museum as a whole, having funded more than 20% of its budget in 2018 alone. 
More than 3 million of Poland's 3.2 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust, roughly around half of all Jews murdered during World War Two.
The money will ensure that the conservation of 30 brick barracks in the Birkenau camp site as well as an old kitchen and latrine, for example, can continue. 
""Many of the buildings were not built to last long,"" Cywinski said, adding that the foundation needs between 18 million zlotys to 20 million zlotys ($4.62 million to $5.13 million) annually for conservation work.
Among other tasks, the museum has to prevent the decay of relics of the victims, such as hair, shoes and eye glasses. 

Two years ago Cywinski appealed to donor countries for more support. Germany is the only country that has responded to date. The United States and Poland have previously been big donors.

In just over a year, Thunberg has inspired younger protesters in a global movement demanding action to slow the atmospheric warming that climate scientists say could ultimately endanger the survival of industrial societies.
Stepping off the night train Lusitania at Chamartin train station in the Spanish capital, the 16-year-old Swede completed a hastily arranged expedition, including a 21-day catamaran voyage across the Atlantic, to a U.N. conference originally planned in Santiago, Chile. 
Thunberg was met by a crowd of reporters but did not speak as she left the train. 
""I successfully managed to sneak into Madrid this morning! I don't think anyone saw me ... Anyway it's great to be in Spain!"" Thunberg tweeted after leaving the station. 
The Lusitania, which runs daily, is the only direct train link between Lisbon and Madrid and takes nine hours to travel overnight between the capitals. 
The annual summit kicked off on Monday with a call from U.N. chief Antonio Guterres not to be the ""generation ... that fiddled while the planet burned"". 
Thunberg is due to take part in a mass march and make a speech later in Madrid. 
At the last U.N. climate event in September, she harangued delegates, demanding: ""How dare you?"" and declaring, ""You have stolen my dreams.""
By this meeting's close on Dec. 13, negotiators hope to resolve remaining disagreements on how to implement an agreement struck in Paris in 2015 to limit a rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. 
They saved the deal from disintegrating last year by agreeing guidelines for putting it into effect, but current pledges fall well short of the temperature target and sticking points remain among signatories.
President Donald Trump has started the process of withdrawing the United States, the top historic greenhouse gas emitter, from the accord.
Spain has said a desire to prevent this move from sapping morale around the project was one of its reasons for offering to host after riots over inequality prompted Chile to withdraw.

Yegor Zhukov, a 21-year-old student and politics blogger on YouTube, was among more than 1,000 people detained in Moscow on July 27 in one of the biggest crackdowns of recent years. He and others had taken to the streets to call for free elections.
The court on Friday found him guilty of inciting extremism on his YouTube channel and banned him from using the Internet for two years.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - As Argentina's new government prepares to take power, the key role of economy chief is shrouded in mystery, with a trio of economists leading the field as the country grapples with how to fight inflation, recession and rising debt.
President-elect Alberto Fernandez will announce his cabinet on Friday evening, with all eyes on who will be the new minister of Treasury when the center-left leader is sworn into office on Dec. 10.
Fernandez is likely to back a sharp shift in economic approach to outgoing conservative President Mauricio Macri, whose International Monetary Fund-backed austerity helped cut fiscal deficits but hammered his popularity with voters.
Sources and creditors told Reuters that Martin Guzman - an acolyte of Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz - and heterodox economist Matias Kulfas were two of the top names. On Thursday, major local newspaper La Nacion said lesser-known Martin Abeles was also in the running.
The picks could define the economic direction of Latin America's no. 3 economy over the next four years and impact grain traders and industries, as well as debt-restructuring negotiations with international creditors and the IMF over around $100 billion in sovereign debt as default fears loom.
Argentina's markets and the peso currency have been on edge since Fernandez won a resounding victory in an Aug. 11 primary election, a shock that spelled the end for Macri, a champion of business and free markets.
The makeup of the economic roles - and whether there will be one powerful ministry or several ministries working in tandem - has sparked fierce speculation, with the last-minute reveal spooking investors and keeping bonds in distressed territory.
""The fact that Fernandez has left it this late suggests to us that it's not necessarily a priority of his to help investors and guide Argentina with a market-friendly approach,"" said Nikhil Sanghani, London-based economist at Capital Economics.
'MUTUAL ADMIRATION SOCIETY'
Guzman, a young academic and protégé of Stiglitz, is considered an expert in the field of debt restructuring, though he has little hands-on experience.
""I like Guzman. He's smart and you can talk to him. And he will play by rules,"" said one major international bondholder who views Guzman, a scholar at Columbia University in New York, as a favorable choice for leading debt restructuring.
Others, however, felt he was too aligned with Vice President-elect Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a divisive, populist ex-president.
""It's a mutual admiration society between her and Stiglitz. She loves him for his anti-IMF, anti-austerity views,"" said Carlos Abadi, managing director at financial advisory firm DecisionBoundaries.
Kulfas, who previously held government and central bank positions, is seen more in the ""classic Peronist school of thought,"" and could raise taxes on exports and prioritize local creditors over international bondholders, economists said.
""Their way to solve Argentina's problems will be to stimulate domestic demand, and if that requires monetary expansion of some sort, that's fine with them,"" said one local economist, who requested anonymity.
Abeles, meanwhile, served in the Ministry of Economy under Fernandez de Kirchner and her late husband and presidential predecessor Nestor Kirchner.
Abeles is currently local head of the U.N.'s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), and is married to Cecilia Todesca, a close economic adviser to Fernandez.
Jose Dapena, an economist and director of the finance department at the University of CEMA in Buenos Aires, noted that all three lack ministerial experience.
""It seems this administration wants people who are not yet high-profile, who will follow and obey policies,"" he said.
Kulfas and Guzman did not respond to requests for comment. Abeles could not immediately be reached by Reuters.
CURVE BALL?
While the three are considered the mostly likely contenders for the top economic jobs, Argentina watchers are not ruling out a surprise pick.
Guillermo Nielsen, another key economic adviser to Fernandez, could take an economic role in the government. He is already known among bondholders for leading tense negotiations with Argentina's creditors in 2005.
Other well-known Fernandez confidants, including Todesca and Martin Redrado, who both held senior roles at the central bank, are also expected to be tapped as economic advisers."

Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani urged political leaders to abandon partisan politics in choosing a new head of government and said he would have no involvement in efforts to replace Abdul Mahdi.
""We hope a new head of government and its members will be chosen within the constitutional deadline"" of 15 days since the resignation was formalized in parliament on Sunday, a representative of Sistani said in his Friday sermon in the holy city of Kerbala.
""It must also take place without any foreign interference,"" he said.
Abdul Mahdi pledged to step down on Friday last week after Sistani urged lawmakers to reconsider their support for the government following two months of anti-establishment protests where security forces have killed more than 400 demonstrators.
Iraq's two main allies, the United States and Iran, have acted as power brokers in Iraq since the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, although Tehran's allies have mostly dominated state institutions since then.
Iranian officials including the powerful commander of its Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani, stepped in to prevent Abdul Mahdi's resignation in October, Reuters reported.
Soleimani was reported to be in Baghdad this week.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's police chief has urged citizens to demonstrate peacefully ahead of an expected large turnout on Sunday for a pro-democracy march that organizers said aimed to show the movement retained strong momentum.
Police have given a rare green light to the demonstration, organized by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), the group that called the largely peaceful million-strong marches in the summer. 
""We hope our citizens can show the whole world (that) Hong Kong people are capable of holding a large scale rally in an orderly and peaceful manner,"" new police commissioner Chris Tang said before departing on a ""courtesy visit"" to Beijing.
Tang was expected to meet senior officials of China's ministry of public security and return to Hong Kong hours before Sunday's protest.
The march will be a gauge of support for the pro-democracy movement following its victory in local elections last month.
""We want to tell Carrie Lam that the election results are not the end of the movement,"" CHRF vice-convener Eric Lai said, referring to the chief executive of the Chinese-ruled city.
The unrest in Hong Kong is the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
The former British colony has been racked by six months of pro-democracy protests, sparked by a now-withdrawn China extradition bill, but which widened into calls for greater democratic freedoms.
Protesters have set out five demands, including an investigation into alleged police brutality and universal suffrage. Beijing has condemned the unrest and blamed foreign interference.
Despite the increasingly violent tactics of some protesters, pro-democracy candidates won almost 90 percent of seats in the Nov. 24 local elections, following the highest voter turnout since local polls began in 1999.
Hong Kong has since enjoyed some calm, which the police chief said he hoped could be maintained.
""In the last two weeks the city was relatively peaceful,"" he said. ""When the citizens have a chance to take a breather, we hope the violent people will really stop engaging in illegal activities.""
ECONOMIC STRAIN
Results of a survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI) released Friday show public satisfaction with the police has plummeted in the past year.
Calculated on a ranking out of 100, with zero representing very dissatisfied, the police scored 35.34, almost halving from November last year when police scored 62.48.
Net satisfaction with the police is the lowest since 1997, when PORI began comparable polling. 
Protesters plan a smaller rally late Friday against police use of tear gas, which they say is excessive and harms innocent bystanders. Police have said their use of force has been restrained. 
Economic data this week points to the growing toll of the sustained protests on the major global financial hub, which slid into recession this year for the first time in a decade.
The unrest has contributed 2 percentage points to Hong Kong's third-quarter economic contraction of 3.2%, Finance Secretary Paul Chan told legislators on Friday.
On Wednesday, Chan pledged new relief measures of an extra HK$4 billion ($511.19 million), taking total stimulus plans to HK$25 billion.
Subway operator MTR Corp expects a decline of HK$1.6 billion in full-year net profit, hit by a drop of 14% in passengers during the protests, as well as damage to its stations and facilities.
By Saturday, transport authorities will complete a review of plans for a cash injection for Hong Kong Airlines, which is battling a steep decline in demand as a result of the protests.
Raising funds is crucial for the local carrier, partly owned by cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, to get its license renewed.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea, one of the world's most reclusive states, plans to branch out into medical tourism next year, offering foreign visitors, most likely from China, treatments including cataract surgery, dental implants and therapy for tumors.
The ruling party's Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported on Friday the recent launch of the ""Treatment Tourism Exchange Corporation"", aimed at capitalizing on the ""rising demand for tourism, including medical care, in line with an international trend"".
The new state entity will operate health clinics near hot springs, whose mineral waters, it said, can help treat neuralgia, arthritis, and heart and skin ailments.
Private tourism is one of the few remaining areas of business not blocked by sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.
As many as 350,000 Chinese tourists have visited North Korea this year, potentially netting the authorities up to $175 million, according to some analysts.
Last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a hot spring resort nearing completion in the central alpine town of Yangdok, one of major construction projects at the heart of his drive to build a ""self-reliant"" economy.
Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies in Seoul, described the medical tourism campaign as propaganda designed at showing progress, while adding that it could appeal to some Chinese tourists.
""North Korea primarily offers natural tourist attractions and appears to believe they can be a money maker if combined with elements of oriental medicine, which many Chinese people like,"" he said.
A recent report by a government-affiliated health institute in neighboring South Korea said North Korea was struggling to provide basic health care.
""The reality is that primary-care providers — local clinics and doctors — are so short of basic equipment and supplies that they barely provide what may be called medical consultation,"" it concluded in the report on the state of the health sector in the North.
""The situation is not much better for secondary-care providers including state hospitals in cities and counties,"" it said."

Omoyele Sowore, who ran for president in the February election in which former military ruler President Muhammadu Buhari secured a second term in office, was arrested in August and in September pleaded not guilty to charges of treason, money laundering and harassing the president.
His continued detention despite being granted bail in October has led to criticism of Buhari's administration and claims that human rights have been flouted in this case and those of other high-profile figures.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Fire is not natural in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Virgin rainforest, no matter how fierce the sun, is too wet to catch alight. If the forest burns it is almost always because of humans.
In August, around the peak of the so-called ""queimadas"" as the burning season here is known, the number of fires in Brazil's Amazon jumped to its highest since 2010.
Fire is the second stage in clearing the forest, usually for raising cattle. First, choice woods are cut and sold, then the rest is burned. It is cheap, it is effective, and it is hard to catch those responsible.
Cutting down the forest is illegal without permission, and using fire is against the law except in exceptional circumstances.
Yet fire is changing the landscape.
The latest data from August 2018 through July 2019 showed more rainforest was cleared than at any point in the past 11 years. An area larger than Puerto Rico was cut down. Preliminary figures suggest the rate has increased since.
Three teams of Reuters journalists spent weeks traveling thousands of miles across the world's largest tropical rainforest this year, witnessing the devastation of what scientists regard as a vital protection against climate change.
On the Trans-Amazonian highway, near the river port of Humaita, the August night sky did not go dark. The flames from a forest fire, stretching into the distance beside the road, glowed a dusky yellow. For days it burned.
Some people have taken protecting the forest into their own hands. Reuters spent seven days with an indigenous vigilante group fighting to keep illegal loggers off their land in the state of Maranhao.  
One night in September, alerted by the rumble of heavy trucks, six Guajajara tribesmen – faces painted for battle – rushed to ambush a group of loggers.
At a choke point in the local network of rutted dirt roads, they lay in wait, a 4x4 blocking the road, rifles and handguns at the ready. 
When the trucks arrived, the loggers, who numbered around eight, were first to fire. The Guajajara shot back, forcing the loggers to scatter into the forest. The indigenous warriors burnt the trucks, piled high with freshly cut lumber. 
One of the men that night was Paulo Paulino Guajajara. He knew it was dangerous work and spoke frankly of his fear. ""I'm scared at times, but we have to lift up our heads and act. We are here fighting,"" he said.

Four weeks later, he was dead. Members of his tribe said loggers had shot him through the head.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Firefighters battled to contain nearly 150 fires burning in New South Wales state on Friday as strong winds fanned the flames and again shrouded Sydney, Australia's biggest city, in hazardous smoke.
Bushfires have killed at least four people and destroyed more than 680 homes since the start of November. Fires are still burning in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland states.
While nearly 150 blazes were alight across Australia's east coast, New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said authorities were particularly concerned about eight fires now at emergency levels around Sydney, the state capital where about 5 million people live.
""They have the potential or are expected to spread further east, which unfortunately is getting into more populated areas, villages, communities, isolated rural areas, and other farming practices and businesses throughout the region,"" Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney.
Several fires to the northwest of the city had joined together to create one massive blaze, spreading with hot, dry winds, he said.
Bushfires are common in Australia, but this year's fire season has begun much earlier than usual, with temperatures soaring regularly above 40 degrees C (104°F) before the start of the southern summer and high winds scouring the drought-parched landscape.

First, the Biden campaign posted a video on Twitter that brutally took down President Donald Trump, suggesting he is a laughingstock to other world leaders. Then a heated back-and-forth with an Iowa voter quickly went viral.
Together, the moments generated a digital buzz that has often eluded Biden, whose campaign appeals most to traditional, older Democratic voters. Such attention has generally been enjoyed instead by some of his chief rivals in the 2020 Democratic presidential race.
The 77-year-old former vice president continues to lead among Democrats in national polls and has so far withstood challenges from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others in the battle for the party's nomination to take on Trump in the November 2020 election. 
The normally affable Biden lost his composure at a campaign event in New Hampton, Iowa, on Thursday, sparring with a man in the crowd who questioned him about his role in the Ukraine scandal that has been dogging Trump.
""You're a damn liar, man,"" Biden told the man, who suggested without evidence that Biden had helped his son Hunter land a lucrative position with the Ukrainian oil company Burisma.
""No one has said my son has done anything wrong,"" Biden said. ""Get your words straight, jack.""
Trump's request that Ukraine launch an investigation targeting Joe Biden is at the center of the impeachment probe of the president being conducted by the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption, without offering evidence. They have denied wrongdoing, and the allegations have not been substantiated.
The heckler at the Iowa event also questioned Biden's fitness for office. Biden responded by challenging the man to a push-up contest or an IQ test - and appeared at one point to call him ""fat.""
The video of the exchange quickly made the rounds on Twitter. Trump's re-election campaign posted it, suggesting that Biden had gone ""berserk."" 
A Biden campaign aide later said online that Biden had said ""facts,"" not ""fat."" 
MILLIONS OF VIEWS
Earlier, the Biden campaign had been basking in accolades for its Twitter post playing off a clip taken at a NATO summit in Britain this week that appeared to show Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joking about Trump's press appearances during a chat with other world leaders.
""The world is laughing,"" read the text over that clip and others of Trump's trips abroad. ""We need a leader the world respects.""
Democratic pundits and strategists on Twitter praised the spot as perhaps Biden's most effective yet. As of Thursday evening, it had garnered more than 9 million views. The campaign soon posted it to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and told Reuters it was also promoting it to likely caucus-goers in the early presidential nominating state of Iowa on Instagram, YouTube and Hulu.
The campaign also used the video in a fundraising pitch on Thursday, asking supporters to help turn the online ad into a TV spot.
""TV ads are expensive. We want to raise $150,000 today,"" read an email from the campaign.
The Twitter spot was conceived and produced in-house, the Biden campaign said. ""When (Biden) saw the painful reception that Trump received from world leaders representing countries that have traditionally been strong American allies, it struck a chord and he felt the need to speak out,"" a Biden aide said. 
The Trump campaign condemned it.
""As the president has said, Joe Biden claims that foreign leaders have told him they want him to win the election. Of course they do, they want to keep ripping off the United States like they did before Trump became president,"" campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. 
Biden's campaign was endorsed on Thursday by John Kerry, the former U.S. senator and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee. Kerry was also secretary of state under Democratic President Barack Obama, whom Biden served as vice president.
""I've never before seen the world more in need of someone who on day one can begin the incredibly hard work of putting back together the world Donald Trump has smashed apart,"" Kerry said in a statement, crediting Biden's help on fighting Islamic State and striking a deal on Iran's nuclear program.

Kerry will join Biden on the campaign trail on Friday in Iowa and on Sunday in New Hampshire. The states will be the first to vote on a Democratic nominee next February, and Kerry won both states in the 2004 primaries.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 08:15PM ET</span>","As scandal simmers, majority of Japan firms want PM Abe to finish term: Reuters poll","By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - A majority of Japanese firms want long-serving Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to finish his term to September 2021 but fewer than one in five say he should stay beyond then, a Reuters poll showed, as allegations that he broke campaign laws erode public support.
Opposition lawmakers allege Abe favored supporters with invites to an annual state-funded cherry-blossom viewing party and may have broken campaign laws by subsidizing backers’ attendance at a reception the night before. Questions have also arisen over whether a gangster attended the state-funded event and why this year's invitation list was shredded. 
The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing.
Abe, who quit after a troubled 2006-07 term and returned to office in December 2012 promising to revive the economy, in November became Japan's longest serving premier, breaking a record set over a century ago.
""A lengthy administration invites concentration of power and corruption may easily emerge, but there is no other politician with the experience and ability,"" a manager at a textile firm said in a written response explaining why Abe should stay on.
Fifty-nine percent said Abe should complete his term as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader but then step down. Another 16% want him to stay longer.
That would require a rule change by the LDP, whose head is virtually assured the premiership if the party stays in power.
Twenty-five percent, though, said he should quit sooner. 
""Domestically, there is a feeling of stagnation and friction with neighboring countries has emerged,"" wrote a manager at a transport-equipment firm.
Japan's relations with U.S. ally South Korea have chilled due to a feud over their shared wartime legacy, although ties with China have improved.
Media polls have shown the cherry-blossom affair chipping away at voter support, although backing for the fragmented opposition remains weak. A Mainichi newspaper survey published Monday showed a six point drop to 42% from October.
The decline has not ended speculation that Abe might call a snap lower-house election to renew his mandate.
Former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba, an outspoken Abe critic, topped the list - barely - of lawmakers respondents want to take over as premier when Abe's term ends, with 17% to Abe's 16%. LDP rising star Shinjiro Koizumi was the choice for 11%.

The corporate survey, conducted from Nov. 20 to Dec. 2 for Reuters by Nikkei Research, canvassed 502 big and midsize non-financial companies. Roughly 240 firms answered questions on politics on condition of anonymity to express opinions freely.

949,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 08:00PM ET</span>",The Lady and The Hague: Myanmar leader Suu Kyi courts home audience,"By Shoon Naing, Thu Thu Aung and Poppy McPherson
YANGON (Reuters) - The last time Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi traveled to western Europe, she was feted as the freshly elected civilian ruler of a fledgling democracy who had brought an end to half a century of military dictatorship.
When the Nobel peace prize laureate returns next week, her first trip to the region since a 2017 military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in western Myanmar, it will be to face accusations of genocide, alongside the army she spent much of her life battling.
Gambia, a tiny, mainly Muslim West African state backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), lodged a lawsuit at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last month against Myanmar for genocide, including mass murder and rape.
Myanmar denies the allegations, and Suu Kyi's office said she would fly to The Hague for the first hearings, from Dec. 10, to ""defend the national interest"".
""There is a discrepancy between the opinion of Myanmar and the international community,"" said Myo Nyunt, the senior spokesman for her National League for Democracy Party. ""She has to explain what has really taken place in northern Rakhine.""
Her decision to attend took some by surprise. People close to her with strong international connections voiced concerns it could further tarnish her image abroad, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
But at home the announcement has unleashed a wave of popular support, with the leader who spent 15 years under house arrest for defying the army lauded as once again championing the interests of the people against a common enemy.
Richard Horsey, Myanmar advisor to the International Crisis Group, said while her appearance carried considerable risks for Suu Kyi overseas, ""she likely feels that she must do all she can to defend the national interest against what most people in Myanmar see as biased and politically-motivated charges"".
Suu Kyi was still a heroine to many when she last visited western Europe and the United States months after taking office in 2016. Her star faded in office amid sluggish reform and protracted ethnic conflicts, and she faced increasingly harsh criticism from the West as the Rohingya crisis unfolded. 
'NO GENOCIDE'
An offensive by security forces and local Buddhists in northern Rakhine state in August 2017 drove more than 730,000 Rohingya into neighboring Bangladesh, where they created the world's largest refugee camp.
United Nations investigators have said the exodus was the result of a military campaign executed with ""genocidal intent"".
Myanmar authorities have strongly disputed that conclusion, categorizing the military operation as a legitimate response to attacks by Rohingya militants that killed 13 members of the security forces.
In September 2017, Suu Kyi said terrorists were behind an ""iceberg of misinformation"" about the violence.
""Myanmar people do not support people being driven from their homes. But it is different with these Bengalis leaving,"" spokesman Myo Nyunt said, using a term common in Myanmar but rejected by the Rohingya because it implies they are interlopers from Bangladesh who invented an ethnic identity.
Seven soldiers were jailed for 10 years for killing 10 Rohingya men and boys in the village of Inn Din, but granted early release last November after serving less than a year in prison.
Late last month, the military began a court martial of an unspecified number of soldiers over events in another village, Gu Dar Pyin, the site of an alleged massacre of 10 Rohingya. The military said the soldiers were ""weak in following the rules of engagement."" No further details were given about the court martial, which is continuing.
""As far as we know there is Inn Din massacre and Gu Dar Pyin,"" said Myo Nyunt. ""That's all... As far as [Suu Kyi] knows, there is no such thing as genocide.""
‘EVERYTHING IS POLITICS’
Recent weeks in Myanmar have had the flavor of election season, with several pro-Suu Kyi rallies in major cities attended by hundreds of people carrying flags. More are planned for the first day of the hearings.
""Now there are demonstrations across the whole country. This is an attempt to make her image stronger,"" said Ko Ko Gyi, a longtime democracy activist and former Suu Kyi ally. ""There is a saying – everything is politics.""
Myanmar is due to go to the polls again in 2020 and, while an opinion poll from the People's Alliance for Credible Elections, an independent group of election monitors, in July showed Suu Kyi retains tremendous support, her government has faced criticism for failing to bring an end to worsening ethnic conflicts in the borderlands or reform the constitution.
Under the charter drafted by the former ruling junta, the military chief nominates a quarter of lawmakers, giving it a veto over constitutional change.

In the southeastern Karen state, regional authorities put up dozens of billboards showing a smiling Suu Kyi flanked by three green-clad soldiers laughing heartily underlined by the words ""we stand with you"".

950,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 07:43PM ET</span>","Mexico, top U.S. law official Barr had 'good meeting' on cartel threat: president","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he and senior government officials had a ""good meeting"" with U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Thursday about the threat of Mexican drug cartels.
Barr met various senior officials after U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he would designate the drug gangs as terrorist organizations in response to a series of bloody security breaches triggered by cartel gunmen.
""As a lawyer, he understands our constitution obligates us to adhere to the principles of cooperation for development and non-intervention in foreign affairs,"" Lopez Obrador said of Barr on Twitter. ""In this way we will always be able to work together.""
He did not provide more details.
Tensions over the cartels intensified last month when suspected cartel hitmen massacred three women and six children of U.S.-Mexican origin in northern Mexico.
Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference ahead of the talks that they would focus on bilateral cooperation, and that officials would review a document that would serve as a point of reference.
The two sides discussed their security priorities and among other topics, they ""talked about cooperation in arms trafficking, money laundering, international drug trafficking and how to deal with transnational crime and international drug trafficking,"" Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement.
The Mexican officials who met Barr and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau included Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, Security Minister Alfonso Durazo and the head of the Navy Jose Rafael Ojeda.
The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday it was working with the Mexican government to identify the ""appropriate tools"" to help it tackle the threat posed by cartels.
Designating groups as terrorist organizations aims to disrupt the finances of suspected members and their supporters via U.S. sanctions such as asset freezes and travel bans.
While it would not directly give the United States authority for military operations in Mexico, many Mexicans are nervous Trump could use it as a pretext for intervention.
Lopez Obrador has attempted to pursue a less confrontational approach to the gangs and has rejected any intervention. He has held out the prospect of cooperation with the United States but says his government has the wherewithal to tackle the problem."
951,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 07:42PM ET</span>","In rare legal test, Myanmar faces genocide hearings at The Hague","By Stephanie van den Berg and Anthony Deutsch
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - In a wood-panelled hall of the ornate Peace Palace at The Hague, lawyers pressing a case against Myanmar for alleged genocide against its Muslim Rohingya minority will next week ask judges to order immediate action to protect them from further violence.
Gambia, a tiny, mainly Muslim West African country, filed a lawsuit in November accusing Myanmar of genocide, the most serious international crime.
During three days of hearings starting Dec. 10, it will ask the 16-member panel of U.N. judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to impose ""provisional measures"" to protect the Rohingya before the case can be heard in full.
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh since a 2017 military crackdown, which U.N. investigators found in August to have been carried out with ""genocidal intent"". Myanmar vehemently denies allegations of genocide.
The office of Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace prize laureate, has said she will lead her country's defense personally. Myanmar's legal team is expected to argue that genocide did not occur, that the top U.N. court lacks jurisdiction and that the case fails to meet a requirement that a dispute exists between Myanmar and Gambia.
Gambia's request for a provisional injunction is the legal equivalent of seeking a restraining order against a country.
""If the court feels there is sufficient threat and it needs to step in, it can ... order Myanmar to cease and desist in terms of military operations and violence so that civilians are protected,"" said Priya Pillai, an international lawyer with the Asia Justice Coalition, an NGO.
In an overcrowded refugee camp in Bangladesh, 22-year-old Mohammed Nowkhim said he and fellow Rohingya were ""waiting and praying"" for a good outcome in The Hague, although most will be unable to watch the hearings due to poor internet access.
Nowkhim said he escaped Buthidaung town, an urban center of northern Rakhine state, with his neighbors in August 2017.
""Our remaining villagers decided that we can't stay any more. If we stay they will kill us. So we gathered in one place and started our journey to Bangladesh,"" he told Reuters.
""Our Rohingya communities are waiting for the resolution of ICJ. We hope that something will change after ICJ,"" he said.
HIGH LEGAL BAR
A decision on provisional measures is expected within weeks. Hearings dealing with the core allegation of genocide could begin in 2020, but cases at the ICJ, the leading U.N. court for disputes between states, often take years.
The legal threshold for a finding of genocide is high. Just three cases have been recognized under international law since World War Two: Cambodia in the late 1970s; Rwanda in 1994; and Srebrenica, Bosnia, in 1995.
""Proving genocide has been difficult because of the high bar set by its 'intent requirement' - that is showing the genocidal acts, say killings, were carried out with the specific intent to eliminate a people on the basis of their ethnicity,"" said Richard Dicker, head of the international justice program at New York-based Human Rights Watch.
Buddhist majority Myanmar rejects accusations of genocide against the Muslim population, but the government declined to provide details about its defense case ahead of the hearings.
""Allegations are easy,"" Thaung Tun, a senior member of Suu Kyi's cabinet, said in a tweet on Dec.1.
""But in law genocidal intent has to be established beyond reasonable doubt. It shouldn't be confused with personal motive prompting actions of a perpetrator. There must be sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, a policy to destroy the group.""
Myanmar has previously denied almost all allegations made by refugees against its troops, including of mass rape, killings and arson. It says the army was engaged in a legitimate counterterrorism operation against Rohingya militants.
The U.N. investigators concluded that sexual violence committed by Myanmar troops against Rohingya women and girls in 2017 indicated the military intended to destroy the mainly Muslim ethnic minority.
Myanmar's government failed to hold anyone accountable and was therefore responsible ""under the Genocide Convention for its failure to investigate and punish acts of genocide"", the investigators' report said. 
Those findings, along with other court cases launched against Myanmar in recent weeks, could play an important role in the ICJ proceedings.

""It's difficult to overstate the importance of what is unfolding at the ICJ,"" Dicker, at Human Rights Watch, said. ""The global significance lies in that this is the first time the Genocide Convention has been put to use in the way its framers intended.""

952,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 06:31PM ET</span>",U.S. Uighur bill's threat to surveillance economy puts China on offensive,"By Matt Spetalnick, Patricia Zengerle and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China reacted angrily to President Donald Trump's approval of legislation supporting Hong Kong protesters last month, but movement on another congressional bill, backing Uighur Muslims in China's northwest, has cut even closer to the bone and could trigger reprisals and hurt efforts to resolve the U.S.-China trade war.U.S. congressional sources and China experts say Beijing appears especially sensitive to provisions in the Uighur Act passed by the House of Representatives this week banning exports to China of items that can be used for surveillance of individuals, including facial and voice-recognition technology.
China will also be upset that the bill - which still requires Senate passage and Trump's signature to become law - calls for sanctions against a member of the powerful politburo for the first time. But its commercial stipulations have even more practical power to hurt the interests of Chinese leaders, sources say.
Senior members of both Congress and the Trump administration have sounded the alarm on China's detention of at least a million Uighur Muslims, by U.N. estimates, in the northwestern region of Xinjiang as a grave abuse of human rights and religious freedom. China rejects the charges.
A Chinese government source, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters China could tolerate the Hong Kong bill, but the Uighur Act went too far and could jeopardize efforts to reach a phase-one deal to end a trade war buffeting the global economy that Trump has made a key priority.
A U.S. congressional source also said a Washington-based figure close to the Chinese government told him recently it disliked the Uighur bill more than the Hong Kong bill for “dollars and cents reasons,” because the former measure contained serious export controls on money-spinning security technology, while also threatening asset freezes and visa bans on individual officials.
Victor Shih, an associate professor of China and Pacific Relations at the University of California, San Diego, said mass surveillance was big business in China and a number of tech companies there could be hurt by the law if it passes.
China spent roughly 1.24 trillion yuan ($176 billion) on domestic security in 2017 - 6.1% of total government spending and more than was spent on the military. Budgets for internal security, of which surveillance technology is a part, have doubled in regions including Xinjiang and Beijing.
Shih said investors in such firms included family members of China's political elite, who could suffer financially if the bill became law.
""This bill affects bottom lines, this is why there is a stronger reaction from Beijing,"" he said.
Shih said the bill would affect the ability of Chinese companies to procure technology from the United States and this would adversely affect their product development. He said it could also affect their ability to list on U.S. markets.
CHINESE WARNINGS
China has warned that the Uighur bill would affect bilateral cooperation, raising concerns about the impact on trade talks, less than two weeks before a new round of U.S. tariffs already threatening another breakdown is scheduled to take effect.
In editorials on Thursday, Chinese official media called for harsh reprisals in response to bill. [L8N28F02P]
The English-language China Daily called the bill a ""stab in the back, given Beijing's efforts to stabilize the already turbulent China-U.S. relationship"" and warned of reprisals.
""It seems an odds-on bet that more (sanctions) can be expected if the latest approval for State Department meddling goes into the statute books,"" it said.
China's envoy to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said on Wednesday the two countries were trying to resolve their differences over trade, but ""destructive forces"" were trying to drive a wedge between them.
The White House has yet to say whether Trump would sign or veto the bill, which contains a provision allowing the president to waive sanctions if he determines it to be in the national interest.
No dates has yet been scheduled for a vote on the bill in the Republican-controlled Senate, a decision which rests with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said lawmakers would proceed with caution.
“Because of the relationship we have with China, because of the trade negotiations going on, and everything else, it's important that we don't do anything that would cause those negotiations not to bear fruit,"" Risch told Reuters."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cleared a first hurdle on Thursday after the leader of the opposition Bloc Quebecois party said he would support the new minority government's priorities, at least initially. 
Trudeau's Liberals were re-elected in October but lost their parliamentary majority and need the support of at least one opposition party to stay in power and pass legislation. 
""Some believe that minority governments are incapable of getting things done. But Canada's history tells us otherwise,"" Governor General Julie Payette - head of state Queen Elizabeth's representative in Ottawa - said in a speech she delivered on behalf of the prime minister. 
After the speech outlining the new government's priorities, which could lead to a parliamentary vote of confidence, Bloc leader Yves-Francois Blanchet said his party would back it. 
""I am going to support the speech because I see in (it) many opportunities ... to make some gains for Quebec,"" he told reporters. Minority governments in Canada rarely last more than two years.
Together the Liberals and the Bloc, a separatist party rooted in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, would hold a clear majority of the 338 seats in the House of Commons.
On the other hand, Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-leaning New Democrat Party which shares many policy goals with the Liberals, said the speech did not win him over, though he stopped short of saying he would vote against it.
Finally, official opposition Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer signaled he would not support the government, saying he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the speech.
Trudeau focused on key campaign pledges, like fighting climate change, which he said was ""the defining challenge of our time,"" and on taking steps to introduce national coverage for prescription drugs, known as pharmacare.
Scheer said the prime minister failed to address the concerns of the western oil patch. Trudeau's Liberals did not win a seat in either Alberta or Saskatchewan, the heart of the struggling oil industry and home to the world's third-largest crude reserves. 
The government has not been able to accelerate the construction of pipelines needed to get the crude to international markets.
Scheer told reporters the speech ""was an insult to the people of Alberta and Saskatchewan.""

In the speech, Trudeau said his government would work hard to get resources to new markets ""and offer unwavering support to the hardworking women and men in Canada's natural resources sectors.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Party wrote to the head of the BBC on Thursday to complain about its coverage of campaigning ahead of next week's election, accusing the publicly-funded broadcaster of bias.
Labour’s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne said they had recorded numerous examples where his party's leadership had received ""more negative treatment, harsher scrutiny and slanted editorial comment"" than Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives.
""That bias has been reflected in the framing, content and balance of BBC reporting during the campaign,"" Gwynne wrote in a letter to the BBC's Director General Tony Hall.
""If the Conservatives are allowed to ‘play’ or manipulate the BBC, and this behavior goes unchecked, then the corporation will have effectively been complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage.""
The broadcaster, which is funded by a tax on all television-watching households and regularly faces accusations of bias from across the political spectrum, is bound by strict rules to ensure impartiality. 
""The BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favor,"" a BBC spokesman said.
Labour, trailing the Conservatives by about 10 points in opinion polls before the Dec. 12 vote, are particularly unhappy that Johnson has not agreed to be interviewed by veteran journalist Andrew Neil, who has already subjected the other major party leaders to tough questioning.
Labour said they had agreed to the Neil interview on the understanding that Johnson had also signed up.
""Instead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favorably and without the same degree of accountability,"" Gwynne said.
On Thursday, having just interviewed the head of the Brexit Party Nigel Farage on BBC TV at prime-time, Neil issued an on-air challenge to Johnson to appear before him. He also detailed a series of questions he would ask, focusing on whether Johnson could be trusted over campaign promises. 
""We have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, time, a venue. As of now, none has been forthcoming,"" Neil said, mocking Johnson by saying they had an interview which was ""oven-ready"", one of the phrases Johnson uses repeatedly to describe a Brexit deal agreed with the European Union.
Neil said any British prime minister would at times have to stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. ""So we're surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me.""
No one from the Conservative Party was immediately available for comment.
However, asked earlier about whether he would do an interview with Neil, Johnson said he would continue ""to submit to the interrogation of the media"".

""I’m the first prime minister to ... about to do  two one-on-one leadership debates, several hours’ worth of phone-ins, endless press conferences and interviews with all sorts of BBC people called Andrew,"" he told reporters.

Smalling and Lukaku, former Manchester United team mates, will be on opposite sides in the Serie A game.
The headline, in English, was posted in bold letters on the newspaper's front page along with a picture of the two black players.
Fare retweeted the headline under the comment: ""The media fuels racism every day. This is today's edition of Corriere dello Sport.""
In reply, the newspaper stood by its headline which it described as ""innocent"".
""'Black Friday', for those who want and can understand it, was and is only the praise of difference, the pride of difference, the magnificent richness of difference,"" it said in a message posted on its website.
""An innocent title... is transformed into poison by those who have the poison inside.""
Roma and AC Milan condemned the paper and took the decision to ban it from their training facilities for the rest of the year.
""Both clubs are aware that the actual newspaper article associated with the 'Black Friday' headline did portray an anti-racist message and for this reason, we have only banned Corriere dello Sport until January,"" Roma said in a joint statement https://www.asroma.com/en/news/2019/12/as-roma-and-ac-milan-issue-ban-to-corriere-dello-sport.
Lukaku said the paper had written ""the most dumbest of headlines I have ever seen in my career"".
""You guys keep fuelling the negativity and the racism issue.
Instead of talking about the beautiful game that's going to be played at San Siro between two great clubs,"" the Belgian said on Twitter.
Smalling also criticized the headline.
""Whilst I would have liked to spend the day focusing on the big game tomorrow, it is important that I acknowledge that what occurred this morning was wrong and highly insensitive,"" Smalling said on Twitter https://twitter.com/ChrisSmalling/status/1202636854249578497?s=20.
""I hope the editors involved in running this headline take responsibility and understand the power they possess through words, and the impact those words can have.""
Lukaku's agent Federico Pastorello said he was ""ashamed"" as an Italian to read that headline.
""Unfortunately, we are living in 1920. It's really a culture problem,"" Pastorello told Sky Sports.
MONKEY CHANTS
Italian football has been plagued by racism and Lukaku himself was a victim when the Belgium forward was insulted with monkey chants when he went to take a penalty for Inter Milan during a Serie A match at Cagliari.
A veteran Italian pundit was dropped from one of the country's Sunday night round table programs in September after suggesting Lukaku could only be stopped by giving him bananas to eat.
The president of Italian club Brescia said last month on the sidelines of a Serie A meeting that striker Mario Balotelli's problem was that he was ""black"", and he was ""trying to get whiter"".
All 20 Serie A clubs signed an open letter last week saying Italian football had to do more to fight racism.
Englishman Smalling, who joined Roma on loan from Manchester United, backed a campaign this year for players to boycott social media for 24 hours in a protest against racism."

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia must overhaul its complex and opaque justice system and do more to protect the rule of law if it wants to press its case to join the European Union, legal experts said in an EU-commissioned report on Thursday.
The divided Balkan country was suffering from dysfunctional institutions at all levels, and needed to stop political interference in judicial reforms, read the report by independent legal officials published in Brussels.
""Some key actors show no determination to address or overcome dysfunctionalities through coordination and cooperation,"" it said.
""Rather, they seem to do everything to obstruct any change that they consider not to be in their own interest.""
There was no immediate comment from the caretaker government, which has been caught up in months of political deadlock since elections last year.
Bosnia, along with five other Balkan nations - Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and North Macedonia - is trying to join the 28-nation political and trading group following the ethnic wars of the 1990s that led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia.
But the European Commission has said weaknesses in Bosnia's rule of law remains a ""fundamental problem"".
Its complex political structure compounded its problem and led to ""institutional overkill"", according to the experts report.
Bosnia includes two autonomous regions - the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic linked via a weak central government - as well as the neutral Brcko district and 10 cantons with a total of 14 different legal jurisdictions.
The report picked out the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC) - a judicial body meant to shield the judiciary from political influence - saying it had become part of the problem it was supposed to solve.
""The HJPC is often perceived by citizens and even by members of the judicial community as a center of unaccountable power in the hands of persons serving the interests of a network of political patronage and influence,"" the report said.
HJPC President Milan Tegeltija told the Bosnian web portal Klix.ba he agreed with parts of the report and disagreed with others, but would not comment further until he had read the whole paper.
The report also said the Ombudsman's office was ""deeply politicized"" and lacked independence.
The criminal justice system was failing to tackle corruption and other serious offences, while the civil system was overly complex and took too long to resolve cases, it added."

959,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 03:19PM ET</span>","'Tired, afraid, fed up': a grenade found in one Madrid social center hits a nerve","MADRID (Reuters) - A minors' reception center in Madrid became the focus for clashing views on immigration and social welfare on Thursday, after police defused a grenade found there a day earlier.
The row around the center, in the suburb of Hortaleza, crystallises worries over immigration and insecurity which helped the far-right Vox party double its result in last month's election to become the third-biggest bloc in parliament.
Vox repeatedly singled out the center during the campaign, with party leader Santiago Abascal denouncing ""criminal foreign youngsters"". Last month an extreme right-wing group called Hogar Social staged a protest at the gates, demanding the center's closure to restore ""security"".
Police have made no arrests and some officials say gang violence may also have been behind the incident - with the device likely thrown over the walls in a bag, according to Tedax, the Spanish police bomb squad. The grenade contained a minimal explosive charge, and no one was hurt.
But government spokeswoman Isabel Celaa said the inflammatory rhetoric from Vox, which staged a visit to the area by party spokeswoman Rocio Monasterio during the campaign, had created a dangerous climate.
""Words are ultimately internalized and intoxicate our consciences,"" she told reporters. ""We don't like these words, we believe they incite certain behaviors from citizens which are not desirable in a country which desires social cohesion and peace for all.""
With Spain's Socialist party still struggling to form a government after the election and separatist riots in Catalonia fresh in collective memory, Wednesday's incident has added to a volatile political climate in Spain.
The center houses around 90 youngsters, most from North Africa, as well as some Spaniards. Several residents appeared wary, although according to city authorities, Hortaleza has some of the lowest crime rates in Madrid.
""I don't feel safe passing by the center's gates alone,"" said 34-year-old receptionist Elizabeth Lopez-Vega, who said a young man she was told lived in the center had tried to steal her mobile phone last week.
""They need more social educators,"" she said. ""Nobody is integrating them into society and nobody is teaching them a thing.""
Social workers say the center is run down although it no longer suffers from the severe overcrowding it faced earlier this year, when minors were forced to sleep on the floor.
But they feel ""singled out, like a cross has been painted on our door,"" said one social worker, who asked to remain anonymous. ""We're tired, afraid, and fed up."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iranian security forces may have killed more than 1,000 people since protests over gasoline price hikes began in mid-November, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook said on Thursday, adding that many thousands were also wounded in the unrest.
""As the truth is trickling out of Iran, it appears the regime could have murdered over a thousand Iranian citizens since the protests began,"" Hook told reporters at a briefing at the State Department.
Among those were at least a dozen children, Hook said, but cautioned that the numbers were not definitive as Tehran blocked information. He said that ""many thousands of Iranians"" had also been wounded and at least 7,000 detained in Iran's prisons.
The unrest, which began on Nov. 15 after the Iranian government abruptly raised fuel prices by as much as 300%, spread to more than 100 cities and towns and turned political as young and working-class protesters demanded clerical leaders step down.
Tehran has given no official death toll but Amnesty International said on Monday it had documented the deaths of at least 208 protesters, making the disturbances the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Tehran’s clerical rulers have blamed “thugs” linked to its opponents in exile and the country’s main foreign foes - the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia - for the unrest.
The struggle of ordinary Iranians to make ends meet has become harder since last year, when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with six world powers and reimposed sanctions that have further crippled Iran's oil-based economy.
Hook also said a U.S. Navy warship seizing advanced missile parts believed to be linked to Iran from a boat it stopped in the Arabian Sea on Nov. 25 was likely further proof of Tehran's efforts to inflame conflict in the region.
""We interdicted a significant hoard of weapons and missile parts evidently of Iranian origin. The seizure includes sophisticated weapons,"" he said, adding that the vessel was reportedly heading to Yemen to deliver the weapons.
""The weapon components comprise the most sophisticated weapons seized by the U.S. Navy to date during the Yemen conflict,"" Hook said.
In recent years, U.S. warships have intercepted and seized Iranian arms likely bound for Iran-aligned Houthi fighters.

Under a United Nations resolution, Tehran is prohibited from supplying, selling or transferring weapons outside the country unless approved by the Security Council. A separate U.N. resolution on Yemen bans the supply of weapons to Houthi leaders.

(Reuters) - The Supreme Court of Canada on Thursday declined to hear the appeal of an ex-Nazi death squad member to restore his Canadian citizenship, which was revoked after the Canadian government learned of his wartime activities.
Helmut Oberlander, 95, was born in Ukraine and became a German citizen during World War Two, serving first as a translator for Nazi death squads and later as an infantryman in the German army, court documents from 2018 state.
""He was found to have significantly misrepresented his wartime activities to Canadian immigration and citizenship officials when he applied to enter Canada"" in 1952, according to the Supreme Court's case summary.
He obtained Canadian citizenship in 1960 and was initially stripped of it in 1995, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began an investigation into his involvement in war crimes.
Oberlander has testified he was forced to join one of the Nazis' Einsatzkommando mobile killing squads at age 17, and did not take part in any atrocities, the court documents from 2018 show.
The government did not find proof of conscription, according to court documents.
The squads murdered a total of more than 2 million people in eastern Europe, most of them Jewish people, Reuters previously reported.
Oberlander's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Canadian government was ""pleased"" with the Supreme Court's decision, Nancy Caron, spokeswoman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, said in an email.
The government is ""determined to deny safe haven in Canada to war criminals and persons believed to have committed or been complicit in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide,"" Caron added.
Edit Kuper, co-president of the Canadian Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Descendants, said the Supreme Court made the right decision. The government had attempted to revoke Oberlander's citizenship three times prior and been rejected by the courts each time until its latest attempt.
""We are pained by the thought that there are still Nazi war criminals who conceal their past and live among us,"" Kuper said in a statement.
The Supreme Court did not provide reasons for its dismissal of Oberlander's application for leave to appeal his citizenship revocation."

OSLO/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will not talk to the news media when he is in Oslo next week to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing rare criticism from the award committee, which says a free and independent press is vital. 
The Ethiopian leader won the prize in October for his peacemaking efforts which ended two decades of hostility with longtime enemy Eritrea.
Nobel Peace Prize laureates traditionally hold a news conference a day before the official ceremony on Dec. 10. But Abiy has told the Norwegian Nobel Committee he will not do so.
Neither will Abiy take questions from reporters after his meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, nor will he participate at an event with children celebrating peace held every year at the Nobel Peace Center, a museum.
That drew rare criticism from the secretive award committee, composed of Norwegian politicians and academics, which tends to refrain from commenting on past laureates. 
Asked whether it was problematic that Abiy was not holding a news conference, Olav Njoelstad, Secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said: ""Yes, we would very much have wanted him to engage with the press during his stay in Oslo.""
""We strongly believe that freedom of expression and a free and independent press are vital components of peace,"" he told Reuters. 
""Moreover, some former Nobel Peace Prize laureates have received the prize in recognition of their efforts in favor of these very rights and freedoms,"" said Njoelstad. 
He added that the committee's position had been made ""very clear to the Prime Minister and his staff"". 
Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have attended the ceremony but not given a news conference include U.S. President Barack Obama, when he received the award in 2009. 
Abiy will still meet Prime Minister Erna Solberg, as well as King Harald V, and visit the Norwegian Parliament. 
He will also deliver the Nobel lecture at Oslo City Hall on Dec. 10, the day of the ceremony and the anniversary of the death of the Nobel Prizes founder, Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel. 
Abiy's spokeswoman said the PM had to make priorities given the ""extensive program"" and his responsibilities back home. 
""It is quite challenging for a sitting Head of State to dedicate that many days, particularly where domestic issues are pressing and warrant attention,"" Billene Seyoum told Reuters. 
""Therefore, the Prime Minister will be attending essential and prioritized programs, agreed upon in consultation with the Nobel Institute, to honor and respect the Nobel tradition.""

""At a personal level, the humble disposition of the Prime Minister rooted in our cultural context is not in alignment with the very public nature of the Nobel award,"" she added.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Albania's parliament elected Olsian Çela as prosecutor general on Thursday as part of judicial reforms sought by the West that are intended to kick out corrupt judges.
The European Union has told Albania the reforms must remain a top priority if it wants to join the bloc and the judiciary should have teeth in the fight against corruption and crime.
In a process monitored by European and U.S. experts, 800 Albanian judges and prosecutors will be vetted in order to flush out corrupt judicial officials and end impunity for politicians. So far, most Supreme and Constitutional Court judges have been fired, prompting many Albanians to say they were right to view the judiciary as corrupt. However, the opposition says the government is trying to exert undue control over the reformed judicial system.
""We welcome the election by the parliament of Mr. Olsian Çela as General Prosecutor,"" said Luigi Soreca, the EU's ambassador to Albania.
As the crime-ridden Balkan nation aspires to join the European Union, Çela will have his work cut out, as the Albanian public, Western partners, the government and opposition are all calling for action against corruption.
Authorities are also investigating whether builders added unlicensed storeys to dwellings toppled by an earthquake that killed 51 people nine days ago.
Çela, 44, speaks four languages and has been trained in Europe and the United States on how to fight organized crime."

PRISTINA (Reuters) - A court in Kosovo has sentenced a lawmaker who once served as a government minister to two years in jail for denying a massacre by Serb forces in 1999 which prompted NATO's intervention to halt the war.
Ivan Todosijevic was serving as a minister in the Pristina government in March this year when he described NATO as an aggressor, declared the ""Racak massacre was fabricated"" and called Albanians ""terrorists"".
Serbs killed 44 Albanians in the village of Racak in 1999 before NATO went to war to drive Serb forces out of Kosovo, ending a counter-insurgency war in which more than 13,000 people, mainly local Albanians, were killed.
Kosovo's 90-percent ethnic Albanian majority praises NATO for halting the war, a development that paved the way to independence in 2008.
In the ruling the judge said Todosijevic's remarks, during a commemoration of the start of the NATO bombing, ""intentionally incited and publicly promoted hatred, division and intolerance among national, racial and ethnic groups living in Kosovo.""
Todosijevic's lawyer said his client, who was subsequently dismissed from his job as a minister because of his comments, would appeal against the verdict.
""The verdict is a proof that human rights are being violated in Kosovo. My client is sentenced for something which is not even considered a criminal act,"" lawyer Nebojsa Vlajic told Serb media.
Serb President Aleksandar Vucic said the verdict was ""terrifying"".
Kosovo has been recognized by more than 110 states but not by five EU member states, Serbia and Russia.
Serbia's former southern province, Kosovo is still seen by Serbia as part of its territory. Many Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their nation and Orthodox Christian faith.
Todosijevic comes from the Serb minority which accounts for about 5 percent of the country’s population of 1.8 million. Serbs in Kosovo refuse to accept Kosovo's statehood.
After 78 days of bombing, under the terms of an armistice, former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ordered his troops to withdraw from Kosovo and be replaced with NATO control.
Less than 4,000 NATO peacekeepers are still deployed."

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru and Washington are in the final stages of talks on a deal to promote American investments in the South American country as part of a U.S. initiative to counter Chinese influence in the region, a Peruvian diplomat told Reuters.
The United States launched its ""Growth in the Americas"" initiative in 2018 to bolster private-sector investments in energy and infrastructure in Latin America after China invited countries in the region to join its global Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
So far, the United States has signed memorandums of understanding within the Growth in the Americas framework with Argentina, Chile, Jamaica and Panama. Chile, Jamaica, Panama and Peru have also signed MOUs with China to join the BRI.
""The Trump administration is interested in balancing Chinese influence in the region a bit,"" Cecilia Galarreta, the director of North American affairs in Peru's foreign ministry, told Reuters on the sidelines of an event on Thursday.
Galarreta said the draft MOU with Washington to join the Growth in the Americas initiative was now being evaluated in the energy and mines ministry and the finance ministry.
China replaced the United States as Peru's top trade partner years ago and Chinese companies are increasingly investing in infrastructure projects in the Andean country.
""We've had meetings with delegations from the United States that have strongly insisted on the importance of the greater presence of North American companies investing here, especially in infrastructure,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Jaime Pomareda told Reuters on the sidelines of the same event.

U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters the United States was considering sending thousands of additional troops to the Middle East to deter Iran, but that no decision had been made and the situation remained fluid.
The officials cited intelligence over the past month indicating that Iran had been repositioning forces and weapons.
The Pentagon on Wednesday strongly denied a Wall Street Journal report that the United States was considering sending 14,000 additional troops to the region.
Lawmakers on Thursday pressed John Rood, the Pentagon's No. 3 official, on whether additional troops were being considered for the Middle East.
""Based on what we're seeing with our concerns about the threat picture, it is possible that we would need to adjust our force posture,"" Rood said.
""We are always considering and in fact, based on the threat situation in the Middle East are watching that, and as necessary the secretary of defense has told me he intends to make changes to our force posture there,"" Rood said.
Lawmakers appeared frustrated by Rood's answers. Republican Senator Josh Hawley said he wanted to hear from Defense Secretary Mark Esper.
""I'd like to hear from him today on this issue ... I'd like to have it in public because the Pentagon has now made multiple contradictory public statements,"" Hawley said.
The United States has already dispatched about 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East since May, backed by bombers and air defense personnel, to act as a deterrent against what Washington says is provocative Iranian behavior.
The Pentagon's openness to deploying additional troops is unsurprising, given regular planning meant to address potential spikes in tensions with Iran, which is struggling with U.S. sanctions and street protests.
Iranian security forces may have killed more than 1,000 people since the protests over gasoline price hikes began in mid-November, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook said on Thursday, in what would mark the bloodiest disturbances since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Tensions have risen in the Gulf since attacks on oil tankers during the summer, including off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, and a major assault on energy facilities in Saudi Arabia. The United States has blamed Iran, which has denied being behind the attacks on global energy infrastructure."

WARSAW (Reuters) - Angela Merkel will make her first visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial on Friday after 14 years as German chancellor, bringing a 60 million euro donation to help conserve the site where the Nazis ran their largest death camp, the museum said.
Merkel has not shied away from admitting German responsibility for its atrocities in World War Two, but her visit will ensure she follows in the footsteps of former chancellors by seeing the site before her term ends.
""Auschwitz is a museum but is also the biggest cemetery in the world ... (memory) is the key to building the present and future,"" museum director Piotr Cywinski told Reuters ahead of Merkel's visit at the invitation of the Auschwitz foundation.
Merkel will announce the donation, half of which comes from Germany's federal government and half from the regional governments, at a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation.
The money will cement Germany's place as the largest donor to the foundation, which funds the conservation efforts for the site where more than 1 million people died in what was then Nazi-occupied Poland.
More than 3 million of Poland's 3.2 million Jews were killed by the Nazis, accounting for about half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust.
The money will ensure that the conservation of 30 brick barracks in the Birkenau camp site, including an old kitchen and latrine, for example, can continue.
""Many of the buildings were not built to last long,"" Cywinski said, adding that the foundation needs between 18 million zlotys to 20 million zlotys ($4.62 million to $5.13 million) annually to maintain conservation.
""I want to show that these funds are created as a tool for the future, for the next generation, for education. It's not a way to point the finger at a country's history, because that's not my role.""
The proceeds from the foundation's fund, which relies on payouts from bonds and was opened a decade ago, proved to be lower than hoped in part due to the financial crisis in 2009.
Cywinski, who had also considered riskier stock market investments, appealed to donor countries for more support two years ago. Germany is the only country that has responded to date. The United States and Poland have previously been big donors.
Merkel has previously visited other concentration camp sites and met survivors of Auschwitz."

Measles infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children, as devastating outbreaks of the viral disease hit every region of the world, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.
In figures described by its director general as ""an outrage"", the WHO said most of last year's measles deaths were in children under five years old who had not been vaccinated.
""The fact that any child dies from a vaccine-preventable disease like measles is frankly an outrage and a collective failure to protect the world's most vulnerable children,"" said the WHO's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus.
The picture for 2019 is even worse, the WHO said, with provisional data up to November showing a three-fold increase compared with the same period in 2018.
The United States has already reported its highest number of measles cases in 25 years in 2019, while four countries in Europe - Albania, the Czech Republic, Greece and Britain – lost their WHO ""measles-free"" status in 2018 after suffering large outbreaks.
An ongoing outbreak of measles in South Pacific nation of Samoa has infected more than 4,200 people and killed more than 60, mostly babies and children, in a battle complicated by a vocal anti-vaccination movement.
Globally, measles vaccination rates have stagnated for almost a decade, the WHO said. It and the UNICEF children's fund say that in 2018, around 86% of children got a first dose of measles vaccine through their country's routine vaccination services, and fewer than 70% got the second dose recommended to fully protect them from measles infection.
HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS
Measles is one of the most contagious known diseases - more so than Ebola, tuberculosis or flu. It can linger in the air or on surfaces for several hours after an infected person has been and gone - putting anyone not vaccinated at risk.
In some wealthier nations, vaccination rates have been hit by some parents shunning them for what they say are religious or philosophical reasons. Mistrust of authority and debunked myths about links to autism also weaken vaccine confidence and lead some parents to delay protecting their children.
Research published in October showed that measles infection not only carries a risk of death or severe complications including pneumonia, brain damage, blindness and deafness, but can also damage the victim's immune memory for months or years - leaving those who survive measles vulnerable to other dangerous diseases such as flu or severe diarrhea.
The WHO data showed there were an estimated 9,769,400 cases of measles and 142,300 related deaths globally in 2018. This compares to 7,585,900 cases and 124,000 deaths in 2017.
In 2018, measles hit hardest in Liberia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Somalia and Ukraine, the WHO said, with these five nations accounting for nearly half of global cases.
Robert Linkins, a specialist at the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said the data were worrying: ""Without improving measles vaccine coverage we're going to continue to see these needless deaths. We must turn this trend around."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Seventy serving and former officials in Britain's main opposition Labour Party have made critical submissions to an independent inquiry investigating alleged anti-Semitism in the party.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission announced in May that it would look into whether the party may have discriminated or harassed people because they are Jewish.
The Jewish Labour Movement, which is affiliated to the Labour party, has now released details of its submissions to the Commission.
They include one respondent who listed 22 examples of anti-Semitic abuse at party meetings where he was called a “child killer” and ""Tory Jew"". 
A parliamentary candidate describes witnessing a party member tell a Jewish councillor to go home and count their money after they were deselected. 
Another party worker said a colleague objected to the prospective membership of 25 ultra-Orthodox Jews, and visits were made to their homes - something that did not happen for other applicants.
Labour said in a statement in response to the claims that the party is not institutionally anti-Semitic, the complaints relate to a small minority of members, and that the processes to deal with such allegations have now improved.
Polls show Labour trailing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives ahead of next week's general election but a recent narrowing of the lead has raised the prospect of an inconclusive result where a Labour-led minority government takes charge of the world's fifth-largest economy.
Labour has been battling accusations of anti-Semitism for the past two years. Nine lawmakers quit the party this year citing the leadership’s handling of anti-Semitism in the party, as well as its Brexit stance, as their reason for leaving.
Israel's foreign minister said on Thursday that he hopes Labour loses the election, citing allegations of anti-Semitism in the party.
The submission by the Jewish Labour Movement alleges there was political interference in the disciplinary process by Corbyn’s office, despite Labour’s insistence that the leadership has not got involved.
One former member of staff claimed in a submission that they were instructed to deliver details of cases under investigation on USB sticks to the leader’s office.
A Labour party spokeswoman disputed the allegations, saying a former staffer would not know how the party's procedures currently work, after reforms.

The equality commission said in a statement: ""We are unable to comment on the detail of this investigation as it is live and ongoing. We can, however, confirm that it will not be concluded before the end of the year.”

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Thursday rejected pressure to shelve its ballistic missile program after a European letter to the U.N. Security Council accused Tehran of developing missiles capable of being delivering nuclear bombs.
The British, German and French ambassadors to the U.N. Security Council, in a letter circulated on Wednesday, called on U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to inform the Council in his next report that Iran’s missile program was “inconsistent” with a U.N. resolution underpinning the 2015 nuclear deal reached between Iran and six world powers.
Iran responded defiantly, saying it was determined to proceed with its disputed ballistic missile program, which it has repeatedly described as defensive in purpose and nothing to do with its nuclear activity.
""Iran is determined to resolutely continue its activities related to ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles,"" Iranian U.N. envoy Majid Takhte Ravanchi said in a letter to Guterres. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had earlier on Thursday denounced the European powers' intervention.
""Latest E3 letter to UNSG on missiles is a desperate falsehood to cover up their miserable incompetence in fulfilling bare minimum of their own #JCPOA obligations,"" Zarif tweeted, referring to the nuclear deal by its formal acronym. He urged Britain, France and Germany not to bow to ""U.S. bullying"".
The European letter surfaced at a time of heightened friction between Iran and the West, with Tehran rolling back its commitments under the deal step by step in response to Washington’s pullout from the pact last year and reimposition of sanctions on the Islamic Republic that has crippled its economy. 
A 2015 U.N. resolution ""called upon"" Iran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles that could be capable of delivering nuclear warheads. 
Some states - including Russia, which with four other world powers wields a veto on the Security Council - argue that the language does not make it obligatory.
France said on Thursday that Iran's ballistic missile activities did not conform with the Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to respect all of its obligations under that resolution.
The Security Council is due to meet on Dec. 20 to weight the state of compliance with the resolution underpinning the nuclear deal, and the European letter ""will add to that discussion,"" a senior European diplomat told Reuters. 
Britain, France and Germany have sought to salvage the nuclear pact, under which Iran undertook to curtail its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from sanctions. But Tehran has criticized the three European powers for failing to shield Iran's economy from the U.S. penalties. 

The United States, Iran's arch foe, and its allies in the Middle East view Tehran’s ballistic missile program as a Middle East security threat.

The law enacted last month extends the blackout on publishing polls on voting intentions to 50 days from the already lengthy 14 days, giving Slovakia the third-longest ban of its kind in the world after Cameroon and Tunisia, according to the Slovak Academy of Sciences.
The measure was adopted ahead of an election due on Feb. 29 next year with the votes of the ruling leftist Smer party, junior coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) and the opposition far-right People's Party-Our Slovakia.
Its authors said the bill aimed to protect voters from disinformation so they could base their decisions on the parties' programs and actions.
Opposition critics said the measure, which follows a bill tightening the financing rules for new parties, was aimed at disadvantaging challengers from new parties that could benefit from late shifts in support.
In her motion filed with the court, President Zuzana Caputova argued that the bill violates the right to information and that it limited political competition.
The Constitutional Court may put the implementation of the ban on hold before Jan. 10 -- the deadline for publication of polls under the 50-day blackout -- until a final ruling that is likely to follow later.
The bill does not ban parties from procuring their own opinion polls, as long as they keep the information out of the public domain, but it imposes fines of up to 10,000 euros on publishers for releasing polls during the blackout.
Slovakia, like other countries in Europe, has seen a rise in new parties in recent years.
Caputova, an activist lawyer and political newcomer herself, defeated Smer's candidate in a presidential runoff in March after a late surge in support.

The unrest, the worst faced by Chile since it emerged from dictatorship in 1990, has left at least 26 dead and caused more than $1.5 billion in business losses, devastating the economy.
Though protests have simmered down in recent weeks, the damage to streets, squares and the metro remain. Traffic is regularly snarled at downtown intersections that now have no stop lights and where motorists must fend for themselves.
Cycling has emerged as the obvious solution, says Tomas Echiburu, a researcher with the Urban Development Center at Chile's Universidad Catolica.
""Before the crisis ... 450 cyclists per hour passed through here at peak commute,"" he said. ""Immediately after the crisis, that quantity has doubled, to 900 per hour.""
Bikes now outnumber cars at many intersections during rush hour, and cyclists in shiny new Spandex gear and fluorescent helmets are seen zipping down tree-lined bike lanes throughout much of the business district.
""Since the crisis began, the streets have filled with [cyclists],"" said 60-year-old Ana Guzman as she pedaled to work at a local healthcare center. ""Before, you could walk peacefully, but now it's all congested.""
Local bicycle shops have reaped the benefits.
""Sales have taken off,"" said Jorge Arancibia, a local shop owner. ""People need to get around and so they've either dug out their old bike or bought a new one."""

The Supreme Court ruled in September that Milan Mazurek from the far-right People's Party-Our Slovakia (LSNS) committed a crime by expressing comments aimed at the Roma minority and imposed a fine on him.
Fico released a video message in which he supported Mazurek, who had said: ""The Gypsy anti-socials have never done anything for the nation and never will,"" and compared Roma children to ""animals in the zoo"".
Fico could face a prison term of one to five years if found guilty of approving a crime and defaming nation, race and belief as well as inciting national, race and ethnic hatred, police said in a statement.
""Milan Mazurek said what almost the whole nation thinks and if you execute someone for truth, you make him a national hero,"" Fico said in the message, originally released on his official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page in September.
""If the Supreme Court ruling were to be the benchmark of what is a crime in addressing the Roma, then the investigatory bodies can enter any pub in Slovakia and lock up all the guests,"" he said.
The far-right LSNS is viewed as a possible coalition partner for Fico's Smer party after a general election on Feb. 29, given that LSNS has recently backed a number of Smer bills in the parliament. Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, however, has ruled out such coalition.
Smer, a Social Democrat, socially conservative party, has been losing support since the 2018 murder of a journalist who investigated links between the underworld and the government, but still remains the most popular party.
Fico resigned under pressure from public demonstrations after the murder but has kept his three-party coalition in government by installing party ally Pellegrini as prime minister.
According to 2013 data from the Labour Ministry and the United Nations, there are about 400,000 Roma among Slovakia's population of 5.4 million, which makes them the second biggest minority after ethnic Hungarians. Many of them live in segregated townships without sewage and running water, facing discrimination at schools and in the workplace."

Netanyahu was questioned by police but is not a suspect in the long-running investigation into suspicions that the local agent for the vessels' builder, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) Marine Systems, part of the Thyssenkrupp group, paid bribes to Israeli officials.
Thyssenkrupp has said an internal probe found no evidence of corruption in its handling of the 2016 contract for the sale of three submarines to Israel, and Israeli prosecutors have taken no action against the conglomerate.
In a statement, the Justice Ministry said prosecutors accepted recommendations police made last year to indict Netanyahu's attorney David Shimron, the prime minister's ex-chief of staff David Sharan, Admiral Eliezer Marom and Israeli businessman Miki Ganor, who was Thyssenkrupp's local agent.
Pending pre-trial hearings, Shimron will be charged with money laundering. Sharan, Marom and Ganor will face that charge as well as bribery, the ministry said.
All the suspects have denied any wrongdoing.
The submarine deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that Shimron, Netanyahu's personal lawyer, also represented Ganor, raising concerns of a conflict of interest.
Fighting for his political life after two inconclusive elections, Netanyahu has been indicted in three corruption probes unrelated to the submarine investigation. He has denied any wrongdoing in those cases."

SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on military force and the North's leader, Kim Jong Un, would represent ""a very dangerous challenge"" if they were intended to provoke Pyongyang, a top North Korean diplomat said on Thursday.
Trump's comments threaten to return the two countries to the tensions of two years ago, Choe Son Hui, first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs for North Korea, said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.
In 2017 the two leaders famously engaged in a war of words, with Trump calling Kim ""Rocket Man"" and North Korea slamming the U.S. president, now 73, as a ""dotard"".
Since then Trump and Kim have met three times, but negotiations over North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenal have stalled amid disagreements and rising tensions.
This year saw a number of short-range ballistic missile launches by North Korea, and Kim has warned that the United States has until the end of the year to change its stance or he could take an unspecified ""new path.""
On Tuesday Trump once again called Kim ""Rocket Man"" and said the United States reserved the right to use military force against North Korea.
""If this is meant to make expressions, reminiscent of those days just two years ago when a war of words was fought across the ocean, surface again on purpose, it will be a very dangerous challenge,"" Choe said, arguing that the comments aroused concern and undermined the dignity of North Korea's leader.
The lack of courtesy shown to Kim had ""prompted the waves of hatred of our people against the U.S. and the Americans and they are getting higher and higher"", Choe said.
""It would be fortunate"" if Trump's remarks were simply ""an instantaneous verbal lapse, but the matter becomes different if they were a planned provocation that deliberately targeted us"", she said.
North Korea would watch closely to see if Trump repeated the comments, Choe said.
""If any language and expressions stoking the atmosphere of confrontation are used once again on purpose at a crucial moment as now, that must really be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a dotard,"" she concluded.
Trump said on Tuesday he still had confidence in the North Korean leader but noted that Kim ""likes sending rockets up"".
""...That's why I call him Rocket Man,"" Trump told reporters at a NATO meeting in London.
Trump added that Washington could use military force. “If we have to, we’ll do it.”

On Wednesday, North Korea's army chief said he was disappointed by Trump's suggestion of using military force against Pyongyang, and warned that any strike would meet ""prompt corresponding actions"".

The names of the gunman and his victims have not been released to the public. The gunman was described by a witness as wearing a Navy uniform during the attack, and the civilians were at the base working for the Department of Defense, Navy officials said.
The shooting took place three days before the 78th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack on Dec. 7, 1941, which led the United States to declare war on Japan and enter World War Two.
A third person who was wounded was in a stable condition at a hospital on Wednesday night, military officials said.
Navy officials were still piecing together the attack on Wednesday night, saying it was unclear if the gunman knew his victims. Officials said they were still confirming the type of weapon used as of Wednesday night, noting that people were forbidden from bringing personal weapons onto the base.
The Pearl Harbor base is about eight miles (13 km) from the state capital of Honolulu. It was placed on lockdown for about two hours after the incident at about 2:30 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time on Wednesday."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong authorities granted protesters permission to march this weekend, organizers said on Thursday, giving the green light to a rally seen as a gauge of the pro-democracy movement's support following its sweeping victory in local elections.
The Civil Human Rights Front, the group that organized million-strong marches in the China-ruled city in June, said it had received permission from police for a planned Human Rights Day rally on Sunday.
During the past six months of increasingly violent anti-Beijing demonstrations, authorities had denied requests from the group to hold rallies. Some calm has descended since the Nov. 24 district elections, when pro-democracy candidates won nearly 90% of the seats.
The protests were sparked by a controversial extradition bill, since withdrawn, and have swelled into broader calls for greater democratic freedoms. The months of unrest have posed the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
A motion to remove the city's Beijing-backed chief executive, Carrie Lam, failed to pass in Hong Kong's Legislative Council on Thursday, as it was rejected by pro-Beijing lawmakers, local broadcaster RTHK said.
Thirty-six lawmakers voted against the impeachment motion while 26 voted for it, RTHK said. While backing Lam, the leader of the biggest pro-Beijing party also criticized her administration, saying it had been unable to prevent ""violence unleashed by rioters"", the broadcaster said.
SHOOTING INCIDENT
Separately, a protester who was shot by police in an altercation two months ago appeared in court for the first time to face charges of rioting and assaulting a police officer.
Tsang Chi-kin, who had been hospitalized after the October shooting, walked into a Hong Kong court and left about an hour later after his case was adjourned until February. 
An officer shot Tsang in the chest with a live round. Police said the officer involved was under serious threat and acted in self-defense. 
Police say they have exercised restraint in the face of escalating violence, but they are facing accusations of excessive use of force.
A rally has been planned for Friday evening to protest against the use of tear gas by police.
Demonstrators have repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into police use of force as one of their ""five demands"". The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has also called for an investigation into allegations of excessive police force.
Hong Kong's Commissioner of Police Chris Tang will visit Beijing on Friday to discuss the security situation, his first such visit since his appointment last month.
Tang will pay a ""courtesy visit"" to Beijing, where he will call on the Ministry of Public Security, meet with counterparts and discuss the security situation, the Hong Kong government said in a statement.
He is due to return early on Sunday morning, according to police, hours before the afternoon rally.
Tang took office in November with a warning that ""fake news"" was undermining the reputation of his police force. 
He replaced Stephen Lo amid an police siege of anti-government protesters at a university that saw some of the worst violence of the protests.
Tang has called for people across Hong Kong to end the unrest that has plunged the city into its biggest political crisis in decades.

Protesters accuse China of increasingly interfering in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering in Hong Kong's affairs.

The move reduces the risk of a political crisis in Europe's largest economy after Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, two leftist critics of the coalition with Merkel's conservatives, won an SPD leadership ballot last week.
In their motion for the SPD congress that starts on Friday the new SPD leaders suggest entering negotiations with Merkel's CDU/CSU conservative bloc on more public investments, a higher minimum wage and more ambitious steps to protect the climate, two party board members told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A draft of the main motion seen by Reuters showed that SPD leaders are set to call for a big public investment push that should not be hindered by ""dogmatic positions"" such as the government's ""black zero"" budget policy of no net new debt.
The motion calls for a higher minimum wage, without repeating previous demands from Esken and Walter-Borjans for an immediate rise to 12 euros from 9.19 euros per hour currently.
In the latest version of the draft, the SPD leaders suggest the minimum wage should increase to 12 euros in the medium term."

More than one month since Saad al-Hariri resigned as prime minister in the face of mass protests against Lebanon's ruling elite, Sunni businessman Samir Khatib appears on course to be designated as the new premier in formal consultations on Monday.
Lebanon's long-brewing economic crisis has grown more acute since protests began on Oct. 17, spiraling into a financial crunch that led banks to impose informal capital controls as dollars became scarce and the local currency weakened.
The designation of a new prime minister, who must be a Sunni Muslim according to Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, will be followed by talks to form the new government that is expected to include technocrats and politicians.
A senior political source said once Khatib is designated, the cabinet was expected to be formed quickly because major parties had already reached an agreement on its make-up.
Aoun, speaking during a meeting with heads of professional syndicates, said the new government's priorities would include ""achieving the essential reforms in different sectors"" and fighting corruption, a statement from the presidency said.
Prospects of a prime minister being designated helped the Lebanese pound to strengthen. Dollars were being offered on a parallel market at 1,980 pounds compared to 2,030 pounds on Wednesday, a dealer said. The official rate is 1,507.5 pounds.
Lebanon's economic crisis is rooted in decades of state waste and corruption that have made it one of the world's most heavily indebted states.
A U.S. official, addressing a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, noted that more than $11 billion in financing had been pledged to Lebanon last year in Paris if it acts seriously on reform.
""But there is no Western country that is going to jump in there and say 'we are going to bail you out this time once again even though you haven't gotten the message from your people and even though you haven't committed to reform',"" said Joey Hood, principal deputy assistant secretary at the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.
Efforts to agree a new government have been mired in political differences between Hariri, who is aligned with Western and Gulf Arab states, and the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies, including Aoun.
Hezbollah, which had more influence in the Hariri-led cabinet than in any previous administration, has accused the United States of meddling in the formation of a new Lebanese government. It had backed Hariri's return."

Ahead of Wednesday's summit, Turkey had angered other NATO members by saying it would block the defense plan until they designated the Kurdish YPG militia, against which Ankara waged a military offensive two months ago, a terrorist organization.
Speaking to reporters in London, Erdogan said that Turkey dropped its objection to the Baltics plan after NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg and the leaders of Germany, France and Poland asked for Turkey's backing.
""They all called us and asked us for support on this. After talks with my colleagues, we said yes to this, but you must not abandon us in the fight against terror,"" broadcaster NTV quoted Erdogan as saying. 
Stoltenberg told reporters after the summit that allies had not discussed how to designate the YPG during their talks.
Ties between Turkey and its NATO allies have soured over a host of issues, ranging from Ankara's decision to procure Russian air defense systems to Syria policy. Ankara accuses its allies of not providing enough support against the threats it is facing and in hosting more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees.
Turkey says it aims to establish a ""safe zone"" in part of northeast Syria after clearing the region of the YPG, and says that Syrian refugees can be settled there. 
Erdogan has also urged allies to provide funds for its plans, which he discussed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the summit.

Erdogan said that only one country, which he did not name, has so far pledged support for Turkey's Syria plans. He said the four leaders had agreed to meet again in Istanbul in February and to hold talks annually.

VALLETTA (Reuters) - A wealthy businessman, who is the prime suspect in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, told a Malta court on Thursday he got regular tip-offs about the investigation from the government's ex-chief of staff.
Yorgen Fenech, who was charged last week for allegedly being a mastermind in the 2017 killing of Caruana Galizia, appeared in court to seek the removal of the police chief leading the case, saying he was too close to former chief of staff Keith Schembri.
His testimony in a packed courtroom piled pressure on Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who is a friend of Schembri, and raised further questions about possible government involvement in attempts to cover-up a crime that shocked the European Union.
Schembri resigned last week and was briefly arrested in connection with the investigation. He was released without charge and has denied any wrongdoing.
Fenech has denied accusations of complicity in the murder and has instead blamed his close friend Schembri, who was Muscat's righthand man and the architect of his two electoral victories. Muscat has said he will stand down next month after his party elects a new leader.
Fenech said Schembri had passed on information from briefings that chief investigator Keith Arnaud gave at Muscat's office. This meant he knew swiftly about key breaks, including that his own phone had been tapped, Fenech said.
Schembri's lawyer did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment on Fenech's testimony on Thursday. 
A police source has told Reuters that investigators believed a mole had been passing on information to the suspects, including to three men caught in 2017 and later charged with carrying out the car bombing that killed Caruana Galizia.
""The information used to be relayed by Keith Arnaud himself. Schembri used to say that he had a good relationship with Arnaud who kept him abreast with latest developments,"" Fenech said.
IMMUNITY
Arnaud made no immediate comment but the police last week issued a statement saying there was no reason for his removal and that the investigation was proving effective.
Fenech did not address the murder allegations leveled against himself and is due back in court on Dec. 10.
But Fenech said that following his arrest, Schembri managed to pass him notes on two occasions telling him what to say in the interrogations. 
But he ignored the advice and instead implicated Schembri. At that point, he said police rushed to charge him and skated over the allegations he was making. 
""But all the recordings and evidence link Schembri with the murderers,"" he said.
The self-confessed middleman in the murder, Melvin Theuma, who has been given legal immunity in return for providing evidence, told a court on Wednesday that Fenech was the sole mastermind behind the killing.

Caruana Galizia was a campaigning journalist who regularly accused government ministers and business leaders of corruption. Theuma said Fenech wanted her dead because she was going to publish an incriminating story about his uncle.

The loaded vessel, the Nave Constellation, was attacked 77 nautical miles off Bonny Island on Tuesday and 18 Indians and one Turk from the crew were seized, the official said.
Seven other crew members remain on board the vessel. Neither the vessel nor the cargo were damaged, the official said.
The shipping industry has warned in recent months about the increasing dangers faced by seafarers sailing through the Gulf of Guinean, particularly around Nigeria, including kidnappings by pirate gangs.
The International Maritime Bureau said in October the Gulf of Guinea accounted for more than four fifths of crew kidnappings globally.
Maritime security officials say that over the past year there has been a growing shift by pirate gangs in the Gulf of Guinea and especially Nigeria toward kidnapping crews rather than stealing cargoes, aiming to extract ransom from ship owners for crews being held and subjected to violence. 
The Hong Kong-flagged supertanker, capable of carrying up to 2 million barrels of oil, is operated by Greek shipping company Navios Tankers Management.
""We are doing everything necessary to make sure that the 19 crew members will return safe,"" the official at Navios said, adding that their families have been informed.
An Indian government source said its mission in Nigeria had taken up the matter of the kidnappings with the Nigerian government and security agencies. 
The vessel was carrying crude for Indian refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp, a source at the company said.
The vessel was chartered by French oil company Total to deliver Bonny Light oil at Vizag in southern India, the source said.
""Total has told us it would arrange alternative crew to get the cargo delivered on time,"" the source, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters.
No comment was immediately available from Total.
Nigerian Navy commander Captain Kolawole Oguntuga said the vessel, which loaded Shell (LON:RDSa) Bonny Light, was hijacked soon after leaving the terminal. The ship did not request a navy escort to provide them with adequate protection, he said.

987,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 07:49AM ET</span>",With memories of Rwanda: The Gambian minister taking on Suu Kyi,"By Aaron Ross
BANJUL (Reuters) - The genocide case brought against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) - the first of its kind initiated since the 1990s - may not have happened at all but for a scheduling conflict.
In May last year, Gambia's foreign minister pulled out at the last minute from the annual conference of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Bangladesh, sending Justice Minister Abubacarr Tambadou instead.
For Tambadou, who spent more than a decade prosecuting cases from Rwanda's 1994 genocide, what he saw and heard in Bangladesh jogged some painful memories.
He joined an OIC delegation visiting overcrowded refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, where some of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who had fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar since August 2017 recounted how, they said, security forces had burnt Rohingya children alive, raped women and killed men.
""I saw genocide written all over these stories,"" Tambadou said in an interview in Gambia's capital, Banjul.
Authorities in Myanmar, including its de facto leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, have denied almost all allegations made by refugees against its troops, who it says were engaged in legitimate counterterrorism operations.
Tambadou introduced a resolution to create an OIC committee to examine alleged abuses against the Rohingya, and this year convinced the 57-member organization to back a formal case against Myanmar - thrusting his tiny West African homeland into the center of one of the most high profile international legal cases in a generation.
When arguments are presented in The Hague next week, Gambia's legal team will face off against a Myanmar delegation led by Suu Kyi.
Tambadou will ask the judges to immediately order Myanmar to cease violence against Rohingya civilians and preserve evidence that could eventually form the basis of a finding that Myanmar committed genocide. Myanmar has vowed to contest the case.
'USE OUR VOICE'
Gambia's role in the case would have been unthinkable until three years ago.
For 22 years, former President Yahya Jammeh's security forces had killed and tortured scores of real or perceived political opponents, according to evidence presented to an ongoing truth commission.
But a 2016 election unexpectedly ended in defeat for Jammeh, who fled into exile. Opposition leader Adama Barrow took power promising to restore human rights and stem corruption.
""Twenty-two years of a brutal dictatorship has taught us how to use our voice,"" said Tambadou, seated behind a desk stacked with legal texts, his shirtsleeves rolled up as he sweated through a power cut.
""We know too well how it feels like to be unable to tell your story to the world, to be unable to share your pain in the hope that someone out there will hear and help.""
The son of a businessman from Banjul, the 46-year-old Tambadou studied law in Britain before returning to Gambia in the late 1990s to practice.
In April 2000, security forces killed 14 student protesters, an event Tambadou credits with pushing him toward human rights work.
Friends tried to steer him away from the kind of work that could have landed him in one of Jammeh's notorious jails or worse, but Tambadou was committed, said Emmanuel Joof, who co-founded a coalition of human rights defenders with him in 2000.
In 2003, he left Gambia to join the United Nations' Tanzania-based International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), where he successfully prosecuted some of the genocide's most notorious figures, including former army chief Augustin Bizimungu, who was sentenced in 2011 to 30 years in prison.
As justice minister since 2017, his decisions have occasionally put him at odds with former colleagues, such as when he ordered members of a Jammeh-era hit squad released from prison on technical grounds.
""Sometimes we don't agree with him,"" said Joof, who is now chairman of the independent National Human Rights Commission. ""But the fact that it's (a) person who is passionate about these issues gives someone like me great comfort.""
LEGAL BATTLE
Tambadou, a devout Muslim with a prominent prayer bump on his forehead, acknowledged that Islamic solidarity was a factor behind Gambia and the OIC's actions but said ""this is about our humanity ultimately"".
Authorities in Myanmar reacted swiftly to Gambia's submissions, which cite U.N. investigators' findings that Myanmar's military acted with ""genocidal intent"".
Suu Kyi's office said she would attend the hearings to ""defend the national interest of Myanmar"" and supporters have rallied behind her in street demonstrations and on social media.
Tambadou said that after several years in which Myanmar had refused to engage with international organizations over its handling of the Rohingya crisis, he was pleased his initiative had elicited such a strong response.
""I am glad that very senior members of the government will be at the court,"" he said. ""It shows the seriousness ... with which they are taking this case."""

MINSK (Reuters) - The veteran leader of Belarus on Thursday dismissed opposition fears that a possible integration pact with Russia could end with his country losing its independence to Moscow, saying the two countries were not discussing deeper political ties.
Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, is due to hold talks on Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin on an integration road map, but a lack of detail on what it might include has fueled fears that Moscow aims to gain new influence in ex-Soviet Belarus as part of a creeping plan to absorb it.
Leaders of the enfeebled opposition in Minsk warned this week that the deal could ""potentially threaten the continued existence of Belarus as an independent state"". 
But Lukashenko said there was no need to worry.
""I don't want to cross out everything I've done with you, the people, and having created a sovereign independent state ... now toss it aside and hand it over,"" Lukashenko told parliamentarians. 
""That will never happen while I'm in charge. It's our country. We are sovereign and independent,"" he added, saying the two neighbors were not discussing a unified parliament or other political questions. 
Russia has helped to prop up Lukashenko over the past 25 years with loans and energy subsidies. But it started to scale back this help last year, prompting Lukashenko to accuse Russia of trying to bully his much smaller country into a union. 
The Belarusian government says it stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year from changes to Russian tax policy and wants compensation. Russia says the subsidies it pays to Belarus cost its exchequer billions of dollars. 
Putin's current term ends in 2024 when the constitution requires him to leave the Kremlin. However, some critics have speculated he could try to bypass the constitutional limit on serving more than two consecutive terms and retain power by becoming head of a unified Russian and Belarusian state.  
The Kremlin denies this and Putin has said there are no plans afoot to unite Russia and Belarus.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that Putin and Lukashenko planned to discuss a road map to develop bilateral relations, as well as investment projects and natural gas.

During the past week, thousands of Indians have protested in several cities following the alleged rape and murder of a 27-year-old vet near the southern city of Hyderabad. 
Protesters and parliamentarians are pressing for courts to fast-track rape cases and demanding tougher penalties.
The woman attacked and burned on Thursday morning was in a critical condition, according to D.S. Negi, a doctor at the Civil Hospital in Lucknow, the capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
She had been on her way to catch a train in Unnao district to attend a hearing when she was doused with kerosene and set on fire, police said.
""As per victim's statement five people were involved in setting her on fire, including the one who was accused in the rape case,"" Vikrant Vir, a police superintendent in Unnao, told Reuters.
All five men have been detained, Uttar Pradesh police said in a tweet.
Police documents seen by Reuters showed the woman had filed a complaint with Unnao police in March alleging that she had been raped at gun-point on December 12, 2018.
Having been subsequently jailed, the alleged rapist was released last week after securing bail, police officer S.K. Bhagat said in Lucknow.
Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state and has become notorious for its poor record regarding crimes against women, with more than 4,200 cases of rape reported there in 2017 - the highest in the country.
The Uttar Pradesh state government, currently controlled by 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), came under fire in July from opposition groups accusing it of protecting a lawmaker accused of rape.

The Brexit Party was set up in early 2019 by Nigel Farage, whose years of relentless campaigning against membership of the European Union played a major part in delivering the 2016 referendum, in which Britons voted to leave the bloc.
It performed strongly in the last European elections, held in May, but has fallen sharply in opinion polls since deciding not to contest seats held by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives, to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.
One of the four MEPs deserting the party is Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of high-profile cabinet minister and arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. Her decision to join the Brexit Party in April had been considered a coup for Farage.
""We need a strong Leave supporting government to deliver the Brexit 17.4m voted for. The Conservatives are the only option for Brexit supporters and democrats alike,"" Annunziata Rees-Mogg said in a statement."

Zimbabweans are keen to know how much wealth Mugabe accrued during his 37 years in power. Many assume that he and his family amassed a vast fortune - perhaps as much as $1 billion, according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable from 2001. 
The Master of High Court in Harare appointed Bona Chikore executor of her father's estate, the Mugabe family lawyer Terrence Hussein told reporters, adding that this had been agreed by family members.
Hussein said Mugabe's wife Grace and Bona attended Thursday's meeting at the court but sons Robert Jr and Bellarmine Chatunga were away. They, however, gave written consent that their sister should be appointed executor.
For many years, Mugabe and Grace were widely reported by Zimbabwean and foreign media to have deposited money and bought properties abroad, including in Asia, where they spent most of their annual family holidays. The family has denied this.
But a legal dispute that spilled into the public in 2014 over a $5 million villa in Hong Kong suggested Mugabe's family had been buying overseas property. The government said it owned the house.
Hussein said journalists and United States and Britain, who were critical of Mugabe, should prove that he had properties abroad so they could be registered with the court.
""This is the good thing about saying falsehoods, those falsehoods will be exposed. Where are the properties?"" Hussein said when asked about reports that Mugabe had properties abroad.

Hussein told Reuters on Tuesday that the process of establishing Mugabe's assets would take some time, casting doubt on a state media report that the former leader left $10 million and some properties in the capital.

(Reuters) - A Tennessee man convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend by setting her on fire in her car almost 30 years ago is scheduled to be executed by electric chair on Thursday.
Lee Hall, 54, is set to die at 7 p.m. (0100 GMT) at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville for the 1991 murder of Traci Crozier.
On Wednesday, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee said he would not intervene in the case, a day after Hall was placed on death watch and moved to a cell next to the execution chamber.
Hall has filed several unsuccessful legal challenges in state and federal court since his conviction for first-degree premeditated murder and aggravated arson in 1992 when he was sentenced to death. Tennessee's supreme court this week denied his latest request to delay his execution as his claim that one of the jurors was biased because she was a victim of domestic violence is considered.
In the spring of 1991, Crozier moved in with her grandmother and uncle in Chattanooga after breaking up with Hall, who she lived with for five years.
Three weeks after the breakup, during the night of April 16, Hall drank a case of beer and went looking for Crozier. On his way to her home, he filled a tea jug with gasoline and bought a cigarette lighter, according to court documents citing his testimony.
Hall found Crozier driving up to her grandmother's home and an argument ensued. He then doused her with the gasoline and lit her ablaze inside her two-door Nissan Pulsar.
A neighbor saw ""a ball of fire"" in the middle of the street and called for emergency assistance as her son helped pull Crozier out of the torched car. The neighbor said that Crozier remained alert, telling her that Hall set the fire and saying ""it was gas, gas bomb. He set me on fire.""
When fire and rescue workers arrived at the scene, they found Crozier with 95% of her body burned and rushed her to the hospital where she succumbed to her injures hours later.
When Hall was questioned by police, he said he only intended to burn Crozier's car, like he did once before, court papers said.
Hall would be the 20th inmate in the United States and the third in Tennessee to be executed in 2019, according to the Death Penalty Information Center."

(Reuters) - A U.S. Navy sailor shot dead two civilians working at Hawaii's historic military base of Pearl Harbor on Wednesday and wounded a third before turning his gun on himself, military officials said.
Authorities did not identify the victims or the gunman, described by a witness as wearing a U.S. Navy uniform, but local media reported they were all men. Base officials said the victims were civilians working for the Department of Defense.
It was not immediately clear what the gunman's motive was for the shooting, three days before the 78th anniversary of the Dec. 7, 1941 attack on the naval base that led the United States to declare war on Japan and enter World War Two.
The gunman died of ""an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound"", and the third victim was in stable condition in hospital, military officials told a news briefing.
""We have confirmed that two (victims) are deceased,"" said the regional commander, Rear Admiral Robert Chadwick.
The gunman ""has tentatively been identified as an active-duty sailor assigned to USS Columbia SSN 771,"" he said.
The base, a combined U.S. Air Force and Navy installation located eight miles (13 km) from the state capital of Honolulu, was placed on lockdown for about two hours after the incident at about 2:30 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time.
""We have no indication yet whether they (the victims) were targeted or if it was a random shooting,"" Chadwick said.
He said he also did not know the type of weapon used by the attacker and that bringing personal weapons on the base was not authorized.
Emergency services sent ambulances and firefighters to the scene, which was secured by late Wednesday and the base reopened.
An unidentified witness told Hawaii News Now he had heard gunfire near Drydock 2 of the base and looked up from his desk to see the gunman, wearing an U.S. Navy uniform, put the weapon to his head and shoot himself.
""Details are still emerging as security forces at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam investigate,"" Hawaii Governor David Ige said, using the official name of the base.
The White House had offered him assistance from federal agencies as needed, Ige said.
A White House spokesman said: ""The president has been briefed on the shooting...and continues to monitor the situation.""
Hawaii police detectives are assisting the military in an investigation that could require up to 100 witnesses to be interviewed, local media said."

SEOUL (Reuters) - A senior China diplomat offered conciliatory remarks to South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday amid efforts to repair ties strained by a U.S. anti-missile system, while leveling sharp criticism at the United States for ""Cold War"" thinking.
State Councillor Wang Yi, who is also China's foreign minister, met with Moon on the final day of a two-day visit to Seoul, his first in four years. Relations between the two countries have been strained by South Korea's installation of a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in 2017.
""We agree to deal with THAAD and other issues properly so we can earnestly respect each other's core interests,"" Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said during a briefing in Beijing.
But Wang sharply criticized the United States over THAAD in remarks to a lunchtime gathering of South Korean business people and former government officials in Seoul.
""The U.S. made it to target China,"" Wang said, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. A ""Cold War way of thinking"" is out of date and ""hegemony cannot win people's hearts"", he said.
""China's revival is inevitable in history and no one can stop it,"" he said at the lunch, which was organized by the Chinese embassy in Seoul. 
Moon, meanwhile, asked Wang for Beijing's help to ""reach a nuclear-free, peaceful peninsula"" as tensions with North Korea rise.
""A close dialogue and cooperation between the two countries will help to stabilize Northeast Asia's security and overcome the uncertainty the global economy is facing,"" Moon said.
South Korea sees China as instrumental in reviving the stalemated nuclear talks between the United States and North Korea, a longtime ally of Beijing.
Denuclearization negotiations between North Korea and the United States reached stalemate after a working-level meeting in Stockholm broke down in October.
On Wednesday, Wang met South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and agreed to hold the first gathering of a planned joint vice-ministerial panel on people-to-people exchanges ""in the near future"" and create a new meeting on maritime affairs, South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement. 

Kang and Wang also agreed to cooperate to facilitate negotiations with North Korea based on the shared view that its nuclear programs cannot be accepted, peace should be maintained and there must not be war again, a South Korean foreign ministry official told reporters.

Bulgaria's ambassador in Moscow, Atanas Krastin, has been informed that the diplomat must leave Russia within the next 24 hours in line with diplomatic protocol, the ministry said in a statement. Moscow cited the ""principle of reciprocity"", it said.
Sofia said in October it had requested the diplomat's recall after Bulgarian prosecutors said he had been involved in espionage. It also declined to grant a visa to Russia's incoming defense attache.
Bulgaria, a loyal ally of Moscow in communist times, is now a member of NATO and the European Union but retains close cultural and historic ties to Russia, which remains its biggest energy supplier.

997,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 05:07AM ET</span>","Brazil, Trump head to-do list for Argentina's incoming foreign minister","By Nicolás Misculin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's incoming foreign minister will face a sizeable to-do list: navigating shifting political sands in Latin America, cementing ties with U.S. President Donald Trump, and easing a testy relationship between his new boss and top trade partner Brazil.
Felipe Sola, a 69-year-old Peronist with a background in farming, is expected to be confirmed on Friday as Argentina's top diplomat in the cabinet of President-elect Alberto Fernandez, a party spokesman told Reuters.
Sola's spokesman declined to comment.
Seen as a pragmatic consensus builder within the diverse Peronist political faction at home, Sola now faces an international challenge: mending bridges between center-left Fernandez and Brazil's far-right Jair Bolsonaro.
The leaders of Latin American's first and third largest economies have been openly hostile to one another, a potential threat to trade ties worth $27 billion last year.
Bolsonaro recently called Fernandez and his supporters ""left-wing bandits,"" while the Argentine leader shot back that the Brazilian was a ""misogynist"" and ""racist.""
""Only time and pragmatism will prevent major damage,"" said political scientist Andrés Malamud, adding that Argentina needed to diversify its trade partners to get out from Brazil's shadow.
Sola, who has appeared frequently beside Fernandez in recent diplomatic meetings, is seen as having the flexibility needed. He has held various posts within Peronist governments since the late 1980s, many linked to the farming sector - the main engine of Argentina's economy and exports.
As the international face of the new administration, Sola will also need to keep the United States onside amid complex debt negotiations with creditors including the International Monetary Fund over around $100 billion in sovereign debt.
""We are going to look for the best possible relationship with the United States,"" Sola said in a recent interview with local radio station La Red, adding he would not allow ""ideology"" to jeopardize any international ties.
That may not be easy. Trump earlier this week said he would reimpose tariffs on Argentine and Brazilian steel and aluminum, citing their weak currencies.
""In a protectionist world, Argentina loses, because it has commodities to sell,"" said political analyst Sergio Berensztein.
Regionally, Fernandez's government will represent a shift to the left for Argentina, and the incoming administration has already aligned itself with left-leaning Latin American allies such as Mexico.
Sola is also known for occasional outbursts, which could test diplomatic ties. Last year, he slammed the then energy secretary after a sharp rise in prices.
""I would kick the official who signed this in the ass so hard that he would die of hunger while in the air,"" he said."

999,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 04:47AM ET</span>",Israel's foreign minister says he hopes Corbyn loses British election,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's foreign minister said on Thursday that he hopes Jeremy Corbyn loses next week's British election, citing allegations of anti-Semitism buffeting the Labour Party leader.
With Israel in political disarray of its own after two inconclusive elections, the British contest has elicited few comments from Israeli leaders despite deep concern among British Jews over Corbyn and media reports that some might opt to emigrate if he wins.
Last week, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the Israeli government had not discussed the prospect of Corbyn's election or the future of intelligence and security ties with Britain should the veteran pro-Palestinian campaigner become its leader.
But pressed on the issue in an Israeli Army Radio interview on Thursday, Katz was more forthcoming as the Dec. 12 ballot approaches.
""I won't meddle in internal elections but I personally hope that he won't be elected, with this whole wave of anti-Semitism...I hope the other side wins,"" he said.
Labour Party spokesmen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Katz played down the prospect that security relations with Britain, which include intelligence sharing over Islamist militant activity, would necessarily be degraded should Corbyn take office.
""Leaders don't harm their country's own interests so fast. But we will of course discuss these things if they occur,"" Katz said.
Corbyn has rejected allegations of anti-Semitism - last week Britain's chief rabbi accused him of failing to stem the ""poison"" gripping Labour - while holding to policies that rile Israel.
Last year, Corbyn said he would recognize a Palestinian state if elected. In a speech on Sunday, he pledged increased oversight of British arms exports to Israel in the name of not fuelling its conflict with the Palestinians.
On Tuesday, Corbyn made a direct apology for not doing enough to tackle anti-Semitism in his party.
""Obviously I'm very sorry for everything that has happened,"" he said. ""But I want to make this clear, I am dealing with it, I have dealt with it.""
Polls have shown Labour trailing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party. And for now, Israel does not appear to be bracing for any influx of British Jewish immigrants.
Asked about this possibility, its Immigration Ministry said in a brief statement only that it ""is prepared to take in immigrants from all over the world and welcomes immigration in any political situation"".
The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency for Israel, which handles immigration requests abroad, said 507 British Jews moved to Israel between January and October, an 8% rise compared with the same period in 2018.
Yigal Palmor, the agency's head of international relations, played down any sense that Corbyn's candidacy was a major spur for British Jews to leave.

""We have no solid findings to show an increase in British immigration (due to the elections). What we have are more general indications - more discussions of the option,"" he said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's prime-minister-in-waiting, denied on Thursday that he had sexually assaulted a former male aide, describing the accusation as ""politics at its worst"" days before his ruling party's annual congress.
On Wednesday, a statement issued by Anwar's former aide, Muhammed Yusoff Rawther, accused the former deputy premier of attempting to force him to have sex in September last year.
Reuters could not immediately reach Muhammed Yusoff, but he read out the allegations in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live broadcast on Wednesday. His statement was made to a law officer, according to a copy seen by Reuters.
Anwar has spent nearly a decade in jail on two separate counts of sodomy and for corruption, charges that he and his supporters maintain were aimed at ending his political career.
""I heard about this a month ago. It's not new, attempts to try and influence and bribe or whatever, but this is politics at its worst,"" Anwar said on Thursday.
""Our congress is in two days, so you should anticipate all these sorts of things.""
The latest allegations come at a time when Anwar looks to end a feud with Azmin Ali, his deputy in the People's Justice Party (PKR) and a potential challenger for the premiership promised to Anwar by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
Azmin also has been the subject of a gay sex scandal, linked to a series of videos circulated among politicians and journalists in June, allegedly showing him and another man having sex. Azmin has denied that he is one of the men in the videos.
Homosexuality is illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia, and carries penalties of up to 20 years in jail and whipping if convicted.
Anwar and Azmin on Wednesday shared a photo on their social media pages of them seated next to each other and discussing what they described as measures to promote party unity.
In a statement issued on Thursday, Anwar said the allegations by Muhammed Yusoff were baseless and aimed at scuttling his planned takeover of the premiership.
Anwar was freed of his second sodomy conviction following a royal pardon in May 2018, after Mahathir - who was prime minister when Anwar was jailed the first time for sodomy in 2000 - led the opposition to an unprecedented election victory earlier that month."

By John Irish and Matthias Williams (NYSE:WMB)
PARIS/KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian and Russian leaders will try to seal a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and agree on prisoner swaps when they meet next week, but with Kiev politically constrained and Moscow unlikely to bend, the prospects for peace remain bleak, diplomats said.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin hold their first face-to-face talks on Dec. 9 in Paris with the French and German leaders more than three years since the countries' heads of state last met. It comes after a slight easing of tensions. 
Over 13,000 people have been killed in the more than five-year-old conflict in east Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces. There has been little sign of a peaceful solution despite a ceasefire agreement signed in February 2015 in Minsk.
Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April promising to end the simmering conflict, but facing pressure from his opposition, he is wary of conceding too much to Moscow.
""If we start discussing the real political, military and security issues, namely, withdrawal of some troops on the line of contact, the question of local elections and the status of Donbass region, you see that the two leaders don't have a lot of room for manoeuvre,"" said a senior French diplomat.
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, which prompted Western sanctions.
Key to the accords are elections in Donbass, but both sides accuse each other of failing to stick to the deal, which also includes restoring Kiev’s control over the whole border with Russia and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the conflict zone.
""Our main expectation for #NormandySummit and any other formats is what I call #RUxit - we want Russiа and Russian forces to leave Ukraine,"" Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said on Twitter on Tuesday. 
Vladimir Frolov, a former senior Russian diplomat, said he saw little chance of a major breakthrough in Paris describing the positions as irreconcilable. 
""Zelenskiy is going to hit two walls, one in Paris and one afterwards - the wall of Russian intransigence and the wall of Ukrainian public unwillingness to endorse humiliating compromises with Russia,"" Frolov said.
""Moscow does not care about sanctions relief, it cares about meeting its strategic objectives in Ukraine ... and a confederate Ukrainian state that Kiev does not fully control,"" he said.
Calling it a test barometer to see where both sides stood,
another French diplomat said progress on a ceasefire and 
prisoner swaps would be a good basis to move forward. 
The summit also comes within the wider context of Europe's relations with Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron has sought a reset with Moscow, something that has unnerved eastern European Union partners. 
""It can't just be about Ukraine. It has to be about the Russia-West-U.S. conflict otherwise the Russians don't have the incentives to resolve things because Ukraine is too valuable a chip,"" said a former senior U.S. official.

The two countries are at loggerheads over offshore maritime zones around the island, where Cyprus has granted licenses to multinational companies for oil and gas research.
Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said Cyprus is committed to protecting its sovereign rights with every legal means possible.
""Our recourse to The Hague has that very purpose,"" he told journalists in Nicosia.
Turkey, which does not have diplomatic relations with Cyprus's internationally recognized government, says Nicosia either has no jurisdiction to offer licenses or that some zones encroach on the Turkish continental shelf. It has sent its own drill ships to the island.
Anastasiades said Cyprus had attempted to deliver a notice of its intentions to Turkey's embassy in Athens but it was not accepted. ""So it was sent another way,"" he said. ""There is proof that it was received, so that gives (Cyprus) the right to recourse.""
Cyprus's Sigma TV, which first reported the story, said the notice was sent by fax.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's proposed new privacy bill may require large social media platforms to offer an identify-verification option, a potentially precedent-setting effort to rein in the spread of ""fake news"", two government sources told Reuters on Thursday.
The requirement would likely raise a host of technical and policy issues for companies including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and its WhatsApp and Instagram units, Twitter and Chinese app TikTok, all of which have millions of users in India.
Companies would have to offer a mechanism for users to prove their identities and display that verification publicly, akin to the blue check-mark that Twitter has used to confirm the authenticity of some high-profile accounts, including those belonging to celebrities and politicians.
Verification would be optional for users, the sources said.
The Personal Data Protection bill, whose first draft was made public last year, is keenly awaited by top technology companies and industry stakeholders as it could alter the way all major internet companies process, store and transfer Indian consumers' data.
The identity verification requirement, introduced in the latest draft of the bill, would be one of the most ambitious efforts globally to battle disinformation and fake news, which is often spread by pseudonymous or fake accounts.
""The idea was to reduce the spread of fake news and online trolling,"" said one of the sources, a federal IT ministry official.
The privacy bill was cleared by cabinet on Wednesday and will be presented to parliament soon, officials said. But passage is not imminent, one of the sources said, as the legislation will likely be referred to a parliamentary expert committee or a panel for further review.
Since 2017, fake news and rumour-mongering on social media in India has led to more than 30 deaths, data portal IndiaSpend said last year.
The companies have taken some measures to combat the problem -- including a move by WhatsApp to limit group-forwarding of messages.
But Facebook and other companies have resisted the idea that they should verify the identify of their users, partly on the grounds that people in many countries would struggle to provide sufficient documentation.
The voluntary verification scheme would give users more confidence in the validity of information on the verified accounts, though it would not eliminate fake accounts."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - China has too many other issues to worry about at the moment, from protests in Hong Kong to a slowing economy, to give much thought to Taiwan, the mayor of Taipei, sometimes seen as a potential future president, said on Thursday.
China claims self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as its own territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary. It regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive issue in China-U.S. ties, Washington being Taiwan's main arms supplier.
But Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, who has advocated for better relations with China, told Reuters that while Taiwan was important to China, it was not currently the ""core issue"" that Beijing likes to portray.
""They say that Taiwan is a core issue, but I'm very clear that it isn't. Taiwan is not China's core issue,"" he said.
""In comparison to Hong Kong, to Xinjiang, Taiwan is not on the top of the priority list. For mainland China, there are their economic problems, their GDP has already fallen to below 7%,"" Ko added in an interview, where he switched between Mandarin and English.
Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has been rocked by anti-government protests for nearly six months, the biggest challenge to President Xi Jinping since he took charge in 2012. China has come under international opprobrium for locking up a million or more Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang as part of what it calls a de-radicalisation program.
In any case, Ko said, the United States - Taiwan's most important international backer even in the absence of diplomatic ties - would not let Taiwan become formally independent or be taken over by China.
While the 60-year-old Ko decided not to run for the presidency for elections scheduled for Jan. 11, the position he holds is traditionally a stepping stone to the presidency. The three presidents preceding current leader President Tsai Ing-wen all served as Taipei mayor.
If Tsai wins re-election - and polling is on her side - she cannot then stand for a third term in 2024.
Ko, who this year formed a new political party, the Taiwan People's Party, said it was still too early for him to say if he would run in 2024, adding he would decide when his mayoral term runs out in three years time.
""Do what you should do now and let God decide,"" he said.
A surgeon turned politician, Ko is known for his colorful personal style. Last year he made a rap video for his mayoral re-election campaign called ""Do the right thing"", which quickly went viral.
Ko has sought his own path between Taiwan's two main parties, Tsai's pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party and the Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China.
Visiting the United States earlier this year, Ko told the conservative Heritage Foundation that Taiwan can be close to the United States but also friendly with China.
In July, Ko also went to Shanghai to meet the city's mayor, Ying Yong. While there, he reiterated previous comments that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait ""are one family"". 
Ko said he had no plans so far to go to China next year.
Senior Chinese leaders are always on their guard in such meetings, as if you make a mistake in China ""you will be disappeared from the world"", he added, with a laugh. 

""They were very, very nervous when they talked with me. Because I'm very unpredictable. We're very easy. We say what we think. They can't. They're very rigid.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tetsu Nakamura, the Japanese doctor and aid worker killed in Afghanistan on Wednesday, was inspired to make the country's deserts green by the deaths of children in a clinic he ran in a drought-stricken rural area.
""You'd hear a child screaming in the waiting room, but by the time you got there they'd be dead,"" he told NHK television in an October program.
""That happened almost every day. They were so malnourished that things like diarrhea could kill them ... My thinking was that if those patients had had clean water and enough to eat, they would have survived.""
His death in a Wednesday attack by unknown gunmen who riddled the car he and five others were driving with bullets left both Afghanistan and Japan in mourning.
Born in western Japan, Nakamura, 73, trained as a doctor and answered a 1984 recruitment call to work in a clinic treating leprosy in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, attracted by the region's stark beauty.
He began treating Afghan refugees who were pouring over the border in the wake of the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which led to him opening a clinic in that country in 1991.
""I couldn't ignore the Afghans,"" he said.
Following a devastating 2000 drought which brought scores of starving and ill people to his clinic, he first helped bore wells and then came up with the idea of an irrigation canal, inspired by similarities between Japanese and Afghan rivers.
In 2003 - the same year Nakamura was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award, often called Asia's Nobel - construction began. After six grueling years of labor, much of it by hand and in temperatures as high as 50 Celsius, the canal was finally completed.
Since then, some 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of desert has been brought back to life, making Nakamura such a widely revered figure in Afghanistan that earlier this year he became the first foreigner awarded Afghan citizenship.
""As a doctor, nothing is better than healing patients and sending them home,"" and re-greening the desert did the same for rural Afghanistan, Nakamura told NHK
""A hospital treats patients one by one, but this helps an entire village...I love seeing a village that's been brought back to life."""
1007,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 12:13AM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. military completes pullback from northeast Syria, Esper says","By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has completed its military pullback in northeastern Syria, settling into a more stable posture of about 600 troops in the rest of the country after repositioning and reducing forces, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said.
Esper's remarks in an interview with Reuters could signal the end of a period of turbulence and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. military presence in Syria after President Donald Trump's initial withdrawal order in October.
Since then, troop levels in Syria have fallen about 40 percent from around 1,000.
Esper stressed he retained the ability to move in and out smaller numbers of forces as needed into Syria. But he suggested the number of troops will fluctuate around the 600-level for the foreseeable future.
""It will be relatively static around that number. But if we see things happen ... I can dial up a little bit,"" Esper said late on Wednesday during a flight back from the NATO summit on the outskirts of London.
Esper also didn't rule out being able to reduce U.S. troop levels in Syria further if European allies contributed to the Syria mission.
""The coalition is talking a lot again. We could see some allies want to volunteer troops,"" Esper said, without suggesting any new contribution was imminent.
""If an allied country, a NATO country, decided to give us 50 people, I might be able to turn off 50 people.""
The U.S. military says it is focused on preventing a resurgence of Islamic State in Syria and carried out a raid last month that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Trump, in London, said he wanted remaining U.S. forces to ensure Syria's oil reserves don't fall back into the militant group's hands.
""We kept the oil. And the oil is what fueled ISIS,"" Trump said, using an acronym for Islamic State.
NO MOVEMENT ON TURKEY S-400S
Trump softened his pullout plans for Syria after backlash from Congress, including among key Republicans, who say he cleared the way for a long-threatened Turkish incursion against Kurdish forces in Syria who had been America's top allies in the battle against Islamic State.
NATO diplomats worry that Turkey, a NATO member since 1952 and a critical ally in the Middle East, has increasingly acted unilaterally, launching its incursion in Syria against U.S.-backed forces and buying advanced Russian S-400 air defenses.
Washington says the S-400 system is incompatible with NATO air defenses, poses a threat to  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Corp's F-35 stealth fighter jets and announced in July it was removing Turkey from the F-35 program. It has also warned of possible U.S. sanctions.
After summit talks between Trump and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Esper suggested Ankara had not budged yet on the S-400 issue.
""There's no movement at this point,"" Esper said.
Still, after lobbying by NATO allies, including the United States, Erdogan backed off from a threat to block defense plans for the Baltic states and Poland unless allies declared Kurdish fighters in Syria terrorists.
""I think it was a positive move forward,"" Esper said, of the change in position by Turkey.
""They've been a valuable part of NATO for decades, from the earliest days. So we got to keep them in the fold."""

Ambassador Cui Tiankai, speaking at a dinner hosted by the US-China Business Council, said U.S.-Chinese ties were at a critical crossroads due to trade frictions, but it was possible to return to a better path.
""At the same time, we must be alert that some destructive forces are taking advantage of the ongoing trade friction (through) extreme rhetoric such as 'decoupling,' the 'new Cold War,' and ‘clash of civilizations,'"" Cui said.
He urged U.S. and Chinese companies keen to expand trade between the two countries to stand up against what he called efforts to ""spread hostility and even create conflict between us,"" as well as ""fake news"" about the situations in both Hong Kong and Xinjiang, China's troubled western region that is home to a large Uighur Muslim minority, whom some U.S. officials have said are the victims of human rights abuses.
Cui's comments came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said a long-awaited interim trade agreement with China could be delayed until after the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, and amid U.S. legislative moves to address the Uighur issue.
The United States and China have been locked in a bitter trade war for 17 months, with the U.S. government cracking down against a broad range of what it sees as efforts by the Chinese government to steal U.S. technology and dominate global markets.
Anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong and Beijing's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority have also fanned longstanding human rights concerns. Beijing views U.S. actions on both issues as interference in its sovereign concerns.
The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday for a bill that would require the Trump administration to toughen its response to China's crackdown on the Uighurs. China warned earlier on Wednesday that the U.S. legislation will affect bilateral cooperation, clouding prospects for a near-term deal to end a trade war.
Cui did not echo those remarks directly, but said reports about both the situation in Hong Kong and Xinjiang had been seriously distorted. ""Facts are facts no matter how much fake news is generated,"" he said.
He did not address the U.S.-Chinese trade talks specifically, but said Beijing remained committed to expanding bilateral trade and investment between the two countries."

A nearly 100 page report by the Organization of American States (OAS) described several violations, including the use of a hidden computer server designed to tilt the vote toward Morales.
A charismatic leftist and Bolivia's first indigenous president, Morales stood for president despite a 2016 referendum that voted down a proposal to allow him to run for a fourth consecutive term. A court packed with loyalists gave him a green light to run indefinitely.
""Given the overwhelming evidence we have found, we can confirm a series of malicious operations aimed at altering the will of the voters,"" the OAS report said.
OAS findings included ""deliberate actions to manipulate the result of the election"" that make it ""impossible to validate"" the official results, the report said.
Morales fled to Mexico shortly after the OAS' initial report in early November. He described the allegations of vote rigging as a political hit, saying the OAS was ""in the service of the North American empire.""
Bolivia’s Congress in late November passed legislation to annul the contested elections and pave the way for a new vote without Morales, a major breakthrough in the political crisis.
Interim President Jeanine Anez, a former conservative lawmaker, has also pledged new elections.
At least 30 people have died in clashes between protesters and security forces since the Oct. 20 election. Most have died since Morales stepped down on Nov. 10."
1010,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 08:49PM ET</span>","China official media blasts U.S. Uighur bill, calls for reprisals","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese official media excoriated the United States and called for harsh reprisals in editorials on Thursday after the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation requiring a stronger response to Beijing's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority.
The commentaries follow warnings from China on Wednesday that the legislation could affect bilateral cooperation, including a near-term deal to end the two countries' trade war.
A front-page editorial in the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper said the passage of the U.S. legislation ""harbors evil intent and is extremely sinister"".
""Underestimating the determination and will of the Chinese people is doomed to fail,"" it said.
By a vote of 407 to 1, the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved the Uighur bill, which would require the Trump administration to toughen its response to China's crackdown in Xinjiang, a region in China's far west.
The bill still has to be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate before being sent to U.S. President Donald Trump to sign into law.
The White House has yet to say whether Trump would sign or veto the bill, which contains a provision allowing the president to waive sanctions if he determines that to be in the national interest.
U.N. experts and activists say China has detained possibly one million Uighurs in mass detention camps in Xinjiang.
China says the camps are part of an anti-terror crackdown and are providing vocational training. It denies any mistreatment of Uighurs.
The English-language China Daily called the bill a ""stab in the back, given Beijing's efforts to stabilize the already turbulent China-U.S. relationship"".
""It seems an odds-on bet that more (sanctions) can be expected if the latest approval for State Department meddling goes into the statute books,"" it said.
The English-language edition of the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid published by the People's Daily, said China should be prepared for a ""long-term battle with the U.S.""
The editorials echoed comments by Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, who said on Wednesday that ""any wrong words and deeds must pay the due price.""
Official commentary also took aim at the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, recently signed into law by Trump.
The act requires the U.S. State Department to certify at least annually that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to justify favourable U.S. trading terms, and threatens sanctions for human rights violations
A front-page editorial in the overseas edition of the People's Daily framed the bill as a U.S. attempt to use Hong Kong to contain China, calling such a move ""idiotic nonsense"".
""The Chinese government will in no way allow anyone to act wilfully in Hong Kong, and must take effective measures to prevent, contain and counteract external forces from interfering in Hong Kong affairs.""
Hong Kong has been wracked by nearly six months of often violent protests, with demonstrators demanding greater democratic freedoms in the Chinese city."

Japan maintains friendly ties with both the United States and Iran, and has said it would not join any U.S. coalition to protect merchant vessels in the region.
The Nikkei said the government would propose deploying one escort ship and a patrol aircraft from the Maritime Self-Defense Force on a one-year mission that could be renewed annually. It plans to finalize the plan by year-end, the Nikkei said.
Global commodity trading has been rocked this year by attacks on international merchant vessels that Japan's Western allies have blamed on Iran. Tehran denies involvement.
Tensions have heightened between Tehran and Washington since last year, when President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six nations and re-imposed sanctions on the country, crippling its economy.
Japan, which has stopped buying oil from Iran because of U.S. sanctions, is eager to see stability in the Middle East, where it gets the bulk of its oil imports.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has tried unsuccessfully to ease tensions between the two countries. Iran has criticized U.S. efforts to build an alliance to protect shipping in the Gulf, and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Japanese public broadcaster NHK this week after meeting with Abe that Tehran was opposed to any foreign forces in the region.
Iran has also proposed a visit to Japan by President Hassan Rouhani try to resolve Iran's nuclear impasse with Washington, Kyodo news reported.
Japan's pacifist constitution bans a standing military but allows self-defense forces. The prospect of deploying navy personnel to the region has sparked calls for caution from liberal media and other critics."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Samoa closed all non-essential public and private services on Thursday to combat a measles epidemic that has killed more than 60 people, mostly babies and young children, in a medical task complicated by a vocal anti-vaccination movement.
The measles virus has so far infected more than 4,200 people in the South Pacific nation of only 200,000, government data shows, prompting medical teams to go door-to-door this week to vaccinate families still susceptible to the highly contagious disease.
The government-imposed shut-down, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, is designed to free up resources for the vaccine drive and ensure people, some of whom are fearful of the vaccine, are at home when medical teams visit.
""Families are getting conflicting messages and it's hard for them to then know what is the best thing for their child,"" said Cate Heinrich, a Pacific spokeswoman at U.N. agency UNICEF.
""It's been a problem in Samoa but also globally with the anti-vaxxers giving out their message,"" she said, referring to groups advocating against the use of vaccines.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunization for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism or other medical conditions.
The virus got a foothold in Samoa last month after devastating communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine, among others.
SOCIAL MEDIA
The devastating appearance of measles in Samoa has triggered conflicting advice on social media, especially on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is a hugely popular platform in the Pacific.
Networks originating overseas including in North America have linked up with Samoans to send vitamins to the Pacific, according to social media posts, accompanied by claims that many of the measles cases may be caused by the vaccine.
Dr Richard Kidd, chair of the Australian Medical Association council of general practice, said such assertions were absurd - and dangerous.
""There are some people who can never be vaccinated because they might have allergies or they have serious immune problems and that's why the rest of us need to share the responsibility to protect those who can't,"" Kidd said.
Vaccine rates in Samoa were only about 31% when measles took hold, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which was far less than Pacific neighbors like Fiji and Tonga where the disease has been more contained.
Kidd said countries required a target coverage rate of 95% to reach ""herd immunity"", a term to describe a population's ability to stop a disease from spreading.
In just over two weeks, the official death toll has jumped more than ten-fold to 62 on Thursday, the Samoan government said.
Samoan authorities have blamed low coverage rates in Samoa in part on fears caused last year when two babies died after receiving vaccinations shots, which led to the temporary suspension of the country's immunization program.
The tragedy prompted anti-vaccination groups to warn against immunizations in Samoa, although the deaths were later found to have been caused by medications that were wrongly prepared."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Wednesday said it was working with Mexico's government to identify the ""appropriate tools"" to help it tackle the threats that drug cartels pose, after President Donald Trump last week said he wanted to designate them as terrorist groups.
Trump's announcement alarmed Mexico, which rejected it as ""interventionism"" and said it would respond in kind to such a move. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said, for instance, that Mexico would not permit another operation like the U.S. government's ill-fated ""Fast and Furious"" gun-running sting.
Designating groups as foreign terrorist organizations is aimed at disrupting their finances through the imposition of U.S. sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, on them and individuals and entities that support them.
Speaking at a briefing with reporters, Hugo Rodriguez, deputy assistant secretary of state for Central America, did not offer specifics on the next steps but said the U.S. agencies have been looking at this issue for months.
""What we are looking to do is put at the service of the government of Mexico any and all tools we have at our disposal to cooperate on the shared security challenge that the drug trafficking organizations pose,"" he said.
""We have to work with them (Mexico) to find the tools that are going to be appropriate in the context,"" he said. ""If we have tools at our disposal that we can use that help contribute to addressing the DTO challenge, we're looking at it.""
While this would not directly give the United States authority for military operations in Mexico, many Mexicans are nervous their northern neighbor could use it as a pretext for a unilateral intervention.
Lopez Obrador, who has attempted to chart a less confrontational security policy during his first year in office, reiterated he would not permit an armed foreign intervention a century after the country was last invaded, arguing that his government was already doing its part to battle criminal gangs.
Trump has repeatedly offered military assistance in the fight against drug gangs, which Lopez Obrador has always declined, even after the gangland massacre of a U.S.-Mexican family earlier this month.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr will visit Mexico on Thursday to discuss cooperation on security, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard announced on Wednesday.
Barr will meet with Lopez Obrador, as well as Mexico's own attorney general, plus the security and foreign ministers, according to the announcement.
The Mexican president has previously said his government will seek to strengthen cooperation with the United States to control the flow of ""arms and dollars.""
The U.S. State Department includes dozens of organizations on its list of terrorist groups. In Latin America, left-wing guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries, both involved in drug trafficking, have in the past appeared on the list.

In a statement, the Pentagon confirmed that on Nov. 25 a U.S. warship found ""advanced missile components"" on a stateless vessel and an initial investigation indicated the parts were of Iranian origin.
""A more thorough investigation is underway,"" the statement said.
U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the guided missile destroyer Forrest Sherman detained a small boat and a detachment of U.S. personnel boarded the vessel, where the missile parts were found.
The crew on the small boat have been transferred to the Yemeni Coast Guard and the missile parts are in the possession of the United States, the officials added.
One of the officials said they believed from initial information that the weapons were bound for Iran-aligned Houthi fighters in Yemen. 
In recent years, U.S. warships have intercepted and seized Iranian arms likely bound for Houthi fighters. The official said this was different, citing the advanced nature of the parts. 
Under a United Nations resolution, Tehran is prohibited from supplying, selling or transferring weapons outside the country unless approved by the Security Council. A separate U.N. resolution on Yemen bans the supply of weapons to Houthi leaders.
The Houthis have built their arsenal using local manufacturing, foreign expertise and parts smuggled in from Iran, their ally, and elsewhere. The conflict in Yemen is seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
A senior Pentagon official said earlier on Wednesday there were indications that Iran could potentially carry out aggressive actions in the future.
Tensions in the Gulf have risen since attacks on oil tankers this summer, including off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, and a major assault on energy facilities in Saudi Arabia. Washington has blamed Iran, which has denied being behind the attacks.
Since May, the Pentagon has sent 14,000 additional troops to the region to deter Iran. 
U.S. officials told Reuters there were ongoing conversations about potentially adding additional U.S. troops in the Middle East, but that no decisions have been made and plans were fluid.

Britons will vote on Dec. 12 after parliament agreed to an early election, seeking to end more than three years of deep disagreement over the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union that has sapped investors' faith in the stability of the world's fifth largest economy.
Johnson, 55, has pledged to push through his divorce deal by Jan. 31 if he wins the election. The European Union granted Britain a third delay to Brexit, which was originally supposed to have taken place at the end of March.
When asked if the public will stop talking about Brexit after the end of January, Johnson told  ITV  (LON:ITV): ""Yes, and now let me say something.
""What will happen is that the parliamentary agony will be over, and the political agony will be over, and the misery and tedium and procrastination that's been going on will be over.""
The first December election in Britain since 1923 will be one of the hardest to forecast in years. Brexit has scrambled voters' traditional loyalties and is giving smaller rivals a chance to challenge the two biggest parties.
Opinion polls show Johnson's Conservative Party commands a sizeable lead over the Labour Party, although large numbers of undecided voters means the outcome is not certain.
Johnson denies that his party's candidates have been coerced into backing Brexit after they all agreed to support his deal in parliament if he wins a majority. 
""I have not forced them, that's totally unfair, there was absolutely no lobotomy,"" he said.
Johnson said there will be a surge of foreign investment if Brexit is resolved, citing research by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) this week that 150 billion pounds ($192 billion) would be unlocked.
""That is a lot of money. The question for the people of this country is what sort of Christmas present do they want?""
""There is a tidal wave of investment waiting to come into this country once we can get Brexit done,"" Johnson said.
Johnson's statement contrasted with the government's own analysis last year that said Britain would be economically poorer under every form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU.

MIAMI (Reuters) - Former Florida volunteer community watchman George Zimmerman, whose 2012 killing of unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin drew attention across the United States, sued Martin's family and lawyers on Wednesday, saying they used a fake witness against him.
Zimmerman is seeking at least $100 million in damages from Martin's parents, state prosecutors and two women, who are accused in a Polk County, Florida, lawsuit of helping provide false statements to investigators and during the trial, according to court papers.
On Feb. 26, 2012, Zimmerman, who was then a neighborhood watch captain in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, fatally shot Martin after the teen's trip to a convenience store to buy snacks. The incident helped spark the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Zimmerman was arrested and charged. During the 2013 trial, prosecutors argued Zimmerman profiled, pursued and confronted the black youth. Zimmerman claimed he shot Martin in self defense and was found not guilty by a jury.
The lawsuit accuses Martin's parents and the family's attorney Benjamin Crump of orchestrating a campaign to force Brittany Diamond Eugene, 16, who was reportedly Martin's girlfriend, to make a recorded statement that implicated Zimmerman as the aggressor in the altercation with Martin.
Eugene was on the phone with Martin moments before the altercation with Zimmerman, the suit said.
The lawsuit also says that Eugene's half-sister Rachel Jeantel pretended to be Eugene when she was interviewed by prosecutors and provided false statements to incriminate Zimmerman based on coaching from others in court during his trial.
Crump said in a statement on behalf of himself and Martin's parents that he has confidence that the ""unfounded and reckless"" lawsuit will be revealed as ""another failed attempt to defend the indefensible and a shameless attempt to profit off the lives and grief of others.""
Martin's uncle, Ronald Fulton, 56, said the lawsuit was no more than a publicity stunt to promote a forthcoming documentary titled the ""Trayvon Hoax"" that alleges Jeantel was an impostor. 
""During the trial, most of the people they brought in were officers of Orange County, were they a hoax too?"" he asked a Reuters reporter during a telephone interview."

DENVER (Reuters) - A 16-year-old transgender teenager should be tried as an adult on murder charges stemming from a shooting rampage at a suburban Denver high school in which one student was killed and eight others wounded, a Colorado judge ruled on Wednesday.
Alec McKinney, 16, was ordered along with Devon Erickson, 19, to stand trial on first-degree murder, attempted murder and weapons charges in the May 7 shooting at the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) School in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, on May 7.
An 18-year-old student at the school, Kendrick Castillo, was shot to death when he ran toward one of the two assailants in what has been called a heroic effort to stop the shooting and save lives.
Prosecutors charged McKinney, who was born female but identifies as male, as an adult in the case.
McKinney's lawyers sought to have the case moved to juvenile court, citing their client's mental health issues and troubled childhood, including witnessing domestic violence committed by his father against his mother.
Douglas County District Judge Jeffrey Holmes acknowledged that McKinney had suffered ""serious trauma,"" but declined in a seven-page order to move the case.
“Based on the totality of the evidence before it, the Court finds that it is has not been proved that the juvenile and the community would be better served by transferring this case to juvenile court,” Holmes wrote.
If convicted of the murder charge at trial, McKinney faces up to 40 years in prison. Had the case been sent to juvenile court, the maximum sentence he could have received is seven years.
The Colorado Public Defender’s Office, which represents McKinney, does not speak to the media about its cases.
A spokeswoman for District Attorney George Brauchler said he had no immediate comment.
Erickson was bound over for trial in September and is scheduled to enter a plea on Friday.
Since he was 18 at the time of the shooting, Erickson could face the death penalty or a mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole if he is convicted of the murder.
According to court documents, McKinney and Erickson armed themselves with three handguns and a 22-caliber rifle and took cocaine before carrying out the rampage.
McKinney told police he was in a “pre-op transitioning phase” and planned the shooting as revenge against classmates who bullied him for being transgender, according to an arrest affidavit."

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Anti-government protests in Haiti are waning, with schools and businesses trying to re-open in the face of political gridlock and heightened violence in the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.
Demonstrations began in September against President Jovenel Moise over allegations of corruption and mismanagement, paralyzing the Caribbean island nation of 11 million. Protesters have barricaded roads and the electrical grid has broken down, plunging much of the island into darkness. Gangs have profited from the chaos to expand their territory. 
Haitians have wearied of disruptions, and crowds at recent protests are down to the hundreds from tens of thousands at the height of the crisis. The political opposition insists that the government has lost control of the country.
Yet many question whether the opposition can dislodge the president. Washington has pledged Haiti more aid, and U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale is expected to arrive on Friday.
Attempts to return to normalcy have been tentative and precarious.
Hawkers are returning to sell wares on town sidewalks. Schools are re-starting some classes, mostly at reduced hours. With the sound of gunfire still common, pupils have been urged not to wear uniforms that would aggravate protesters.
""We are afraid of reprisals,"" said Rosette Romelus, director at a primary and secondary school in Port-au-Prince. ""Parents are stressed as well as the pupils ... When parents heard shots this morning they left with their children.""
A nearby high-school for girls re-opened only for two classes studying for exams. The mood was tense, as shots were heard in the distance.
""We don't want to increase the number of pupils yet because of the political situation,"" said Mackenson Bonhomme, an administrative staff member. ""We cannot guarantee the safety of the children.""
""We're afraid of missing a year of school,"" said Kerlange Augustin, 16, disappointed that her class was not returning.
Several school directors said they hoped all classes would restart in January. Almost all Haitian schools are private, and some parents say they lack money for fees because the crisis has prevented them from working. 
ANOTHER MARCH PLANNED
So far, police have only been able to unblock highways temporarily. Barricades have been re-erected leaving provinces cut off.
Some opposition factions are calling for a demonstration on Thursday in the northern town of Gonaives and a march on Friday in the capital to the U.S. embassy to demand Washington stop propping up the government.
""I do not understand why the international community continues to back a head of state who cannot guarantee the stability of his country and who is rejected by his people,"" top opposition leader Andre Michel told Reuters.
Moise, whose election came with fraud allegations and a voter turnout of just 21%, has vowed to serve until his mandate ends in 2021. Fuel shortages sparked this latest wave of protests, the worst by far since demonstrations began in mid-2018.
Haitians are frustrated with frequent blackouts, while inflation has surged to around 20 percent, leaving foodstuffs and other goods out of reach for many. 
The opposition rejected Moise's offer of a unity government, and has blocked appointment of a prime minister, leaving Haiti unable to unlock needed funds from the International Monetary Fund and other sources.
Authorities have failed to organize new parliamentary elections. From January there will be no legislative body, meaning Moise will rule by executive decree. Many fear the government must limp along as the crisis worsens.

""Transition imposes itself,"" opposition leader Michel said, ""and if not today, then tomorrow.""

Jo Swinson repeated her pledge not to put either the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn or Prime Minister Boris Johnson into power if neither wins a majority in parliament.
""I will vote for legislation to pass a people’s vote, of course I will, and I would have done that under the previous Conservative government, just as I would do under any other government,"" she told the BBC, referring to a second referendum on membership of the European Union (EU) proposed by Labour.
Asked if she would support Labour in an effort to stop Britain leaving the EU if there was a hung parliament, she said she would, provided that Corbyn was no longer its leader.
""I have said that Liberal Democrat votes won't put Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10,"" she said.
""Liberal Democrats will work to stop Brexit, we will support legislation that puts in place a people’s vote and we will work across parties.""
She also pledged not to resign if her party loses seats in the election.
The Liberal Democrats, who cast themselves as the only ‘Stop Brexit’ party, trail the Conservatives and Labour in opinion polls and are expected to fall a long way short of winning the election outright. But they could have an important role if neither the Conservatives nor Labour win a majority and have to find a partner in order to form a government."

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea told the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday that it would consider any discussion of the country's human rights situation a ""serious provocation"" and Pyongyang would ""respond strongly.""
North Korea's U.N. ambassador Kim Song delivered the warning in a letter, which was seen by Reuters. Diplomats said several members of the 15-member council planned to request a meeting this month on human rights abuses in North Korea.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since June last year in a bid to broker a deal that Washington hopes will lead to North Korea dismantling its nuclear and missile programs. But no progress had been made and Pyongyang has carried out a series of short range ballistic missile tests.
The United States is president of the Security Council for December. 
Kim Song wrote that any meeting on human rights would be an ""act of conniving at and siding with the U.S.' hostile policy, which will lead to undermining rather than helping reduction of tensions on the Korean Peninsula and resolution of the nuclear issue."" 
A minimum nine council members need to support a request for the meeting in order to defeat any attempt to block it. Between 2014 and 2017 China failed to stop the annual discussion.
Last year the United States dropped a push for the council to meet on human rights because it did not have enough support, diplomats said. They could have tried again in January when five new members rotated onto the council, but they did not.
North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of human rights abuses and blames sanctions for a dire humanitarian situation. It demands they be removed. Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.
""If the Security Council would push through the meeting on 'human rights issue' of the DPRK ... the situation on the Korean Peninsula would take a turn for the worse again,"" the letter said.
North Korea has given Washington until the end of the year to show more flexibility in talks, raising concerns among some diplomats that it could next year resume nuclear and long-range missile testing that has been suspended since 2017.
Trump has repeatedly held up this suspension of tests as a major achievement of his engagement with North Korea. 

A 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.

The relationship between Washington and Khartoum has improved since the overthrow in April of President Omar al-Bashir and the formation of a civilian transitional government in August.
The announcement that the two countries would begin the process of exchanging ambassadors again came during Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's first visit to Washington on Wednesday. 
""This decision is a meaningful step forward in strengthening the U.S.-Sudan bilateral relationship, particularly as the civilian-led transitional government works to implement the vast reforms under the political agreement and constitutional declaration of August 17, 2019,"" Pompeo said in a statement praising Hamdok.
The prime minister discussed strengthening ties between the United States and Sudan during his meeting in Washington with David Hale, the U.S. State Department undersecretary for political affairs.
""After a 23-year interruption, it is great to see the start of the ambassadors exchange operation between Sudan and the United States of America. This is an important step towards rebuilding Sudan,"" Hamdok said on Twitter after the meeting.
Washington and Khartoum had been at odds for decades. The U.S. government added Sudan to its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1993 over allegations that Bashir's Islamist government was supporting terrorist groups, a designation that makes Sudan technically ineligible for debt relief and financing from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. 
Last month, a senior State Department official said the United States may remove Sudan from the list and that the two countries no longer had an adversarial relationship. Congress needs to approve such a removal.
Months of demonstrations over price hikes for fuel and bread and cash shortages led to an uprising against Bashir, who was toppled by the military in April.

Sudan's transitional government was formed in August and it agreed with the United States that it could start engaging with international institutions while still on a list of countries deemed sponsors of terrorism.

UNITED NATIONS/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil is in danger of losing its vote at the cash-strapped United Nations if it does not pay some of the $400 million it owes by the end of the year, U.N. and Brazilian officials said. 
Of Brazil's $415.8 million bill, $143 million is owed for 2019, they said.
Under U.N. rules, if a country is in arrears in an amount that equals or exceeds the contributions due for the previous two years, it can lose its General Assembly vote unless the country can show its inability to pay is beyond its control. 
""There is considerable risk that Brazil, for the first time ever, will lose its right to vote at the U.N. as of January 1, 2020,"" the Economy Ministry's secretary for international relations Erivaldo Gomes said in a report seen by Reuters.
Brazil is the second-largest U.N. debtor after the United States and must pay at least $126.6 million by the end of the year to avoid losing its vote, Gomes wrote in the report.
The Economy Ministry said in an email to Reuters that it asked Congress on Tuesday to approve 549 million reais ($130 million) in supplementary funding to cover Brazil's U.N. dues.
Currently Comoros, Sao Tome and Principe, and Somalia are subject to this rule but the 193-member General Assembly voted in October to allow them to continue to vote.
The United Nations said in October that total arrears were $1.385 billion, of which $860 million is for the $2.85 billion regular budget for 2019, which pays for work including political, humanitarian, disarmament, economic and social affairs and communications. 
U.N. officials said then that seven countries made up 97% of $1.385 billion owed - the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Iran, Israel and Venezuela - while 58 states made up the rest.
Washington is responsible for 22% of the regular budget and in October owed some $381 million for prior regular budgets and $674 million for the 2019 regular budget.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday that the United States had since paid some $500 million to the world body and now owed about $491 million.
Dujarric said 138 of the 193 U.N. member states had now paid their regular budget dues, but that some $772 million was still owed for 2019.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 02:37PM ET</span>",Middleman tells Malta court of plot to kill reporter,"By Crispian Balmer
VALLETTA (Reuters) - The self-confessed middleman in the murder of a journalist told a court on Wednesday a wealthy Maltese businessman was the brains behind the killing but also implicated people tied to government in the growing scandal.
Melvin Theuma received immunity from prosecution last week for information that would lead to the conviction of alleged plot leader and multi-millionaire entrepreneur Yorgen Fenech.
However, his detailed court deposition raised fresh questions over the inner circle of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, with Theuma linking apparent attempts at a cover-up of the 2017 murder to figures inside government headquarters.
Fenech has been charged with complicity over the killing of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia by a car bomb. He has denied the accusations and blamed former government chief of staff Keith Schembri and other senior officials.
Schembri was arrested last month but later released. He has denied involvement in the murder which has highlighted allegations of rampant corruption in Malta's overlapping worlds of politics and business.
Theuma gave a detailed account of how the 38-year-old Fenech contacted him in 2017 to organize the hit, providing 150,000 euros ($165,000) for the contract.
The plot was put on hold before elections in June 2017 but reactivated the night the ruling Labour party was returned to power, Theuma told a packed courtroom.
""I can assure you, Yorgen Fenech was the only mastermind. Only he spoke to me,"" said Theuma, a taxi driver with links to the criminal underworld.
Fenech wanted Caruana Galizia dead because he thought she was going to publish an incriminating story about his uncle, Theuma said.
He said he was called to government headquarters after agreeing to arrange the assassination and that Schembri gave him a tour of the building, where Muscat's offices are housed. 
Muscat has denied any wrongdoing but has acknowledged he could have handled the aftermath better and said he will step down next month.
PANIC
Theuma was subsequently told he had been put on the government payroll and received a paycheck for three or four months. ""If you asked me, I wouldn't know what my job was at the ministry, as I never went,"" he said.
He said he paid three local men to carry out the killing. Thanks partly to help provided by the U.S. FBI, the trio were later arrested, and are awaiting trial, having pleaded not guilty. They sat in court on Wednesday stony-faced.
Theuma recounted his panic after the alleged triggermen were seized and news emerged that one was cooperating with police.
He said he was then contacted again by an employee from government headquarters whom he named as Kenneth. In an apparent attempt to buy their silence, Kenneth said the three suspects would be released on bail and given 1 million euros, though the bail did not arrive, Theuma said.
Theuma said he asked Fenech whether Schembri had sent Kenneth to him, but got no answer. Scared for his safety, he started making secret recordings of his conversations with the businessman, which he has given police.
""I started to think they would either lock me up or kill me,"" he said. He also acknowledged writing a note where he said both Schembri and Fenech ordered the hit. In court, he distanced himself from the accusation against Schembri, making clear he had no evidence. 
A police source later identified Kenneth as Kenneth Camilleri, who used to work in Muscat's security detail. He was recently transferred to Transport Malta, a government body. The company said on Wednesday it had suspended one of its employees following Theuma's deposition, without giving details.
Camilleri did not respond to a message from Reuters requesting comment.
With Malta under scrutiny, the new head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, urged a thorough investigation without political interference. ""It is crucial that all those responsible are put to justice as soon as possible,"" she said. 
A European Parliament delegation, which has spent two days in Malta to review rule of law within the EU's smallest member, recommended that Muscat go immediately.
""There has to be absolute confidence in the (investigation) and I think when he is in office, that confidence is not there,"" said Sophie In't Veld, a Dutch member of parliament who led the mission.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 02:06PM ET</span>",Not so nasty: NATO avoids a car crash summit,"By Robin Emmott and Michel Rose
WATFORD, England (Reuters) - It was shaping up for a repeat of NATO's disastrous summit of July 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed a tirade against European allies and threatened to pull America out of the transatlantic military alliance forged after World War Two.
French President Emmanuel Macron had stunned other leaders in the run-up to Wednesday's meeting in a country estate on the outskirts of London by declaring that NATO was ""experiencing brain death"", a comment Trump branded ""very, very nasty"".
But at their three-hour session, the leaders agreed to appoint a group of experts to conduct a strategic review over two years to prepare the Western alliance for the future - and as they headed home there was little evidence of the public acrimony that had preceded their summit.
Diplomats said the ""brain-death"" debate was key to avoiding a bust-up, possibly spurring Trump to take a more positive view of the alliance than he has in the past.
Amid the consternation over Macron's comment, France and Germany last month proposed a study of NATO's future by a group of ""wise men"". Their idea was vague but, according to a senior NATO diplomat, alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg seized on it to take some heat out of the summit.
""It was very useful,"" an adviser to Macron said. ""Had he not sparked this debate, they would have come here, raised a toast to the Queen and ... gone home even though we're going through a challenging international moment.""
Macron himself told reporters the outcome of the summit had ""demonstrated the usefuleness of our comments"", and likened himself to an ice-breaking ship cutting through frozen seas.
""It leaves broken ice but it also opens a passage,"" he said.
""A MILDER TRUMP""
Diplomats put the meeting's relative success down to the behavior of Trump, who throughout the 2018 summit had questioned the value of NATO in tweets and berated allies for not spending enough on defense.
Aside from a complaint that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was ""two-faced"" after a hot mic caught him mocking the U.S. president, diplomats said Trump was unusually conciliatory.
In a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel he complained mildly that Berlin was ""a little bit under"" the target for NATO allies to spend 2% of their GDP on defense.
""I can only say that we had a good discussion on substance,"" Merkel told reporters. ""We had room for other, more strategic questions. I had the impression that mutual understanding of the different geographical situations is growing.""
One European diplomat said ""we saw a very mild Trump"", and another said he was ""more a team-player than a disruptor"".
U.S. officials said Trump has been placated by increases in defense spending by NATO allies, and other leaders appear to have learnt to deal with his mercurial nature at such events.
Trump faces impeachment troubles at home and must gird for what is expected to be a tough battle for re-election next year.
""Would it be in his interest to start international clashes in a context of domestic political campaign? I don't think that would pay off,"" the second diplomat said.
Once a relic of the Cold War, and long criticized for failing to meet security challenges such as global terrorism, the alliance found new resolve on its eastern flank after Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
But Turkey's October operation into Syria, against allies' wishes, and Trump's zig-zagging position on NATO have led diplomats to question the alliance's broader strategy.
In their final statement, leaders said they were ""taking into account the evolving strategic environment"" and tasked Stoltenberg to report back, probably next April, with plans ""for a forward-looking reflection process"".
Ideas raised by diplomats include developing NATO's original remit, since its 1949 foundation, of protecting Europe and North America, to potentially encompass new areas such as Syria's eight-year-old civil war and the Middle East.
Some diplomats said the reflection risks being long and it could turn NATO into another political club with no legislative powers, making statements about conflicts beyond its control.
However, Paris and Berlin say that want an alliance that is more agile, and Trump - who once described NATO as ""obsolete"" - praised it at the summit as more ""flexible""."
1029,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 01:43PM ET</span>",Greece 'registers disagreement' with Libya-Turkey maritime accord,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece said on Wednesday it opposed an accord reached by Turkey and Libya to define their maritime boundaries, but said it and Ankara - both members of NATO - were committed to talks on confidence-building measures.
Libya and Turkey signed an agreement on boundaries in the Mediterranean last week that could complicate Ankara's disputes over offshore energy exploration in the Mediterranean with nations including Greece.
Greece and Turkey are at odds over various decades-old issues ranging from mineral rights in the Aegean Sea to ethnically-split Cyprus. The deal with Libya angered Greece, which sees the move as infringing its own sovereign rights.
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis met Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in Britain on Wednesday on the sidelines of a NATO summit.
""I raised all issues relating to the latest Turkish actions,"" Mitsotakis said in a statement. ""The disagreements of both sides were recorded. The two sides however agreed to continue discussions on confidence building measures.""
There was no immediate comment from the Turkish side.
The accord between Turkey and Libya's internationally recognised government, which mapped out a sea area between the two countries, was signed on Nov. 27.
Libya’s neighbor Egypt dismissed the deal as “illegal” as did Cyprus, while Greece has said any such accord would be geographically absurd because it ignored the presence of the Greek island of Crete between the coasts of Turkey and Libya.
Greece has warned Libya's ambassador to Athens that if he failed to provide clarifications to the Greek government over the deal he could be expelled, a Greek government spokesman said on Tuesday.
""I want to reassure the Greek people that difficulties with Turkey existed, exist and will exist. But I assess that, provided the two sides show goodwill, these will be overcome,"" Mitsotakis said.
Tensions are already running high between Athens and Ankara because of Turkish drilling in the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Cyprus, and the European Union has prepared sanctions against Turkey in response."

SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Bulgaria on Wednesday of deliberately delaying the building of Russia's TurkStream natural gas pipeline on its territory and said Moscow could find ways to bypass Sofia if needed.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov denied any deliberate delays. He said construction started late - three months ago - as Sofia follows European Union procurement rules that ensure the project would not be blocked by Brussels.
Russia is building TurkStream in two lines, with 15.75 billion cubic metres (bcm) annual capacity each; the first leg is aimed at supplying Turkey and the second one would run further from Bulgaria to Serbia and Hungary.
Russia plans to start the first line next month but the launch of the second one depends on building the requisite gas infrastructure by Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary. TurkStream and Nord Stream 2 are essential for Moscow to continue gas exports to Europe as Russia wants to suspend transit via Ukraine.
Speaking at a joint news conference with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic in the Russian Black Sea resort town of Sochi, Putin said Bulgaria was ""deliberately"" delaying implementing the TurkStream on its soil.
""If the Bulgarian leadership does not want it (TurkStream to run via its territory) we will find another ways to implement it in southern Europe,"" he said, without elaborating.
Speaking to Bulgaria's private BTV television, Borissov said his government was speeding the pipeline construction and invited Putin to visit and see for himself.
""Everyone has the right to seek alternative routes. We are looking for an alternative diversification. Besides, probably politically they are not very pleased that Bulgaria is such a loyal, strong member of NATO and the European Union,"" he said.
""My answer to President Putin is that he is welcome to visit and see the speed with which we are building, averagely 5 km per day. We started late, because many procedures had to be carried out ...We follow EU rules, that why it is certain that we will build it,"" he said.
In September, Bulgaria signed a 1.1-billion-euro ($1.21 billion) contract with Saudi-led group Arkad to build the 474-km pipeline across its territory.
Sofia initially planned to have the pipeline built as early as January, but given that the contract with Arkad was signed only three months ago, it has pushed the timeline back to have it operational by the end of next May. Bulgaria plans to ship Russian gas partially using its existing infrastructure until the entire length of the new pipeline is ready by end-2020."

KABUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad arrived in Kabul on Wednesday in a bid to breath new life into efforts to end the war in Afghanistan, discussing with President Ashraf Ghani steps that could lead to a ceasefire and a peace deal, Washington and Kabul said. 
After his visit to Kabul, Khalilzad will to fly to Qatar to meet Taliban negotiators, the State Department said.
The Qatar meeting appeared to be a continuation of several weeks of informal talks and not a resumption of the formal negotiations on a U.S. troop withdrawal accord that U.S. President Donald Trump terminated in September.
""The two sides will rejoin the discussion on how to reduce violence,"" said a State Department spokeswoman. 
Trump canceled the formal negotiations as the sides neared a deal for withdrawal of thousands of U.S. troops in return for Taliban assurances that al Qaeda and other militant groups did not use Afghanistan as a base to attack the United States and its allies.
The deal would have been followed by negotiations on a political settlement between the Taliban and a delegation of government officials, civil society leaders and others. 
Trump met Ghani during a surprise Thanksgiving visit to U.S. forces at Bagram Airfield last week, raising hopes for resumption of efforts to end the insurgency the Taliban have waged since being ousted from power by the 2001 U.S.-led invasion.
The chances of reviving negotiations, however, remain doubtful. The Taliban has refused to engage with what they denounce as Ghani's ""illegitimate puppet regime,"" and rejected a ceasefire while talks are underway.
Kabul says it is ready to revive talks. But it has rejected the previous format under which Khalilzad excluded Afghan officials from U.S. troop withdrawal negotiations.
Afghan officials also are pressing for a sequence that would see a ceasefire, direct talks with the Taliban and a security guarantee, and only then U.S. troop withdrawals - a formula that Taliban leaders strongly reject.
""We will not announce any ceasefire before a deal with the U.S., and secondly we will not agree to hold any meetings with the Afghan government before that,"" a senior Taliban official told Reuters.
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment. 
Khalilzad and Ghani discussed issues ""pertaining to a ceasefire as well as the issue of the Taliban's sanctuaries outside of Afghanistan,"" a government statement said, referring to the insurgents' safe haven in Pakistan.
Khalilzad appeared to be seeking a ceasefire formula acceptable to the Taliban, who previously agreed only to a reduction in violence.

He will discuss with the Taliban ""steps that could lead to intra-Afghan negotiations and a peaceful settlement of the war, specifically a reduction in violence that leads to a ceasefire,"" the State Department said.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 01:04PM ET</span>",Hospital groups file lawsuit to block Trump's price transparency rule,"(Reuters) - U.S. hospital groups have challenged the Trump administration's rule that requires them to be more transparent about prices they charge patients for healthcare services, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday.
The plaintiffs, including the nonprofit American Hospital Association (AHA), are looking to block the rule issued last month that mandates hospitals to publish pricing information of their services on the internet. 
""The rule ... does not provide the information patients need. Mandating the public disclosure of negotiated charges would create confusion about patients' out-of-pocket costs, not prevent it,"" the plaintiffs said. 
The rule, seen as a violation of the First Amendment by the hospital groups, also demands confidential information on individually negotiated contract terms with all third-party payers, including private commercial health insurers.
Such disclosures would eliminate hospitals' ability to negotiate pricing with insurers that would undermine competition and blunt incentives for health insurers to sign arrangements that could potentially lower costs, the plaintiffs said.
This is not the first time that the industry has challenged President Donald Trump's efforts to lower drug prices.
In July, a federal judge sided with drugmakers by striking down a rule that would have forced pharmaceutical companies to include the wholesale prices of their drugs in television advertisements.
""Hospitals should be ashamed that they aren't willing to provide American patients the cost of a service before they purchase it,"" said Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, adding that the administration would continue to fight for price transparency.
The AHA, along with the Association Of American Medical Colleges and Federation Of American Hospitals, among others, said it would press for speeding up the decision on the rule, so hospitals do not spend time and resources preparing for what may be invalidated.

The rule is expected to come into effect on January 1, 2021.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 12:42PM ET</span>","After 20 years, Palestinian mother and son reunited in Egypt","CAIRO (Reuters) - Palestinian journalist Amjad Yaghi was just nine years old when his mother left the Gaza Strip on what should have been a short trip to Egypt for medical treatment.
But until a joyful reunion this week, they did not see each other again for 20 years.
After leaving Gaza in 1999, Yaghi's mother, Nevine Zouheir, could not return to Gaza because of spinal disc pain for which she needs surgery. 
Despite 14 attempts to go to see her, Yaghi was unable to get out of Gaza after the militant group Hamas took control of the territory in 2007 and Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade that included travel restrictions.
Though he was invited to attend several conferences abroad, he received travel clearance only after they ended, leaving him without a valid reason to cross the border.
Yaghi was finally granted a visa to enter Egypt via Jordan, and made his way to his mother's apartment in the Nile Delta town of Banha on Monday.
When she saw him from her balcony, Zouheir cried out her son's name. She went to the bottom of the stairwell to embrace him and they held hands as they walked up to the apartment. 
""It was very difficult, knowing you could die without having realized your dreams, without having seen your family, your mother,"" said Yaghi, who was wounded in 2009 in armed conflict with Israel. 
""In all of these situations, you need a mother. Yes, okay, I am 29 years old. But I need a mother beside me,"" he said. ""I have relatives who are all great, but a mother is important in a country which lives under occupation.""
Citing security concerns, Israel maintains tight controls on Palestinian movement in and out of Gaza, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.

Egypt only occasionally opens a border crossing at the city of Rafah to allow certain people through, such as holders of foreign passports, students and those in need of medical treatment.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 12:26PM ET</span>","Lebanon to convene talks on new PM on Monday, looks set to nominate Khatib","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Sunni businessman Samir Khatib looks set to be nominated as Lebanon's next prime minister when consultations with lawmakers to name a premier are held on Monday, political sources said on Wednesday.
More than a month since Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister, prompted by protests against the ruling elite, President Michel Aoun scheduled the binding consultations with MPs to designate the new premier on Monday.
Lebanon is deep in the throes of an economic crisis that has shaken confidence in the country's banks and worsened since the protests erupted on Oct. 17. It needs a new government to enact urgent reforms to get the economy back on track.
Lawmakers from the Future Movement, which is headed by Sunni politician Hariri, as well as powerful Shi'ite groups Hezbollah and Amal are all expected to back him at the consultations, sources familiar with their positions said.
With the support of Lebanon's main Sunni and Shi'ite Muslim political forces and no other declared candidate so far, Khatib appeared under the current circumstances likely to win the nomination.
Several hundred protesters blocked one side of a main roadway in central Beirut following Aoun's call for consultations. Some protesters have rejected Khatib's candidacy and consider him part of an elite they have sought to oust. 
Hariri said last week that he did not wish to return as prime minister of a new government, which will face the worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war.
Efforts to agree a new government have been mired in political differences between Hariri, who is aligned with Western and Gulf Arab states, and the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies, including Aoun.
Hezbollah, which had more influence in the Hariri-led cabinet than any previous administration, has accused the United States of meddling in the formation of a new Lebanese government. It had backed Hariri's return.
Hariri had been willing to return as prime minister but on condition he could lead a cabinet of expert ministers he believed would be best placed to steer Lebanon out of crisis, win international support, and satisfy protesters.
But Hezbollah and its allies, including Aoun, had insisted the cabinet be a mix of technocrats and politicians. 
Hariri said on Tuesday that he backed Khatib to head the next cabinet but added that ""some details"" still had to be hashed out. He said his party would only name technocrats as ministers.
Aoun is constitutionally required to designate the candidate with the greatest support among Lebanon's 128 lawmakers. The prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim according to Lebanon's sectarian system of government. 
Ali Hassan Khalil, a senior figure in Amal, told reporters the government would most likely comprise 24 ministers and it would be up to each party to name a political representative in the cabinet or not. 
Khatib's candidacy appeared to suffer a setback earlier on Wednesday when three former prime ministers criticized the talks around Khatib, saying they had violated the constitution. The former ministers have supported Hariri's return.
Khatib is executive vice-president and partner of Khatib & Alami, a construction and contracting business with projects in countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and North Africa, according to its website.
He has no track record in Lebanon's sectarian politics but is known to have good ties with many of the main parties, including Saad al-Hariri and his late father, Rafik, who was assassinated in 2005.
His daughter is married to Major General Abbas Ibrahim, the Shi'ite head of Lebanon's most powerful internal security agency, General Security. He is seen to have good ties with Lebanon's main parties and Arab countries.
He is also seen as well-connected in the Arab world.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy has increased relocation of migrants around Europe, official figures showed on Wednesday, reducing frictions around the issue and enabling far-right leader Matteo Salvini to steer his focus more onto the economy.
Interior Ministry data showed that 172 migrants who came onshore from the Mediterranean were sent elsewhere in the last three months, compared to just 90 in the January-August period.
Immigration has been one of Italy's most contentious issues and fueled the rise of Salvini's League party, which ruled in coalition with the 5-Star Movement from mid-2018 until August.
The new administration signed an agreement to distribute migrants saved from the Mediterranean around the European Union (EU) to ease pressure on southern states.
Salvini's replacement as interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese is a technocrat with no party affiliation, and has established better relations with European partners.
""European countries prefer the current government and interior minister to Salvini, who constantly accused them,"" said Gianfranco Pasquino, an analyst from Bologna University.
During his time in office, Salvini sought to block Italy's ports to charity migrant rescue ships. Those noisy standoffs are over, though the new government of the 5-Star and the centre-left Democratic Party has not repealed his laws.
With EU countries offering to take 82% of migrants qualified for relocation, pressure on Italy has eased and Salvini has shifted his focus. Now he leads opposition to reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which he says could jeopardize citizens' savings with restructuring of Italy's debt.
Polls show the League remains Italy's most popular party.
""Salvini jumps on every issue the government has difficulties with, the ESM (reform) is perfect. He will wait for other occasions and will try to exploit them,"" Pasquino added.
Italy's immigration problems are, however, far from over.
Arrivals may have halved from last year to 10,960 so far in 2019, according to government data. But there are still 95,000 migrants in Italian centers and more than 1,000 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year, the International Organisation for Migration says."
1036,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 11:39AM ET</span>","Long focused on Russia, NATO widens gaze toward China","By Phil Stewart and Robin Emmott
WATFORD, England (Reuters) - Seventy years since its Cold War-era founding as a transatlantic alliance focused on Moscow, NATO is expanding its gaze toward the increasingly muscular challenge posed by China.
But it is unclear, even to diplomats within the 29-member military alliance, whether NATO is up to the task - especially at a time of intense internal divisions and acrimony that were on full display heading into this week's summit.
In a statement issued after they met on the outskirts of London on Wednesday, NATO leaders said: ""We recognize that China's growing influence and international policies present both opportunities and challenges that we need to address together as an Alliance.""
The United States is leading the charge for a greater focus on China and is confident of a receptive audience in much of Europe, where concerns are mounting about Beijing's growing economic leverage, in particular.
In a shift in tone earlier this year, the European Commission, the European Union's executive, described China as a ""systemic rival"" and urged the bloc to be more assertive after years of welcoming Chinese investment virtually unhindered.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, in an interview with Reuters, said there was an increasing understanding in Europe about the challenges posed by China's rapidly expanding military might, which includes everything from hypersonic weaponry to aircraft carriers.
""China is a strategic challenge for us and we need to get ahead of that,"" Esper said.
""That doesn't mean that China right now is an enemy. But we need to help shape that together as an alliance. And we need to be prepared in case things do turn out in a way we prefer they not.""
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg noted ahead of the alliance's summit that China was the world's second-largest defense spender, after the United States.
""It's not about moving NATO into the South China Sea, but it's about taking into account the fact that China is coming to closer to us,"" he said, pointing to Chinese activity in the Arctic, Africa and heavy investments in European infrastructure.
The United States, in particular, wants European allies to ban equipment from Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei, saying its gear could be used by Beijing for spying.
Huawei, which denies Washington's allegations, said in October that half of the 65 commercial deals that it had signed were with European customers building 5G mobile phone networks.
The NATO leaders said in their communique that they were committed to ensuring their countries had secure 5G communications, without mentioning Huawei.
Trump, however, referred directly to Huawei as ""a security danger"", telling a news conference he had assurances from Italy and other countries that they would not pursue deals with the company. 
NATO'S NEXT ADVERSARY?
One NATO diplomat said there was broad agreement that China was ""part of our strategic environment"" but cautioned about the limits of European unity on the push.
""Some allies would be tempted to please Trump and present China as NATO's next adversary, but most Europeans know this does not represent their national interest,"" the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Another diplomat cautioned that China would not become NATO's adversary.
""China is not the new Russia. This is not about declaring China as the new enemy,"" the diplomat said. ""China is the rising power of the 21st century.""
Derek Chollet, a former senior Pentagon official during the Obama administration, said European officials increasingly share the U.S. view of China as a strategic challenge but questioned the extent to which Beijing would become a NATO focus.
""No question there is an opportunity,"" said Chollet, who is now at the German Marshall Fund think-tank. ""It is unlikely, however, to ever be a core NATO task.""
Part of the China plan at NATO is based around seven baseline requirements on which NATO allies must assess the risks. These include the risks of consequences of Chinese ownership of communications and NATO plans to restore communications in case of disruption.

It also includes ensuring NATO has ownership of strategic weapons and infrastructure and what NATO's maritime posture should be vis-à-vis China.

WATFORD, England (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called Justin Trudeau ""two-faced"" on Wednesday after the Canadian Prime Minister appeared to be caught on camera joking about his press appearances during a chat with other leaders at a NATO summit in Britain.
Trudeau was filmed at a Buckingham Palace reception for NATO leaders on Tuesday evening describing how surprised U.S. officials appeared to be by Trump's performance at an earlier news conference.
The conversation, which involved Trudeau, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Queen Elizabeth's daughter Anne, was recorded on video and snippets were audible. 
""Is that why you were late?"" Johnson asked Macron.
""...It was like a 40-minute press conference,"" Trudeau said. ""Yeah, yeah, yeah! Forty minutes.""
Other words were exchanged but could not be heard, before Trudeau added with a chuckle: ""I just watched his team's jaws drop to the floor.""
Asked on Wednesday if he had heard Trudeau's remarks about him, Trump said: ""He's two-faced"". 
He suggested that Trudeau was upset because he had challenged him for failing to meet the target of spending 2% of national output on defense. 
""I find him to be a very nice guy but you know the truth is that I called him out over the fact that he's not paying 2% and I can see he's not very happy about it,"" Trump said at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Trump later appeared to make light of his own remarks about Trudeau.
""That was funny when I said the guy's two-faced,"" the president was caught saying on an audio clip following a lunch with some of the NATO leaders.
At a final news conference, Trudeau played down the incident, saying he and Trump had enjoyed a great meeting and that the jaw-dropping comment was a reference to the announcement of the location of the next meeting of G7 leaders at the U.S. presidential retreat, Camp David.
""Last night, I made a reference to the fact there was an unscheduled press conference before my meeting with President Trump, I was happy to take part in it but it was certainly notable,"" Trudeau told reporters. 

""We were all surprised and I think pleased to learn that the next G7 will be at Camp David, I think that was an unscheduled announcement and... I think every different leader has teams who every now and then their jaws drop at unscheduled surprises, like that video itself for example.""

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 11:13AM ET</span>",Algeria tries top figures for corruption as opposed election looms,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria began the corruption trial of senior officials including two former prime ministers on Wednesday, a week before a presidential election opposed by a huge protest movement.
Fighting corruption in the entrenched ruling hierarchy is one of the main goals of the protesters, but they have not yet been mollified by the arrest of dozens of senior figures including officials, former officials and businessmen.
Wednesday's trial is the second of top figures since the start of the protest movement in February, with long prison terms handed to a former spy chief and other once powerful figures in October.
It comes at a pivotal moment in the months-long struggle between the large but leaderless protest movement, known as the ""Herak"", and the military-backed authorities.
Next week's election has been pushed by the army as the only way to end the standoff with the opposition, but the protesters have rejected the vote, saying it cannot be free or fair while the ruling elite, including the military, stay in power.
The Herak had already been mobilizing tens of thousands of demonstrators every Friday for months, but since the start of the official campaign period, it has also begun protests on other days, ramping up pressure on the authorities.
Though the demonstrations have so far been mostly free from violence, there was some scuffling between protesters and riot police during a march in an eastern town last week and the government has started arresting more opposition figures.
On Tuesday, Interior Minister Salah Eddine Dahmoune attacked people opposing the election as ""traitors, mercenaries and homosexuals"".
He later said his comments were aimed at people based overseas, rather than at the protest movement, but many supporters of the Herak were angered.
""The remarks will only complicate things,"" said Ahmed Bachichi, who has been taking part in the weekly protests.
In the court on Wednesday, former prime ministers Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal faced charges of ""misappropriation of public funds, abuse of office and granting undue privileges"".
They and most of the other officials and businessmen on trial were closely linked to the former president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was forced from office in April.
Wednesday's session included evidence of corruption in the car assembly business, a sector encouraged by the government after 2015 in an effort to improve the trade balance in response to lower energy revenue.
""You acted with favoritism when you granted authorizations to set up car assemblies,"" the judge told Ouyahia, who denied the charge, saying all permits were granted in accordance with the law.
The prosecution accused Sellal, who was campaign manager for Bouteflika when he planned to stand for another term of office early in the year, of involvement in illegal funding of the campaign. He denied it.
No verdict is expected in the trial this week."

""When today's meetings are over, I will be heading back to Washington,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""We won't be doing a press conference at the close of NATO because we did so many over the past two days. Safe travels to all!""
The cancellation came as the second phase of Congressional impeachment hearings was due to start at 1500 GMT in Washington.
Trump said he would hold final bilateral meetings with Denmark and Italy at the golf resort near London where the military alliance has gathered for its 70th anniversary before returning to the United States.
Divisions in the 29-member NATO club alliance were laid bare in preliminary meetings in London on Tuesday, with Trump criticizing French President Emmanuel Macron for comments last month about NATO's strategic ""brain death"" and describing allies who spent too little on defense as ""delinquent"".
Justin Trudeau was then labeled ""two faced"" by Trump on Wednesday, after comments the Canadian prime minister appeared to make about him at a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace the previous evening.
Trudeau was filmed describing to a group including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, how surprised U.S. officials appeared to be by Trump's performance at an earlier news conference.

Globes reported that Kahlon has told a number of different people of his intent to resign, although it said it was still unclear whether he would step down from the post of finance minister or just remove his name from running in the next parliamentary election.
A spokesman for Kahlon said there was ""nothing new"" in the report and declined to confirm or deny the resignation.
Kahlon has been finance minister since the country's 2015 election, when his upstart Kulanu party garnered 10 seats in parliament after promising to tackle soaring housing and other costs.
Kulanu dropped to four seats in an election in April, in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a ruling government. The party ran together with Netanyahu's Likud party but the combined entity fared worse in a subsequent election, losing a combined seven seats from April.
Netanyahu and rival Benny Gantz, the head of the Blue and White Party which received one more mandate than Netanyahu, have both been unable to so far form a government. If one is not formed soon, a third election is possible in early 2020."

Hundreds of Bosnian citizens are believed to have left Europe to fight for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and many are now in detention camps waiting to be handed over to their countries of origin.
""This week the return of 24 citizens of Bosnia is expected..., namely women and children of former fighters in Syria...This is a humane act, these are our people who stayed there,"" Komsic told reporters during a visit to Slovenia.
He said some children coming back were orphans, and that Bosnian authorities had done security checks on all returnees.
In October, Bosnia's security minister said the country was preparing to take back and try nine of its nationals suspected of fighting for Islamic State in Syria.
Their return was postponed after Turkey launched a military incursion into northeast Syria to fight Kurdish militia.
Under Bosnia's criminal code, citizens who leave to fight in foreign wars must be prosecuted under terrorism charges.
Bosnia's state court has tried and convicted 46 people who returned from Syria or Iraq over the past few years. Islamic State lost its last territorial foothold in Syria in March of this year and many of its militants are now believed to be in Kurdish-run prisons in northern Syria."

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia will take full control of its air space from Thursday for the first time ever after its 1990s war of independence led to a period of oversight by international peace forces.
Control over its air space was maintained by NATO-led peace forces from 1995 until 2003 when it was transferred to neighboring Serbia and Croatia while Bosnia built up and modernized its own system.
""This is the first time ever that Bosnia takes control of its air space and it is an enormous success, bearing in mind that (neighboring) Montenegro, a NATO member, does not control its own skies,"" Davorin Primorac, head of Bosnia's Air Navigation Services Agency (BHANSA), said on Wednesday. 
Bosnia took control of air space below 10,000 meters (33,000 feet) in 2014 following a 10-year project to establish its own air navigation management system and after the training of some 400 staff. Serbia and Croatia retained control above 10,000 meters just as they were doing when all three countries were republics in the old Yugoslav federation. 
Primorac said it had taken decades for Bosnia to take over its air space because its 1992-95 war, prompted by its secession from Yugoslavia, had devastated major infrastructure and equipment and left it short of skilled workers.
It took considerable time to train flight controllers, rebuild infrastructure and obtain necessary equipment, including radar systems, he said, adding that BHANSA intended to further upgrade its capacities.
Primorac said Bosnian flight controllers will oversee up to 1,600 flights on a busy day, eight times more than previously.
After taking over its air control service from Croatia and Serbia, BHANSA's budget would rise to 72.5 million Bosnian marka ($41 million) in 2020 from 60 million marka this year, he added.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of devout Hindus thronged a temple in southern Nepal where thousands of animals and birds were sacrificed this week, amid an outcry from animal rights activists who said the ritual was a cruel and gruesome spectacle. 
The ceremony, held every five years at the Gadhimai temple in Bara in southern Nepal, is believed to be the largest such mass-slaughter event in the world and animal rights activists have been campaigning to end the practice for years.
About 80% of Nepal's 30 million population are Hindus and many sacrifice animals to appease deities during festivals. Thousands of devotees also travel from India to sacrifice animals at the festival.
On Tuesday, devotees carrying swords and large curved knives called khukurs beheaded more than 3,000 buffaloes near the temple, witnesses said. Animal sacrifices continued on Wednesday when goats and other animals were slaughtered.
""There is no justification for this mass killing, and it is truly heartbreaking to witness,"" said Tanuja Basnet, director of the Nepal unit of Humane Society International, in a release that also called on the Nepal government to introduce a law banning animal sacrifice. 
In 2016, Nepal's Supreme Court said the practice should be prohibited, and it called on the government to frame a law that would gradually bring an end to the sacrifices.
Rajan Nepal, an official with Nepal's Tourism and Culture Ministry, told Reuters the government has begun to implement the court directive. 
""We've issued public appeals and consulted with stakeholders in the temple area,"" he said. ""It is related with tradition and cannot be halted immediately."" 
Devotees believe the sacrifice, meant to appease Gadhimai - an avatar of the Hindu goddess of power, Kali - brings them luck and prosperity.
Authorities deployed 1,100 police to prevent clashes between activists and devotees at the site 10 km (6 miles) from the Indian border.
""We can only try and convince devotees not to sacrifice the animals, but cannot force them to stop,"" said Bikash Khanal, the head of district police in Bara.
Khanal said fewer animals were sacrificed this year compared with five years ago due to awareness campaigns.
The heads of the sacrificed animals are buried in huge pits and hides and skins are often sold to traders. Some of the local communities also take the dead animals away for meat.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Lawyers representing victims of the Afghanistan conflict on Wednesday urged the International Criminal Court to allow a war crimes investigation that would include scrutinizing the actions of U.S. forces.
ICC judges in April rejected the request of prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to examine atrocities allegedly committed in the conflict between 2003 and 2004, including by U.S. troops, Afghan forces and the Taliban.
Judges argued that a successful prosection was unlikely.
The prosecution has appealed that decision and is arguing the case in three days of hearings before a panel of appeals judges in The Hague.
Lawyer Fergal Gaynor called the hearings ""an historic day for accountability in Afghanistan"". The 82 victims he represented were ""united"" in wanting an investigation, he said.
U.S. forces and other foreign troops intervened in Afghanistan in 2001 following the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States and overthrew the Taliban government, which had been protecting al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. In what has become the United States' longest war, about 13,000 U.S. troops remain there.
More than 32,000 civilians have been killed in the conflict, according to the United Nations.
Later on Wednesday, one of U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyers will address the court.
Counsel Jay Sekulow, who was allowed to file a ""friend of the court"" brief as an independent expert, said in a statement that he intends to defend the interests of members of the U.S. military ""who sacrifice everything to defend us"".
Trump has denounced the ICC, the world's only permanent war crimes court, for its ""broad, unaccountable, prosecutorial powers"". Washington revoked U.S. travel visas for ICC personnel in response to its work on Afghanistan.
Another legal representative of victims, Katherine Gallagher, who acts for two Guantanamo Bay detainees, stressed that so far no high-level U.S. official has been held accountable for alleged violations of the rules of war in Afghanistan or at CIA ""black"" sites.
""The opening of an investigation into the U.S. torture program would make clear that no one is above the law,"" she told judges.
Prosecutors have cited preliminary evidence suggesting that international forces in Afghanistan, including employees of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, mentally and physically abused detainees, which could constitute a war crime.
The ICC, which opened in 2002, has jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity if they have been committed by nationals of a signatory state or if they took place on the territory of one of its members. Afghanistan is a member, the United States is not.
The ICC is also only empowered to act when a country is found to be unable or unwilling to examine misdeeds by its own military and leaders. It has struggled due to opposition from the United States, Russia and China."

He said he had made mistakes in not addressing what he described as personnel issues more swiftly and that he was retiring early voluntarily but would continue to live in Buffalo. 

In September, a poll by the local newspaper, The Buffalo News, showed that about 85 percent of Roman Catholics or lapsed Roman Catholics in the area said he should resign.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Protesters against Chile President Sebastian Pinera's government have rallied around a student blinded by police rubber bullets and his family hopes a photo capturing his injuries will increase international pressure on the administration.
Gustavo Gatica's name is shouted at police, borne on placards and scrawled on walls around the city.
Gatica, 22, was taking pictures of a protest when he was hit on Nov. 8. His case became a lightning rod in Chile for fury directed at police for alleged widespread human rights abuses during more than six weeks of demonstrations over social inequality that have left at least 26 people dead and 13,000 injured, according to prosecutors and human rights organizations. 
He is one of two known cases of people left completely blind but at least 241 Chileans have suffered from eye injuries during the protests, according to Chile's Institute for Human Rights (INDH). 
Pinera has sought to mollify protesters with a spending package and a vote on a new constitution, but the marches continue and spiked last week when doctors confirmed in a statement they had been unable to save Gatica's eyes. 
The interior minister Gonzalo Blumel said last week that the Gatica case was “deeply painful” and made clear police protocols around the use of force needed to be revised. Pinera was not immediately available for comment. 
Police have suspended the use of rubber bullets except in cases of threat to life. 
Mario Rozas, the Chilean police chief, said in an interview with CNN three days after the shooting that he had identified the officers who fired rubber bullets and the force was cooperating with prosecutors. ""I deeply regret what Gustavo suffered,"" he said. 
Police declined to comment further as the case is under investigation, but said they were studying ""profound"" reforms to ensure ""better protection of human rights."" 
Gustavo and his parents declined to be interviewed by Reuters.
Speaking on behalf of the family, Gustavo's brother Enrique Gatica told Reuters in the family’s home town of Colina, 30 km (19 miles) from Santiago, that his brother was still following the protests and willing them on. 
""If fear and repression triumph, if we return to all the indignities we were living with as a society, it would be extremely painful,"" said Enrique, who is studying for a history doctorate and previously worked as an educator at Chile's Villa Grimaldi human rights organization. 

He added that his brother was conscious of the power of his case to effect change. ""If it serves to renew the protests' energy, to ensure change is achieved, he feels it would be worthwhile,"" he said.

Babis, a billionaire businessman, had been investigated on suspicion of illegally tapping 2 million euros in subsidies to build a conference center outside Prague a decade ago, before he entered politics.
He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and rejected calls to resign over the case. There was no immediate reaction from Babis to the state attorney's announcement.
The core of the investigation is allegations that Babis had hidden the ownership of the hotel and conference center Stork Nest so it would qualify for EU funding that was meant only for small businesses.
Supreme State Attorney Pavel Zeman said he disagreed with arguments of the Prague state attorney, who had dropped the case in September, and sent it back for further investigation and a new ruling.
The decision is the second piece of bad news for Babis this week.
Czech media reported that the European Commission had found a conflict of interest on Babis's part as prime minister and as beneficiary of trust funds holding his chemicals, media, food and other assets, which received various EU subsidies. [L8N28E1FE]

Among the sticking points are class sizes and the issue of mandatory online learning, as well as teacher compensation, which the government wants to increase by 1% annually while teachers want increases pegged to inflation.
""Our one-day job action will occur,"" Bischof said in a late Tuesday tweet. He said in a separate statement on Tuesday that after four consecutive days at the table the government advanced not one proposal addressing major issues that affect the quality of education in Ontario.
Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce late on Tuesday urged the union to call off the strike. ""The onus is on OSSTF to be reasonable,"" he said.
""My message to parents on the eve of the potential job action is that our government has remained reasonable at the negotiating table, with the objective of keeping students in class,"" Lecce said in a statement late on Tuesday.
The sides have been negotiating for more than 200 days and strike is estimated to affect around 600,000 students.
Bischof said the one-day strike is aimed at raising public attention on a government that has made cuts and wants to cut deeper.
""And then Thursday we'll be back in schools with our students preparing for the government to moved forward. And if they don't, we'll be prepared to look at additional steps,"" Bischof said.
Last week, Lecce noted the province had changed its offer, reducing classroom sizes, which now average 22.5, from 28 to 25 and reducing the number of mandatory online learning courses from four to two."

The firebrand Philippines leader acted after utility firms Manila Water Co Inc and Maynilad Water Services Inc have won arbitration cases in Singapore against the government.
""A review of the agreements with Manila Water and Maynilad reveals that they are contrary to public policy and public interest, the same being onerous and disadvantageous to the people,"" presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said.
He said Duterte had ordered the filing of criminal, civil and administrative charges against everyone involved in the utility contracts, including the billionaire company owners and public officials for alleged economic sabotage.
Duterte had tasked agencies to draft new utility contracts acceptable to the government, he added in a statement.
In April, Duterte ordered a review of all government contracts with companies and other countries to ensure they were fair to ordinary Filipinos.
Shares in Manila Water dropped 4.8% on Wednesday while Maynilad stockholders Metro Pacific Investments Corp and DMCI Holdings Inc fell 10.7% and 3.9% respectively. Japan's Marubeni Corp owns a minority stake in Maynilad.
The Permanent Court of Arbitration in Singapore this month ordered the Philippine government to pay Manila Water 7.4 billion pesos ($145 million) to recoup foregone revenues from rate increases that were rejected by regulators. Maynilad won a separate arbitration last year.
The two firms argued that the rate hikes were necessary to improve utility service coverage and water pressure in homes.
""The arbitration award issued in our favor is for acts in breach of the procedure committed by officials of the previous administration, not the Duterte administration,"" Manila Water said in a statement, adding that it was willing to cooperate with Duterte's government. Manila Water serves seven million customers through a concession valid until 2037.
Maynilad, which caters to 9 million customers, was not immediately available for comment.
Filipinos are drawn to Duterte's no-nonsense, man-of-the-people style. But his centerpiece policy - a war on drugs - has caused international alarm over what U.N. experts have called a ""staggering"" number of illegal killings by police, who say they shot thousands of drug suspects only in self-defense."

The police gave no details of the charges against Lisa Smith, an Irish citizen who had gone to Turkey from Syria and denies involvement with any terrorist-related activity.
Smith, 38, was due to appear in court later on Wednesday, the police said in a statement.
Ireland agreed to repatriate Smith and her two-year-old daughter after Ankara began deporting foreign citizens linked to Islamic State last month.
Turkey says it has captured 287 militants in northeast Syria, where Turkish troops launched an offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia last month, and has hundreds of jihadist suspects in detention.
Dublin had said for months that it had a responsibility to bring Smith back to Ireland but that police may be in a position to charge her upon her return. She was arrested on Sunday at Dublin airport.
The government's main concern was for the safe repatriation of her daughter, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said. The girl was now being cared for by relatives, police said."

The Kremlin denial came after a legal source on Tuesday said German federal prosecutors believed that Russian intelligence agencies had been linked to the killing.
Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, who had previously fought alongside anti-Moscow separatists in Chechnya, was shot twice in the head in a central Berlin park in August as he was heading to a mosque.
German prosecutors have now taken over the murder case and said they believe there are sufficient leads to suggest that either Russia or the Russian region of Chechnya ordered the hit. 
Asked about allegations of Russian involvement before reports of the diplomatic expulsions broke, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday that Russian authorities had nothing to do with the murder.
“I don’t think there are serious suspicions (of involvement by the Russian authorities) and there cannot be any. What relation to the Russian authorities (does this have)?,"" said Peskov.
""This is absolutely groundless speculation. This topic is being somehow whipped up by German media, but this does not mean that this is how things are,” Peskov said. 
Allegations of Russian involvement could potentially damage Russia's ties with Germany and the West that are already strained over an array of issues including the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in southern Britain last year. 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Paris summit on the conflict in east Ukraine next week.

Some 107 graves were defaced with anti-Semitic inscriptions in the city of Westhoffen, while graffiti against Jews was also found in nearby Schafhouse-sur-Zorn on Tuesday.
France has Europe's biggest Jewish community - around 550,000 - and anti-Semitic attacks are common, with more than 500 alone in 2018.
Earlier this year, politicians from across the spectrum joined marches against anti-Semitism.
They denounced a surge in attacks that some commentators blamed on incitement by Islamist preachers, others on the rise of anti-Zionism - opposition to the existence of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people. 
Lawmakers in parliament's lower house on Tuesday evening approved a non-legally binding resolution modeled on the definition of anti-Semitism set by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).
The IHRA definition, which serves as an international guideline, does not reference ""anti-Zionism"" but does say denying Jews their right to self-determination is anti-Semitic. 
The World Jewish Congress hailed France's step.
""For too long too many have used the excuse that their obsessive criticism of Israel stands exclusive from their otherwise positive feelings for the Jewish people. Those days are now over,"" it said.

Debate over the resolution split Macron's ruling La Republique En Marche party, with some opponents saying it could impede people from criticizing the Israeli government.

Seen by some German media as the power behind the SPD's new leftist leadership whose election has cast doubt over the coalition with Merkel's conservatives, Kevin Kuehnert could sway some members at a crucial party meeting starting on Friday.
""Anyone who leaves a coalition cedes some control,"" Kuehnert told the Rheinische Post newspaper on Wednesday.
He said delegates at the party conference who will debate the future of the coalition should take account of this. ""Not because they should get scared but because decisions must be thought through to the end,"" he added.
Support from the 30-year old hoodie-wearing Berliner and his JUSOS youth wing gave a big boost to the campaign of Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, who won the leadership vote on Saturday and want to renegotiate the coalition deal.
It is unclear how willing the conservatives are to accommodate new SPD demands and if they refuse, Europe's biggest economy may face a snap election or minority government.
Delegates at the conference will vote on what demands to make to Merkel's conservatives to continue the coalition. They include massive investment, more climate protection measures and flexibility on a commitment not to incur new debt.
However, the party's leadership looks like stopping short of pulling the plug on the coalition immediately.
Kuehnert, whose calls last year for the SPD not to agree to join a coalition with Merkel won much support among the party's rank and file, is likely to be put forward as one of the deputy leaders of the party at the conference on Dec. 6-8.
Der Spiegel has described Kuehnert, who triggered a debate in May for saying firms like carmaker BMW should be collectively owned, as the secret leader of the Social Democrats and Bild daily ran a headline saying he was trying to seize power.
""Kuehnert is the Trojan, Borjans the wooden horse,"" Bild quoted one senior SPD member as saying."

WATFORD, England (Reuters) - NATO leaders will tell U.S President Donald Trump on Wednesday they are spending billions more dollars on their militaries in the hope that he pares back his attacks on the Western alliance.
In formal talks following a Buckingham Palace reception on Tuesday to celebrate 70 years of NATO, European leaders led by Germany and France aim to tell Trump they will not be treated as junior partners as they confront global conflicts.
Despite Trump's accusations on Tuesday that allies were ""delinquent"" in their failure to spend as much as the United States on their armed forces, Europe, Turkey and Canada will use the gathering at a luxury golf club north of London to argue they will spend $400 billion collectively on defense by 2024.
""If we invest money and risk our soldiers' lives... we should be clear on NATO's fundamentals,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter, adding that on Wednesday he would ""defend the interests of France and Europe.""
That is likely to include a push to broaden NATO politically to consider a bigger role for the alliance in the Middle East and possibly Africa, although Berlin and Paris must first seek NATO support for a ""wise persons"" group to draw up reform plans.
In a final communique, NATO allies will recommit to their pledge to defend each other, while Britain is also expected to put six warships, two fighter squadrons and thousands of troops at NATO's disposal to meet a U.S. demand for European armies to be more combat-ready.
NATO will also warn China for the first time that it is monitoring Beijing's growing military might, agreeing to gradually prepare the alliance to defend against any possible future hostilities, in arenas ranging from the Arctic to computer networks.
But the debate is unlikely to be easy.
Tuesday's gathering in London was marked by testy exchanges between Trump and Macron over the future of transatlantic ties, while the U.S. leader reiterated his criticism of Germany for not spending enough on defense, seemingly unaware of Berlin's new defense plans to reach a NATO spending target by 2031.
""I'm a politician, and I'm used to being criticized for good rhetoric but bad substance. In the case of NATO it is the opposite. We have had bad rhetoric but extremely good substance,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told diplomats and experts at an event in London on Tuesday.
Macron also accused Turkey of working with Islamic State proxies in Syria, although Canada's leader played down tensions.
""NATO has survived because we've always had frank conversations,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said."

Johnson, who is campaigning before a general election on Dec. 12, had asked Trump not to intervene in the campaign. The British media have suggested Johnson is trying to avoid being seen with Trump, who is unpopular in Britain.

KABUL/NANGARHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Gunmen killed six people, including the head of a Japanese aid agency, on Wednesday in an attack on their vehicle in Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan, officials said.
The ambush comes a week after a grenade attack on a United Nations vehicle in Kabul heightened fears for those doing humanitarian work amid one of the world's longest-running conflicts.
Tetsu Nakamura, head of Peace Japan Medical Services, had been involved in rebuilding Afghan irrigation and agriculture and had recently been granted honorary Afghan citizenship for decades of humanitarian work in the east of the country.
The gunmen fled the scene and police have launched a search operation to arrest them, Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the governing council in the province of Nangarhar told Reuters, adding he believed Nakamura had been targeted for his work.
""Dr. Nakamura has been doing great work in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, especially in irrigation and agriculture,"" he said. 
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban, said the militant group was not involved in the shooting.

The unrest, which began on Nov. 15 after the government abruptly raised fuel prices by as much as 300%, spread to more than 100 cities and towns and turned political as young and working-class protesters demanded clerical leaders step down. 
""Religious and Islamic clemency should be shown and those innocent people who protested against petrol price hikes and were not armed ... should be released,"" Rouhani said in a televised speech. 
Iran's clerical rulers have blamed “thugs” linked to its opponents in exile and the country’s main foreign foes - the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
""The aim of our enemies was to endanger the existence of the Islamic republic by igniting riots in Iran ... But America and the Zionist regime (Israel) lack political wisdom about Iran and Iranians,"" said chief commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Hossein Salami in a televised speech. 
Tehran has given no official death toll, but Amnesty International said on Monday it had documented the deaths of at least 208 protesters, making the disturbances the bloodiest since the 1979 uprising that swept Shi'ite clerics to power.
A lawmaker said last week that about 7,000 protesters had been arrested. The judiciary has rejected the figures. 
The Intelligence Ministry said last week that at least eight people linked to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been arrested during the unrest, which was snuffed out last week by a security crackdown.
The struggle of ordinary Iranians to make ends meet has become harder since last year when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with six world powers and reimposed sanctions that have further crippled Iran's oil-based economy.
""If America lifts the sanctions, we are ready to talk and negotiate, even at the level of heads of the 5+1 countries (major powers),"" Rouhani said. 
In reaction to Washington's ""maximum pressure"", Iran has gradually scaled back its nuclear commitments and has warned of further distancing from the pact if Europeans fail to shield Tehran's economy from U.S. penalties. 

Washington has ruled out lifting sanctions unless Iran further curbs its nuclear work, ends its ballistic missile programme and its regional proxy wars.

The U.S. embassy in Moscow failed to issue visas to a Russian delegation of treasury officials who were due to attend an international audit management conference in Washington on Dec. 3, the Russian embassy in Washington said late on Tuesday.
The U.S. embassy did not immediately respond to the allegations. But it has in the past said its consular section has been understaffed since Moscow ordered it to sharply cut its staff in Russia in 2017 during a major diplomatic row. 
The Russian embassy said it did not believe U.S. visas for Russian citizens were being held up because of a shortage of staff. 
""We are concerned about the U.S. State Department's lack of will to ensure the proper work of its own consular organizations under lame pretexts,"" the Russian embassy said in a statement. 
""Such actions by U.S. authorities are leading to a further degradation of already uneasy relations between the two countries,"" it added.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The top diplomat in China's government arrived in Seoul on Wednesday, visiting South Korea for the first time in more than four years as the countries seek to repair ties that soured over the deployment of U.S. anti-missile systems in South Korea.
During his two-day stay, State Councillor Wang Yi will meet South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and President Moon Jae-in, officials in Seoul said.
Wang last visited the South Korean capital for a trilateral meeting, also attended by Japan, in 2015.
A year later a row blew up over the planned siting in South Korea of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system, designed to intercept ballistic missiles. 
Beijing said it upset the regional security balance as the system's powerful radar could penetrate into Chinese territory. 
South Korea and the United States went ahead regardless, installing the anti-missile system in 2017, saying it was warranted because of North Korea's provocations.
""The ice is melting between the two countries but spring has not yet arrived,"" Renmin University of China associate professor Cheng Xiaohe said in comments carried by the Global Times, an influential tabloid published by the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.
""The toughest time for bilateral relations has passed, but some problems caused by the deployment of the THAAD system in South Korea remain,"" Cheng said.
North Korea has test fired dozens of missiles since Moon Jae-in took office in 2017, most recently on the U.S Thanksgiving holiday last week.
South Korea sees China as instrumental in reviving stalled denuclearization talks between the United States and North Korea, a longtime ally of Beijing.
The agenda for Wang's visit in Seoul is likely to include plans for a trilateral summit with Japan to be held in China later in December, a possible visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea, as well as the stalled denuclearization talks with North Korea, Yonhap news agency reported.
Denuclearization negotiations between North Korea and the United States have hit a stalemate after a day-long working-level meeting in October in Stockholm broke down.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has set an end-year deadline for Washington to reconsider its approach in denuclearization negotiations after the last talks ended in disagreement. U.S. officials have downplayed the deadline, calling it artificial.

South Korea is seeking to open additional military hotlines with China to improve communications. The two countries' defense ministers discussed the issue on the sidelines of an international conference in Bangkok last month, Seoul's defense ministry said.

The government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, prodded officials at a foreign ministry gathering last month to display stronger ""fighting spirit"" in the face of international challenges, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
While Wang did not give explicit direction at the event, the instructions come after several senior Chinese diplomats set up Twitter accounts, some of which have been used to attack Beijing's critics. This week, the foreign ministry also launched a Twitter account.
More than 1,000 current and former officials attended the event in Beijing, singing patriotic songs to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the foreign ministry.
""This is the first time we have been told to show more 'fighting spirit',"" said one source who attended the celebration.
Wang's comments reflect President Xi Jinping's revamp of foreign and military policy, in which he has abandoned the approach laid out by reform architect Deng Xiaoping, who said China should hide its strength and bide its time while it developed.
Xi's wide-ranging policies have included the multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initative and the establishment of the China-controlled Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank.
On Monday, the foreign ministry made its debut on Twitter. One of @MFA_China's inaugural tweets outlined China's response to a new U.S. law on Hong Kong while another took a poke at the case of a man claiming to be a Chinese spy seeking asylum in Australia.
Within a day and a half it had nearly 10,000 followers.
The ministry did not reply immediately to faxed questions about its new Twitter account, the November event or the policy.
RE-SHAPING NARRATIVE
State-run Chinese news outlets have had a presence on overseas social media platforms for years.
And the government has been accused of being involved in other ways - Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said in August they had suspended hundreds of accounts that they said were part of a coordinated state-backed effort by China to undermine protests in Hong Kong. Beijing has defended the right of Chinese people and media to make their voices heard on Hong Kong.
In the last few months, Chinese ambassadors and other senior diplomats have set up at least a dozen Twitter accounts. Twitter has said it considers ""official government voices on Twitter an important element of the service"".
The new accounts reflect efforts by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to attempt to re-shape the global narrative, said Anne-Marie Brady, a Chinese politics specialist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.
""China's international image is a big preoccupation for the CCP leadership,"" she said.
Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times newspaper which is published by the party, said China's pushback, while perhaps appearing defensive at times, was natural.
The West's voices are more numerous and its ""apparatus of public opinion"" more developed than China's, he told Reuters.
""I think this is a problem for China,"" he said.
In the last six months, Chinese ambassadors to Austria, Iran, the Maldives, Mali, Namibia, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Suriname, the United States and the UK have joined Twitter.
Zhao Lijian, a deputy head of the ministry's information department, has been one of the highest profile diplomats on the platform, building on a Twitter following he started when posted to Pakistan until taking his new post in October.
Zhao has regularly needled the United States, with recent tweets thanking America for ""squandering trillions of dollars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria"" and highlighting racism in Washington, DC.
Mike Chinoy, a non-resident senior fellow at the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California's U.S.-China Institute, said he expected China to aggressively make use of social media, perhaps even drawing inspiration from the U.S. president.
""I assume there are diplomats in the foreign ministry and elsewhere in the Chinese bureaucracy who've been watching the extraordinary skill with which Donald Trump used Twitter to shape the political debate in the States and beyond, and so why can't we do that too?"""

Opposition lawmakers allege Abe favored supporters with invites to an annual state-funded cherry blossom viewing party and may have broken campaign laws by subsidizing backers’ attendance at a reception the night before, a scandal that has eaten away at support for his administration.
Questions have also arisen over why this year's guest list was shredded the same day opposition lawmakers asked for it. Abe has denied wrongdoing, saying the timing was a coincidence and revealing the names of guests would infringe on their privacy.
Under questioning in parliament on Tuesday, Abe repeated this explanation, adding the shredding took place when it did ""because of the work schedule of the disabled contractor in charge"".
Abe's comment set off a social media firestorm and was one of the top trending topics on Japanese Twitter on Wednesday.
""Hey, doesn't this comment reveal personal information? Even though it doesn't give a name?"" wrote user Tonas Reigetsuin.
Others slammed Abe for using the disabled worker as a shield. ""He's the worst, he could have just referred to the worker's schedule - why did he have to insert the word disabled?"" one added.
Asked why Abe had mentioned that the worker was disabled, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference it was in response to repeated questions in parliament about the timing of the shredding.
""There was a need to make sure there was enough time to work easily,"" he added, without giving further details.
Some people said the comments were emblematic of attitudes in Japan, where just a year ago the government was found to have inflated the number of disabled employees they had and three years ago a man stabbed 19 disabled people to death in their beds, saying they had no right to live.
""Saying that a disabled person did it implies it couldn't be helped, it happened because they were disabled,"" wrote a Twitter user by the name of Mia Doi.
""This comment is bigoted and looks down on people. It also shows the prime minister thinks the disabled are people who make mistakes."""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian unions and student groups plan a third national strike on Wednesday amid fraught talks between protest leaders and the government over President Ivan Duque's social and economic policies.
The strike would be the latest demonstration in two weeks of protests, which have drawn hundreds of thousands of marchers and imperiled Duque's proposed tax reform, which lowers duties on businesses.
The protests prompted him to announce a ""great national dialogue"" on social issues, but government efforts to stop new demonstrations have not met with success as the union-led National Strike Committee has stuck firmly to demands for one-on-one talks and refused to call off the protests.
The demonstrations, while largely peaceful, resulted in damage to dozens of public transport stations and curfews in the cities of Cali and Bogota.
Protesters have wide-ranging demands - that the government to do more to stop the murder of human rights activists, more support for former leftist rebels who demobilized under a peace deal and the dissolutiion of the ESMAD riot police, whom marchers have accused of excessive force.
Five people have died in connection with the demonstrations, which started on Nov. 21 and have occurred in tandem with protests in other Latin American countries.
The Central Union of Workers, the country's largest union, said it would negotiation this week with the government even as protests continue.
Protesters in Bogota, the capital, are to march from seven locations across the city on Wednesday before converging on the central Bolivar Plaza, in front of congress and a block from the presidential palace.
The city's mayor has closed the plaza, long a popular protest site, to put up annual Christmas decorations and has asked protesters not to gather there.
The strike committee has made 13 demands of the government, including that it reject a rise in the pension age and a cut in the minimum wage for young people, both policies Duque denies supporting.
The government has repeatedly said the committee's demands for dialogue exclude other sectors and that it cannot meet certain demands, including that it refrain from deploying the ESMAD.
The government and the committee are expected to meet again on Thursday."

""Police located the body, which is believed to be that Claire Hockridge during search efforts,"" Northern Territory police said in an emailed statement.
Hockridge has been missing since she went hiking with two friends two weeks ago.
One of them, Phu Tran, 40, was found on Tuesday by a local farmer at a cattle station near Alice Springs. He said he survived soaring temperatures by drinking water meant for livestock. 
Tran was found three days after his friend Tamra McBeath-Riley was found about 1.5 km (0.9 miles) from the car they had been traveling in through Australia's remote north.
McBeath-Riley said the car became bogged down in the soft desert roads in the region. 
For a few days, the group stayed close to the car, surviving on the limited supplies they had packed, McBeath-Riley said. 
After running out of water, Phu Tran and Hockridge went looking for help, taking only a compass and a GPS.

Police had originally hoped that Hockridge would be found alive after she and Phu Tran found water, though the pair separated some time before he was found.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Kim Jong Un mounted a white horse again as North Korea announced on Wednesday it will soon convene a rare meeting of the ruling party's leaders, steps analysts say may signal preparations for a more confrontational stance with the international community.
For the second time in two months, Kim visited North Korea's sacred Mt Paektu on horseback, this time accompanied by senior military officers, aimed at instilling a ""revolutionary spirit"" in the people, state news agency KCNA reported. 
Kim has warned the United States it has until the end of the year to offer more concessions to restart stalled denuclearization talks or North Korea will pursue an unspecified ""new path"". Analysts believe that may include a resumption of intercontinental ballistic missile launches or nuclear tests.
The United States has called for North Korea to give up significant portions of its nuclear arsenal before punishing international sanctions are eased, while Pyongyang has accused the United States of ""gangster-like"" demands for unilateral disarmament.
Speaking in Washington on Tuesday, U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun said the United States would not give up on talks with Pyongyang.
Biegun has previously downplayed the year-end deadline, calling it ""artificial"" and warning that it would be a ""huge mistake and a missed opportunity"" for North Korea to take any provocative steps.
But North Korean state media have carried a steady chorus of statements in recent weeks, saying Washington should not ignore the warning and dismissing U.S. calls for talks as a stalling tactic.
The announcement that a Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea would meet sometime in late December underscores how North Korea is serious about making a major decision, analysts said.
Such meetings have often been when North Korea has announced major policy shifts.
KCNA said the plenum would discuss and decide on ""crucial issues"" in light of the ""changed situation at home and abroad"".
The timing of this plenum is unusual because it comes before the year-end deadline, as well as before Kim's expected New Year's address, said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with NK News, a website that monitors North Korea. 
""That Pyongyang is opting to hold this meeting before the end of the year indicates its strong resolve,"" she said. ""Taking the party plenum announcement and the Mount Paektu visit together, the 'resolve' seems to be that North Korea will not cave in to the U.S., and that it will keep charging on despite the difficulties.""
'PREPARE FOR HARSHNESS'
KCNA reported Kim was joined by top military aides as he rode a white horse in a tour of historic battlefields near Mount Paektu.
Kim has often visited the sacred mountain around the time of major developments in North Korea, including missile launches, and his horseback visit in October sparked speculation of a change in North Korea's nuclear negotiation strategy.
State media photos on Wednesday showed the saddle and harness on Kim's horse adorned with more intricate gold-colored fittings and government emblems.
The ride was aimed at instilling in North Koreans the mountain's ""indefatigable revolutionary spirit"" in the face of ""unprecedented blockade and pressure imposed by the imperialists,"" KCNA reported.
Kim said there was a need to prepare for ""the harshness and protracted character of our revolution,"" according to KCNA.
While Kim's plans are still unclear, the signals suggest the window for diplomacy is closing fast, if not already shut, said John Delury of Seoul's Yonsei University.
""The message is buckle up, it’s going to be a big year for us next year,"" he said. ""And not a year of diplomacy and summitry, but rather of national strength.""
The ride is full of symbolism for North Koreans and sending strident messages to domestic audiences more fully commits Kim to following through on his declarations, Delury said.
Lee noted the fact Kim was accompanied by senior army officers rather than party officials, combined with other recent military-related announcements by state media, suggests North Korea ""will likely transition to a more militaristic line"".
The plenum meeting would mark the first time such a gathering has occurred twice in one year under Kim Jong Un, Delury said.

""This is not a standard meeting,"" he said. ""How many details will actually come out of that meeting is anyone's guess. But it signals that diplomacy could be off and they are really going to act on this.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad formally launched on Wednesday preparations to host next year's APEC summit, recalling with pride how his country hosted the event more than 20 years ago, but also flagging risks.
The 94-year-old, who unexpectedly won a general election last year, has said he will stay on as prime minister to see through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit before possibly handing the baton to a coalition colleague. He will be the first world leader to host the event twice.
""We believe it is quite fitting for Malaysia to kick-start our second opportunity to host APEC at the same place as we did just over two decades ago,"" Mahathir said at the launch ceremony in Cyberjaya, which houses many information technology companies on the edge of the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
A key goal of next year's summit is to finalize the 21-member forum's post-2020 vision. The first informal meetings of APEC senior officials will be held on the Malaysian island of Langkawi next week.
Mahathir recalled that his country last hosted APEC a year after the Asian financial crisis of 1997, when investors lost confidence in the so-called ""Tiger economies"" of Southeast Asia and currency markets in the region were hammered. (Read story https://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-crises-history/factbox-financial-crises-in-last-40-years-idUSTRE4AD6D520081114)
""Today, Malaysia will launch APEC 2020 against almost a similar backdrop, when downside risks are continuing to build up and trade policy tensions are still with us,"" he said. ""All these trends will continue to weaken investors' confidence, leading to the diminishing trust in the benefits of global trade and investment to the everyday people.""
Mahathir also said most participating countries had turned down the idea of the United States' co-hosting another APEC summit early next year, in place of the one for 2019 that host Chile canceled because of street protests.
""There was an invitation extended to APEC countries, but almost every one of us decided it was not necessary,"" Mahathir told reporters after the launch event.
APEC, founded in 1989 with a view to fostering trade and economic ties around the Pacific Ocean, operated at a ministerial level until 1993 when U.S. President Bill Clinton established the annual leaders' meeting."
1074,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 11:09PM ET</span>",Australia restricts medical evacuations of refugees from Pacific camps,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Wednesday removed the right of doctors to order sick asylum seekers be evacuated from two remote Pacific detention centers for medical treatment, a repeal that opponents said risks the lives of refugees.
Under Australia's controversial immigration policy, asylum seekers intercepted at sea are sent to camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. They can never settle in Australia, even if they are found to be refugees.
In February, independent lawmakers and the opposition joined forces to give doctors the right to order sick asylum seekers be sent to Australia if they required medical care.
After securing re-election in May, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government would seek to repeal the legislation, though he needed the support of independent lawmakers as the coalition does not enjoy a majority in Australia's upper house Senate.
After weeks of negotiations, the repeal legislation passed Australia's Senate by 37 votes to 35.
""You can take advice from doctors, but doctors aren't elected. They aren't accountable to the public,"" independent lawmaker Jacqui Lambie, who cast the decisive vote, told the Senate.
Around 500 people remain on the two island centers, many suffering mental health issues after more than six years in detention, aid organizations say.
The United Nations has repeatedly criticized Australia's remote detention centers, insisting they lack adequate medical and mental health care.
""To now deny medical professionals from taking decisions in patients’ best interests – and to effectively hand that power back to unqualified officials... puts those most sick and vulnerable at risk,"" Paul McPhun, Executive Director of Médecins Sans Frontières Australia said in a statement.
Morrison rejected those allegations, insisting Canberra has provided significant medical aid, while those unable to get necessary treatment can be sent to Australia if the minister for home affairs approves it. 
As a result, Morrison said the medical evacuation legislation is unnecessary and undermines Canberra's border policy, designed to discourage asylum seekers from undertaking dangerous sea voyages to Australia. 
In 2016, Australia agreed a deal with former U.S. President Barack Obama to offer refuge to up to 1,250 asylum seekers. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump said it would only honor that deal to maintain a strong relationship with Australia, and then only on condition that refugees satisfied strict checks.
Around 650 refugees have been resettled in the United States, with a further 250 in PNG and Nauru approved to go at a future date, Peter Dutton, the Minister for Home Affairs told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. 
Australia has rejected offers from neighboring New Zealand to take a further 150 asylum seekers, fearing refugees will use it as a 'backdoor entry' into Australia.

Media reported Lambie has sought a commitment that Canberra will now accept Wellington's offer. Morrison and Lambie declined to comment.

Following the dramatic saga - where riot police and more than 1,000 demonstrators transformed Hong Kong's Polytechnic University campus into a battleground - officers were called to retrieve additional dangerous items found among the debris and stowed in locked areas.
Between Nov. 26 and Dec. 2 authorities seized 4,296 petrol bombs, 671 bottles of chemicals and 622 weapons, police said in a statement late on Tuesday.
Officers first entered the Polytechnic campus on Nov. 29, when they collected thousands of petrol bombs, which they dusted for fingerprints, as well as bows and arrows and bottles of chemicals.
The campus conflict began in mid-November when protesters barricaded themselves against riot police in days of violent clashes that marked a significant escalation in the political unrest that has roiled the former British colony for six months.
About 1,100 people were arrested in connection with the campus siege.
Sparked by a controversial and since-withdrawn extradition bill, the protests have swelled into broader calls for greater democratic freedoms.
Those who have joined the pro-democracy demonstrations accuse China of increasingly interfering in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Pro-democracy parties won a resounding victory in local district council elections late last month. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has appealed for peace in the city but has not offered any concessions.
Sustained demonstrations, scheduled to continue this week and expected to draw thousands to the streets this weekend, show few signs of abating and are taking an economic toll on the global financial hub.
Business activity in Hong Kong contracted at the fastest pace in 21 years in November, dragged down by the protests and softening global demand, an IHS Markit survey showed on Wednesday.
Asia's largest distributor of luxury brands, the Blubell group, has appealed to Hong Kong landlords to scrap the base rent in shopping malls, saying a slump in tourist spending will push even more retailers out of business.
Sales in some of its stores, two of which are on the verge of closing, have dropped as much as 60 percent during the six months of protests, Bluebell chief executive Ashley Micklewright told the South China Morning Post.
Hong Kong recorded its largest-ever retail collapse in October, with sales dropping 24.3 percent to HK$30.1 billion, the government said Monday.
The new figures will extend the technical recession recorded last quarter, with the government preparing to release a fourth round of economic stimulus."

Typhoon Kammuri, the 20th to enter the Philippines this year, hit land on Monday night, prompting forced evacuation of thousands of residents and cancellation of hundreds of flights. It also disrupted the schedule for some events in the Southeast Asian Games, which the Philippines is hosting until Dec. 11.
Five people died in the central Bicol region, including three who drowned, a local disaster agency said in a report. Five more were killed in a region south of the capital.
Around 345,000 people are still in evacuation centers, awaiting authorities' clearance for them to return home, disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal told broadcaster ANC.
""The storm left the usual damage of major storms such as fallen trees, ruined roofs of houses and some government facilities,"" Timbal said. Officials said forced evacuations and preparations prevented greater loss of life.
Sustained winds of Kammuri weakened to 100 kilometers per hour (67 miles per hour), with gusts of up to 125 kph (78 mph) as it heads toward the South China Sea. It is set to leave the Philippines on Wednesday night, the state weather bureau said.

Pompeo, accompanying President Donald Trump at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in London, will be in Lisbon on Wednesday and Thursday and will meet with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa and Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva, the department said in a statement. It did not say which day Netanyahu and Pompeo would meet.
The hastily arranged talks with the top diplomat of Israel's closest ally could be aimed at giving Netanyahu a political boost at home.
Israeli politics are in disarray after inconclusive elections in April and September and the failure of Netanyahu and his main challenger, Benny Gantz, to secure a ruling majority in the legislature. Netanyahu also faces a corruption indictment, charges that he denies.
Pompeo and Netanyahu are expected to speak about the threat from Iran, among the issues the Israeli leader discussed in a phone call on Sunday.
Netanyahu praised Pompeo last month for an announcement of a softening of the longtime U.S. position on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Pompeo declared that Washington no longer considered the Jewish settlements to be in violation of international law, a policy shift that drew condemnation from Palestinians and Arab leaders.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Fifteen countries in the Americas agreed on Tuesday to ban 29 Venezuelans, including the oil-producing country's president, Nicolas Maduro, and his close allies, from traveling within their borders as part of diplomatic efforts to push him to step down.
The meeting included representatives from Argentina, Brazil, the United States, Colombia, Chile and Peru, all signatories of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TIAR), an accord that promises mutual defense among members of the Organization of American States (OAS).
The group in September approved the identification, sanctioning and extradition of leading members of Venezuela's government who it said were linked with activities related to money laundering, drug trafficking and terrorism.
The list of people banned on Tuesday from traveling to the 15 TIAR countries also included top Maduro allies such as Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez and Diosdado Cabello, the No. 2 of the ruling Socialist Party.
Cabello dismissed the measures by the TIAR countries.
""I reject the imperialist attempt and the attempts of these North American allies to come and involve themselves in Venezuela's internal matters. Venezuela demands respect,"" Cabello said, following a march against the meeting in Caracas.
Some 500 people linked to Maduro have already been targeted by various sanctions, said Julio Borges, who attended the meeting as a representative of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who argues Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate. Guaido this year invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency. Most Western countries have backed him as head of state.
Maduro has said Guaido is a puppet of the United States.
The countries at Tuesday's meeting discussed new measures to support a re-establishment of democracy and respect for human rights in Venezuela, said Colombia's foreign minister, Claudia Blum, as part of a strategy to stem migration flowing from the country.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - One of U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyers will speak to the International Criminal Court on Wednesday to block efforts by the chief prosecutor to open a war crimes investigation that would scrutinize the actions of American forces overseas.
ICC judges in April rejected the request of prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to examine atrocities alleged to have been committed in the conflict between 2003 and 2004, including by U.S. troops, Afghan forces and the Taliban.
Bensouda will reassert her case to open a formal inquiry during three days of hearings before a panel of appeals judges in The Hague.
Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, who was allowed to file a ""friend of the court"" brief as an independent expert, said in a statement ahead of the session that he intends to defend the interests of members of the U.S. military ""who sacrifice everything to defend us.""
""Our troops face an insidious new threat, as the International Criminal Court’s Prosecutor is seeking jurisdiction to prosecute our soldiers on war crimes charges after they’ve risked their lives fighting the war on terror,"" he said.
Sekulow has been given a 10-minute slot to clarify in court written arguments which the judges already received. The U.S. government has not asked to present its views separately.
Trump has denounced the ICC, the world's only permanent war crimes court, for its ""broad, unaccountable, prosecutorial powers"". Washington revoked travel visas for ICC personnel in response to its work on Afghanistan.
The appeal of the April ruling is supported by human rights groups and legal experts who criticized the judges' finding that an investigation was not in the ""interest of justice"" because Afghanistan and the United States were unlikely to cooperate.
Several of those groups, as well as the Afghan government and victims, are also scheduled to speak to the ICC panel.
Prosecutors have cited preliminary evidence suggesting that international forces in Afghanistan, including employees of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, mentally and physically abused detainees, which could constitute a war crime.
The ICC, which opened in 2002, has jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity if they have been committed by nationals of a signatory state or if they took place on the territory of one of its 123 members, who include Afghanistan.
The ICC is a court of last resort for the most serious crimes in conflict, stepping in only when a country is found to be unable or unwilling to investigate itself.
The ICC has struggled to be successful without the support of superpowers the United States, Russia and China, which can veto referrals to the court by the U.N. Security Council."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - In a highly unusual move, the Vatican has postponed the beatification of the late Archbishop Fulton Sheen, a charismatic figure of U.S. Roman Catholicism in the 20th century and pioneer in religious media.
Sheen, who died in 1979 and was sometimes called the first ""televangelist,"" was to have been beatified at a ceremony led by a Vatican cardinal in Peoria, Illinois on Dec. 21.
But the bishop of that diocese, Daniel Jenky, announced on Tuesday it would be postponed and that no new date had been chosen.
Jenky said in a statement that the Vatican postponed the beatification, which would have put Sheen one step closer to sainthood, after ""a few"" American bishops had ""asked for further consideration"".
The statement gave no further explanation but said ""there has never been, nor is there now, any allegation against Sheen involving the abuse of a minor"". The Catholic Church's reputation has been damaged by sexual abuse of minors and cover-ups.
The delay of a beatification ceremony just weeks before it was to have taken place is believed to be unprecedented in living memory.
Pope Francis approved the beatification in July with a decree recognizing a miracle attributed to Sheen's intercession with God.
One miracle must be attributed to a candidate for sainthood before beatification. A second miracle must be ascertained after beatification in order for sainthood to be conferred.
The Church teaches that only God performs miracles but that saints who are believed to be with God in heaven intercede on behalf of people who pray to them. A miracle is usually the medically inexplicable healing of a person.
""The Catholic Hour,"" which Sheen hosted between 1930 and 1950 on the NBC radio network, had an audience of four million.
Sheen moved to television with ""Life is Worth Living"" which had a prime time audience of 30 million people and did so well it challenged the rating of shows hosted by Frank Sinatra and other stars. The show ended in 1957. He returned to television in 1961 with The Fulton Sheen Program, which aired until 1968.
A theologian and author of some 80 books, Sheen used those shows not only to preach Christianity and bolster the U.S. Church but also to condemn Adolf Hitler during World War Two and Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in the early years of the Cold War."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Tuesday accused a former U.S. Marine it has held for almost a year on spying charges of faking health problems in custody and lying about his ill-treatment, comments the U.S. embassy rejected as factually inaccurate ""pulp fiction"".
Paul Whelan, who holds U.S., British, Canadian and Irish passports, was accused of espionage after agents from Russia's Federal Security Service detained him in a Moscow hotel room on Dec. 28. Whelan, who is being held in pre-trial detention, denies Moscow's allegations and says he was set up in a political sting.
He has alleged at court hearings that he is being subjected to ill treatment in custody and that his complaints are systematically ignored. In October, he said a prison guard had forced him to his knees and threatened him with a gun.
In August, Whelan's lawyer said his client was suffering from a groin hernia that prison authorities were aggravating, prompting the U.S. embassy to demand immediate access to Whelan.
A U.S. diplomat met him last week in jail and called for his immediate release. The U.S. embassy described Whelan's treatment as ""shameful"" and said Moscow had refused permission for an outside doctor to examine him.
On Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Whelan's allegations of ill-treatment had not checked out and that diplomats were being granted regular access to him in custody. 
""They (the diplomats) know perfectly well that the public statements by the accused about certain abuses and even threats (made to his) life in pre-trial detention - are nothing more than the defense's provocatory line to help artificially create noise around his person,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
It said Whelan had received qualified medical treatment from the detention facility's doctors as well as a special clinic and that they had not found him to have any serious ailment. 
""So there is no threat to Whelan's health, and the pretending which he is periodically resorting to is apparently part of the training for U.S. intelligence officers,"" the ministry said.
The U.S. embassy in Moscow rejected the statement on social media, saying Whelan's health was deteriorating, that he needed an independent medical examination to assess his condition and that Moscow had presented no evidence of his guilt. 

""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should stop distorting the facts. #PaulWhelan is not a spy. Still no evidence. Still no calls to his family. Enough is enough. Let Paul go home,"" the embassy wrote on Twitter.

The move paves the way for players under contract with Major League Baseball (MLB) teams or their minor league affiliates to participate in the Venezuelan league, known as the LVBP. MLB had previously barred its players from taking part, pending U.S. government authorization.
Washington in August blocked most U.S. individuals and companies from doing business with Venezuela's government as part of its effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse in the once-prosperous OPEC nation and is accused of corruption and rights violations.
The measures have been unsuccessful in ousting Maduro, and critics say they have affected the daily lives of ordinary Venezuelans without links to the government. 
In a copy of the license to sanctions, dated Dec. 2, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control said it would authorize transactions ""ordinarily incident and necessary to participation in the League"" that would otherwise have been blocked by the sanctions through Nov. 30, 2021. 
A Treasury spokeswoman said the department does not generally comment on individual licenses. The MLB and LVBP did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The LVBP's season got off to an underwhelming start last month, with stadiums nearly empty and star players absent from the eight teams' rosters due to MLB's ban on participation by major and minor league teams.
In the license, the Treasury said it would not authorize participation in two of the league's six teams: the Tigres de Aragua from the city of Maracay and the Navegantes de Magallanes, from the city of Valencia. 
Representatives from the two teams deferred comment to the LVBP.

""If the organization puts itself on one of the extremes, it stops being effective at solving problems, it stops being present in the solution and it becomes part of the problem,"" said de Zela. ""That cannot happen.""
Venezuela's economic and political crisis - which has led to widespread shortages of food and medicine and an exodus of people - has dominated recent OAS meetings, with some member states denouncing President Nicolas Maduro as a dictator, while others back him.
Member states have also tussled over the admittance to meetings of a representative sent by Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaido, who argues Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate. Guaido this year invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency.
Almagro, a Uruguayan whose re-election bid is backed by the United States, Colombia and Brazil, has sought to ramp up pressure on Maduro, including refusing to rule out the use of force against his government last year. 
""It's evident that in Venezuela, there is an interruption of the democratic process, it's evident that the Maduro regime lacks legitimacy, that's not under discussion. But at the same time, to actively promote the use of force to solve the case of Venezuela is unreal and doesn't help,"" said de Zela.
""That is putting ourselves on an extreme. Talking constantly about the use of force to solve the issue of Venezuela is not an effective contribution or a realistic contribution.""
Venezuelans must solve their own problems through dialogue, de Zela added, saying free and fair elections must be held urgently in the oil-producing country.
""The OAS is not having, as it once did, an active role in cooperation to solve these things,"" de Zela said. ""There is a lack of dialogue between the member countries and the general secretariat.""

Alejandro Sinibaldi, former minister of communications, infrastructure and housing, was targeted under an act that allows the U.S. State Department to impose sanctions on foreign government officials involved in corruption.
The measures bar him, his wife and children from traveling to the United States.
Sinibaldi was found by U.N.-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala to have run a scheme of money laundering. He served under former President Otto Perez Molina, who fell from power in 2015 following an investigation into his alleged involvement in a multibillion-dollar graft scheme.
""Today's action reaffirms U.S. commitment to combating corruption in Guatemala and around the globe, and it sends a strong signal to other persons involved in significant corruption that they will not receive safe harbor in the United States,"" said Pompeo, who called Sinibaldi a ""fugitive from justice."""

Six vessels belonging to state-run oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, were targeted, according to a statement from the U.S. Treasury Department. 
""Cuba and the former Maduro regime continue trying to circumvent sanctions by changing the names of vessels and facilitating the movement of oil from Venezuela to Cuba,"" said Treasury Deputy Secretary Justin Muzinich. 
""The United States will continue to take necessary action to protect the people of Venezuela,"" he added.
The Treasury Department also identified a vessel named Esperanza as property of blacklisted Caroil Transport Marine Ltd and said it was previously designated under the name Nedas.
The United States and more than 50 other countries have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate president. Guaido invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency in January, arguing Maduro’s 2018 re-election was a sham.
But Maduro retains the support of the military, runs the government’s day-to-day operations and is backed by Russia, China and Cuba.
""Cuba continues to prop up Nicolas Maduro, subverting the Venezuelan people’s right to self-determination and undermining Venezuelan institutions,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on the latest sanctions.
Pompeo said Caracas ships oil to Cuba in exchange for security and intelligence assistance from Havana that supports Maduro.
Under the latest sanctions, Americans are prohibited from engaging in transactions that involve the blacklisted vessels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of girls and young women began as early as 1985 and targeted victims as young as 13 years old, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by nine accusers against his estate.
The accusers, known as Jane Doe I through Jane Doe IX, are among more than 20 women so far to formally seek compensation from Epstein's $577 million estate, after he killed himself on Aug. 10 in a Manhattan jail cell.
Epstein's death at age 66 was ruled a suicide, and came five weeks after his arrest on federal charges he trafficked dozens of underage girls from at least 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty. Many accusers have said his abuses occurred last decade.
Lawyers for Epstein's estate did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in a New York state court in Manhattan.
The nine women said Epstein's abuses spanned more than two decades, often with help from associates, and six said they were raped.
One accuser, Jane Doe II, said Epstein sexually assaulted, abused and battered her starting around 1985, when she was 23.
Another accuser, Jane Doe I, said she was 14 when abuse began around 1990, while Jane Doe III said she was just 13 when her abuse began around 2003.
Jordan Merson, a lawyer for the nine women, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Nov. 14, the executors of Epstein's estate, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, asked a judge in the U.S. Virgin Islands to establish a voluntary restitution fund to compensate Epstein's victims.
The fund's administrators would include Kenneth Feinberg, who has overseen payments on claims tied to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the  BP  (LON:BP) oil spill in 2010, and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) vehicles with defective ignition switches.
Epstein had originally escaped federal prosecution by pleading guilty in 2008 in a Florida state prostitution case. That plea is now widely considered too lenient."

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and French leader Emmanuel Macron clashed over the future of NATO on Tuesday before a summit intended to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Western military alliance.
In sharp exchanges underlining discord in a transatlantic bloc hailed by backers as the most successful military pact in history, Trump demanded that Europe pay more for its collective defense and make concessions to U.S. interests on trade.
Macron, the French president, stood by comments he made last month describing NATO as suffering from a lack of strategic purpose akin to ""brain death"", and criticized fellow NATO member Turkey, which he accused of working with Islamic State proxies.
Washington and Paris have long argued over NATO's purpose - France opposed the 2003 Iraq war - but the new tensions will add to doubts over the alliance's future that have grown with Trump's ambivalence over U.S. commitments to defend Europe.
Trump said Macron's criticism of NATO was ""very, very nasty"" and questioned whether the U.S. military should defend any countries that were ""delinquent"" on alliance targets for national military spending.
""It's not right to be taken advantage of on NATO and also then to be taken advantage of on trade, and that's what happens. We can't let that happen,"" Trump said of transatlantic disputes on issues ranging from the aerospace sector to a European digital services tax on U.S. technology giants.
All 29 member states have a target of spending 2% of their gross domestic product on defense and Trump has singled out Germany for falling short of that goal.
But Macron stood by his criticism of NATO and said its real problem was a failure to forge a clear purpose since the end of the Cold War.
""If we invest money and put our soldiers' lives at risk in theaters of operation we must be clear about the fundamentals of NATO,"" he said in a tweet at the end of a day overshadowed by tensions between the French and U.S. leaders. 
A French presidency official said Trump often makes strident statements ahead of bilateral meetings and cools his rhetoric later. He noted that Macron and Trump ""exchanged jokes and were very relaxed"" at a joint news conference in London.
COLLECTIVE DEFENSE AT STAKE
Turkey threatened to block a plan to defend Baltic states and Poland against Russian attacks unless NATO backed Ankara in recognizing the Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists.
The YPG's fighters have long been U.S. and French allies against Islamic State in Syria. Turkey considers them an enemy because of links to Kurdish insurgents in southeastern Turkey.
""If our friends at NATO do not recognize as terrorist organizations those we consider terrorist organizations ... we will stand against any step that will be taken there,"" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said before traveling to London.
Erdogan has already strained alliance ties with a move to buy Russian air defense systems. Trump said he was looking at imposing sanctions on Ankara over the issue.
The uncertainty over the plan for Poland and the Baltic states, drawn up at their request after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, raises issues about security on all of NATO's frontiers.
Under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 1949 founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all its members, and the alliance has military strategies for collective defense across its territory.
The summit, in a hotel in Hertfordshire just outside London, begins on Wednesday. 
On Tuesday evening, alliance leaders attended a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace.
The British monarch, in a teal-colored matching jacket and skirt, greeted the summiteers and accompanying partners, including former fashion model Melania Trump, who was wearing a bright yellow dress with matching cape and purple sleeves.
They were then welcomed to 10 Downing Street by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, host of the summit a little over a week before the country faces an election.
Several hundred protesters gathered in London's Trafalgar Square (NYSE:SQ), holding placards reading: ""Dump Trump"" and ""No to racism, no to Trump"". A police line divided them from a small group of Trump supporters wearing Make America Great Again caps, waving American flags and shouting: ""Build the wall"".
In Washington on Tuesday, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives laid out their impeachment case against Trump, accusing him of using the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.
Hoping to placate Trump, Europe, Turkey and Canada will pledge at the summit some $400 billion in defense spending by 2024, and agree to a reduction of the U.S. contribution to fund the alliance itself.
The allies will approve a new strategy to monitor China's growing military activity, and identify space as a domain of warfare, alongside air, land, sea and computer networks.

Trump said he believed Russia wanted deals on arms control and nuclear issues, and that he would be willing to bring China into such accords.

The conservative Social Liberal Party (PSL) suspended Eduardo Bolsonaro for one year for trying to oust its founder Luciano Bivar last month in a battle for control of the party that led to President Bolsonaro leaving to start his own party.
The split has left the far-right president without a formal base in Congress for which to push through his agenda of bills aimed at reducing the size of government, fighting graft, loosening gun laws and asserting Christian family values.
The small PSL party surged from nowhere to become the second largest in Brazil's Congress by serving as the platform for Bolsonaro’s successful presidential run last year riding on a wave of conservative sentiment in the country.
The party said it punished 18 members for siding with the Bolsonaros in a bitter struggle for control of the party and its large election campaign war chest lost by the president.
The PSL will seek to have Eduardo Bolsonaro removed as chairman of the foreign relations committee arguing that the position was assigned to the party according to its number of seats."

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Talks between the Colombian government and the unions and student organizations that are planning major protests this week ended without advances on Tuesday, as the country prepares for its third national strike since late November. 
Hundreds of thousands of Colombians have participated in protests against President Ivan Duque's social and economic policies since Nov. 21, imperiling the government's tax reform proposal and leading Duque to announce a ""great national dialogue.""
Five people have died in connection with the demonstrations, including a young man killed by homemade explosives on Monday in the city of Medellin during a protest at a public university.
On Monday the government asked the unions and student groups that make up the National Strike Committee to call off the Wednesday protest and agreed to a parallel dialogue with them.
The committee rejected the request to halt the strike, continuing to demand the government meet only with them instead of including business groups and others in talks.
Diogenes Orjuela, the head of the Central Union of Workers (CUT), told Reuters early on Tuesday the strike would go ahead and that his organization would continue to seek dialogue without ""conditions on our plan of action which we have through December 10.""
The CUT is the country's main union, with more than 500,000 members.
The committee has made 13 demands of the government, including that it reject a rise in the pension age and a cut in the minimum wage for young people, both policies Duque denies ever supporting.
A meeting between the committee and the government ended without progress on Tuesday, with presidency official Diego Molano telling journalists that certain committee demands could not be met. 
""What they have requested can't be fulfilled, particularly if we only maintain the exclusive and independent negotiations,"" Molano said, adding the committee's demand that the ESMAD riot police not be present during demonstrations was also inviable.
The death last week of 18-year-old protestor Dilan Cruz has helped fuel anger at the ESMAD, protesters accuse of using excessive force during crowd dispersion efforts. Cruz was fatally injured on the third day of protests by an ESMAD projectile.
Orjuela told journalists following Tuesday's meeting that the negotiations will move forward while protests continue.

In November last year, Germany imposed a ban on future arms sales to Saudi Arabia and temporarily halted deliveries of previously approved kit after Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in Riyadh's diplomatic mission in Istanbul.
But the court ruled that authorities had failed to follow proper procedures in revoking a previously issued license allowing the sale of 110 vehicles to Saudi Arabia, 10 of which had already been sent by the end of last October.
A legal source said the company in question was Rheinmetall.
The court said the manner in which the export license had been revoked indicated that authorities were trying to avoid being forced to pay compensation.

CARACAS/MARACAIBO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido's faltering efforts to oust President Nicolas Maduro are facing a new challenge in the form of an influence-peddling scandal that has left disillusioned Venezuelans wondering if Guaido's moment has passed.
Guaido on Sunday said the opposition-controlled congress would investigate alleged wrongdoing within its ranks after website Armando.info reported that nine opposition lawmakers had advocated for a businessman linked to Maduro's government.
To a dozen Venezuelans interviewed by Reuters around the country, the scandal has marked another blow to Guaido's reputation and to their hopes of seeing the back of the deeply unpopular Maduro, who has presided over a five-year economic crisis and an expanding authoritarian state.
For Mario Silva, an engineer waiting by a bus stop in the crumbling western city of Maracaibo, it was time to move on. ""Guaido missed his moment,"" the 60-year-old said.
When Guaido declared an interim presidency in January in a bold challenge to Maduro, Silva joined millions of Venezuelans in celebrating the arrival of a fresh-faced politician who had united the oft-fractured opposition and was untainted by its previous scandals.
Silva had backed the ""socialist revolution"" led by the late Hugo Chavez and for a while supported his successor, Maduro, until, he said, Venezuela's worsening poverty and widespread corruption became too obvious to ignore.
""I saw Guaido as a salvation for the country, but he, like Chavez, disappointed me,"" Silva said.
Guaido has been recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate leader. But, despite growing U.S. sanctions, Maduro has retained the support of the military and control of state apparatus.
Last month, Guaido struggled to launch a new wave of street protests. Attendance was a fraction of the crowds he drew earlier this year.
His flagging momentum has caused some of his fellow lawmakers to start jostling for a new leadership battle, though most have not yet started criticizing him publicly, according to interviews with analysts and politicians.
""The political reality we have had in Venezuela for the last 10 months has finished,"" said Dimitris Pantoulas, a Caracas-based political analyst. ""It's the end of this era of harmony and unity.""
Emilio Grateron, the national coordinator for Guaido's Popular Will party, said in an interview that Guaido remained the ""indisputable leader"" of the opposition, but acknowledged the scandal had opened a ""rupture.""
ILLICIT PAYMENTS SUSPECTED
On Sunday, Armando.info, a Venezuela-focused news outlet, reported that the nine implicated lawmakers had written letters of support to the U.S. Treasury and others for a Colombian man named Carlos Lizcano who authorities were investigating over his possible links to Alex Saab, another Colombian who is under U.S. sanctions.
However, the news outlet said, the lawmakers wrote the letters despite being aware of evidence that tied Lizcano to Saab, who has been accused of corruption associated with Maduro's state-backed food distribution program.
Guaido said he suspected the legislators received illicit payments in exchange for writing the letters and called it ""unacceptable to use a state institution to attempt to whitewash the reputation of thieves.""
It was not immediately evident if the legislators broke the law. The opposition parties involved issued statements deploring the alleged corruption and promised to remove the lawmakers in question. Lizcano and Saab have not commented.
Grateron said the affair affected a ""tiny group of morally weak"" lawmakers and was not on the same scale as the vast state corruption committed by Maduro's government.
Maduro's government, which regards Guaido as a U.S.-backed coup monger and has consistently denied opposition accusations of corruption in its own ranks, has cautiously celebrated the scandal.
Meanwhile, Maduro's grip on power seems to be strengthening. According to local pollster Datanalisis, Guaido's support had already dipped from 61% in February to 42% in November - before news of the scandal broke.
""We can't become what we are challenging, we can't denounce a corrupt regime and then join those who are corrupt,"" said Ruben Iriarte, a 49-year-old businessman in the eastern city of Ciudad Guayana."

VIENNA (Reuters) - Setting Iran deadlines to explain how uranium particles were found in an undeclared Tehran warehouse could be counter-productive, the new U.N. nuclear watchdog chief said on Tuesday, hoping fresh dialogue will resolve the months-long standoff.
Rafael Grossi, a 58-year-old career diplomat from Argentina, took over as director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday. Arguably the biggest challenge he and his agency face is policing Iran's nuclear deal with major powers.
Tehran has so far failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the uranium traces found by IAEA inspectors at a site that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointed them to, calling it a ""secret atomic warehouse"". 
In September the IAEA's acting chief told Iran that ""time is of the essence"", but there has been no sign of improved cooperation by Tehran since then.
""To put deadlines might not be the best idea,"" Grossi told Reuters in an interview when asked how long he was willing to give Iran to provide an explanation that holds water on the particles of uranium that was processed but not enriched.
""This would for me mean that we would be in a very ... antagonistic relationship where basically one side would be resisting and then I as DG would need to be putting deadlines,"" he said, adding: ""We need to work together ... Time is always of the essence.""
Grossi, a veteran of nuclear diplomacy who worked as a senior IAEA official from 2010 to 2013, has said he already knows some of the main decision-makers in Iran, but he has yet to meet senior Iranian officials since taking office.
NEW KID ON THE BLOCK
He hopes he can help set a new tone with the Islamic Republic in his first face-to-face talks, starting this week on the sidelines of a meeting in Vienna of parties to Iran's landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Iran's delegation is usually led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.
""I'm the new kid on the block in this relationship. They've been there, now they get a new DG, so we have to sit down together, start talking and take it from there,"" he said. 
""Let me start my conversation with Iran. I don't think it would be appropriate, and it would be unfair, to pronounce myself about their attitudes before I sit down with them."" 
Grossi has said he will be ""firm but fair"" on inspections generally, including in Iran, without spelling out what that means. He told Reuters he is satisfied with the work the IAEA's inspections team has been doing.
While he has said he plans to communicate more actively than his late predecessor Yukiya Amano, he said that, like Amano, he would not voice an opinion on the state of the nuclear deal, which has been eroding as Iran breaches the limits it imposes on its nuclear activities one by one, in response to a U.S. pullout from the accord last year and reimposition of sanctions on Iran.
Instead, the IAEA will stick to providing technical updates on Iran's nuclear activities. 

Grossi will be more vocal on other fronts, such as the role nuclear energy can play in reducing fossil fuel emissions. He plans to travel to U.N. climate change talks in Madrid this month.

LONDON (Reuters) - They have hosted each other for state visits and dined at the Eiffel Tower, but the once-budding bromance between U.S. President Donald Trump and France's Emmanuel Macron looks to have turned into a bad date as they traded blows ahead of a NATO summit.
Despite a 32-year age gap and very different personal styles, Macron and Trump have tended to put on a show of being best buddies, shaking hands with a tight grip and a big grin, bringing their wives along to dinners and exchanging gifts.
But after Macron's comments last month about the ""brain death"" of NATO and criticism of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan over Syria, Trump appeared to take the gloves off on Tuesday, landing blow after blow against his one-time ""bon ami"".
""When you make a statement like that,"" he said of Macron's ""brain dead"" critique, ""that is a very, very nasty statement to essentially 28, including them, 28 countries,"" the U.S. president told a news conference with the head of NATO.
""Nobody needs NATO more than France,"" he said, adding that France, where Macron has battled a year of protests against his economic reforms, was ""not doing well economically"". 
As if to rub salt in the wound, the United States announced it would impose hefty tariffs on French luxury goods, wine and cheese, retaliation for a French plan to levy a digital tax on large tech companies, many of them American.
By the time Macron and Trump met face-to-face in London, the atmosphere was frosty, with onlookers ready for some sparring.
Trump wasted little time, saying only half-jokingly that Macron's response to one journalist's question about how France was dealing with returning Islamic State fighters was ""one of the greatest non-answers I have ever heard"".
Macron went on to contradict Trump's account of how Turkey had come to purchase a Russian air-defence system, and the two acknowledged they had problems to resolve over the tech tax and the tariffs threat.
Macron has in the past sought to ride out differences with Trump, emphasizing the need for constructive engagement even when the U.S. president pulled out of the Paris climate accord and withdrew from the nuclear agreement with Iran.
With the possibility of Trump winning reelection next year, and Macron in office until at least 2022, both have an interest in ensuring a squabble doesn't become a bitter break-up.
But if a gift Macron once gave Trump is symbolic of their relations, the omen is not good. During a state visit in April 2018, Macron, Trump and their wives planted an oak sapling from a French World War One battleground in the White House garden.

A few days later the sapling was dug up to be put in quarantine, where it died. In June this year, Macron played down any symbolism and said he would send the Trumps another tree. It is not clear if it was ever sent, or planted.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary has stifled its independent media and imposed a level of control over journalists that is unprecedented in an EU country, according to a joint report from six international press watchdogs that calls on EU leaders to take action.
The report was compiled ahead of a meeting next week at which EU leaders will discuss punishing Hungary for eroding democratic norms under maverick Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
""The Hungarian government has systematically dismantled media independence, freedom and pluralism, distorted the media market and divided the journalistic community in the country, achieving a degree of media control unprecedented in an EU member state,"" the report says.
Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs rejected the criticisms in a posting on Twitter.
""Fact: TV outlet with largest audience, news portal with largest readership, largest weekly (are) clearly pro-opposition,"" Kovacs wrote. ""But report says: opposition media under constant threat, being muted. What?""
Hungary and Poland's ruling nationalist parties have tightened control over the media, academics, courts and advocacy groups, spurring the European Parliament to launch a so-called Article 7 legal process against both the EU countries.
The European Council, which brings together leaders of EU member states, will hold a hearing with EU affairs ministers on Dec. 10 to discuss the proceedings against both countries.
Ahead of that meeting, the six organizations, which include the International Press Institute (IPI), the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF), sent a fact-finding mission to Hungary last month.
""Hungary's situation does not get the attention it should,"" IPI deputy director and mission leader Scott Griffen told Reuters. ""It is important that the EU public and its institutions understand what is going on in Hungary.""
The report said some prominent independent outlets remained in Hungary, but their market weight was dwarfed by pro-government publications.
It said Budapest has ""a clear strategy to silence the critical press (and operate) a pro-government media empire as a vast propaganda machine"".
Critics say that under Orban, state media have become an obedient mouthpiece of his Fidesz party, while the rest of the media landscape is dominated by a conglomerate created by pro-Fidesz businessmen.
Orban's government has denied undermining press freedom."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Leaders of Germany's Social Democrats are leaning away from proposing the party quit Chancellor Angela Merkel's government as they work on a motion to put to delegates at a party congress, party sources said.
Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, leftist critics of the coalition with Merkel's conservatives, won a vote for leadership of the SPD on Saturday, putting Europe's largest economy at a political crossroads.
But Esken and Walter-Borjans, interim SPD leader Malu Dreyer and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz agreed a wording on Tuesday for the motion that avoids setting tough conditions for staying in the coalition, three people familiar with the matter said.
At the congress, starting on Friday, the SPD is set to demand that Merkel's conservatives discuss measures to stabilize Germany's slowing economy and improve an already agreed climate package, the sources said.
A draft of the main motion seen by Reuters showed that SPD leaders are set to call for a large public investment push that should not be hindered by ""dogmatic positions"" such as the government's ""black zero"" budget policy of no new debt.
The SPD shares the view of leading economists and business groups that public investment of more than 450 billion euros ($500 billion) needed over the next 10 years could not be financed through the reallocation of existing funds alone, the draft said.
Public investment should not be limited to times of economic growth, the draft said, adding that high levels of investment would help local authorities as well as construction firms.
""In this sense, steady investment must not be prevented by dogmatic positions such as Schaeuble's black zero,"" the document said, referring to former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, the mastermind of the self-imposed budget goal of not incurring any new debt.

U.S. President Donald Trump last week vowed to designate the cartels as terrorist groups, stirring fears that the United States could try to take unilateral action against them, and prompting the Mexican government to reject any intervention.
The multiple killings in and around the small town of Villa Union, roughly 40 miles (65 km) from the border with Texas, were one of the most serious security incidents since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office a year ago.
In a statement, the Coahuila state government said security forces had killed 17 suspected cartel gunmen in the fighting, an increase of three from figures announced on Sunday.
Four police and two unarmed civilians also died in the bloodletting, which erupted around midday on Saturday when a convoy of heavily armed pickup trucks rode into Villa Union and began shooting up the local mayor's office.
The ensuing battle with police went on for more than 1-1/2 hours, and authorities seized 22 vehicles from the gunmen, including four that had been stolen, Coahuila's government said. Ten suspected gang members have also been arrested, it added.
Lopez Obrador assumed the presidency in December 2018 pledging to pacify the country with a less confrontational approach to security, but violence has continued and Mexico is on track to register a record number of homicides this year.
Concern has grown over his strategy, which he says still needs time, since two major crises in the last two months.
Critics blasted the government as weak in October when it ordered security forces to release the captured son of convicted kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman under pressure from marauding cartel henchmen in the northern city of Culiacan.
Then, in early November, three mothers and six children were massacred by suspected cartel gunmen in northern Mexico, sparking outrage and revulsion at home and abroad.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr is due to visit the country later this week to discuss cooperation on security."

Gunfire rang out at Oshkosh West High School, about 85 miles (137 km) north of Milwaukee, wounding the student and the school resource officer, both of whom were rushed to the hospital, Oshkosh Police Department said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). About 1,700 students are enrolled at the school.
A day earlier a 17-year-old student was shot and wounded inside Waukesha South High School, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee, by a police officer after bringing a handgun into the building and failing to comply with orders to surrender the weapon. Police said the student pulled out a handgun and did not respond to the school resource officer's insistence that he give it up.
In both incidents, a single student was injured, police said. Additionally, in Oshkosh, the school resource officer was injured. 
Oshkosh parents were advised to reunite with their children at Perry Tipler Middle school.
""This incident is being turned over to the state department of criminal investigations,"" Oshkosh Police said on Facebook.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain holds an election on Dec. 12, a political gamble by Prime Minister Boris Johnson who sees it as his best chance to break the deadlock in parliament over Brexit.
The parties are on the campaign trail, traveling the length and breadth of the United Kingdom to drum up support.
Following are some colorful snapshots from the election trail:
GOVERNMENT BORROWING UP
Johnson's efforts to stimulate the local economy in the English city of Salisbury ran out of cash of Tuesday.
Touring local businesses during a campaign visit to a Christmas market, Johnson visited a local butcher and helped out behind the till at one stall, serving up sweets in front of a phalanx of cameras.
But the prime minister, whose Conservatives have cast themselves as the party of fiscal discipline during the election campaign, came unstuck when he tried to pay for a box of chocolate brownies.
Fumbling through his wallet, Johnson had to ask his team for a loan.
""I'm out of cash"" he said, before someone eventually handed him a 10 pound ($12.83) note. ""I lashed out on some sausages earlier on and it cleaned me out!""
CORBYN'S LITTLE RED BOOK
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, carries a little red book with him all over the country.
Not the famous collection of quotations from communist leader Mao Zedong - once brandished in parliament by Corbyn's would-be finance minister - but a handwritten diary of knowledge he has picked up on the election trail.
""The wisdom that is there amongst people all over the country is something that absolutely inspires me, I go around with a notebook everywhere,"" he said during a television interview, waving the book.
""I write notes about everything I do and everywhere I go, because you know what, everyone you meet knows something you don't know.""
His interviewer on chat show 'This Morning' asked: ""What are you going to write about us?""
He replied: ""What a charming morning I am having, what wonderful Christmas decorations you’ve got.""
BEGGING LETTERS
The army of grass roots volunteers who knock on doors, post leaflets and raise money for political parties are a crucial part of the machine that organizers must keep onside.
The Conservatives discovered the perils of failing to do on Tuesday when an emailed appeal for cash donations jarred with some volunteers.
""I've been reviewing our supporter list and it looks like you haven't yet made a contribution to our campaign,"" wrote Conservative Chairman Ben Elliot.
One of many disgruntled recipients wrote on Twitter: ""A big thank you to the super rich Ben Elliot who sent all Tory members an email this morning to shame them if they can't afford to contribute to the ... election campaign.""
Elliot sent a second email four hours later, saying he had ""in no way intended to detract from the invaluable support you have given our party."""

CARTHAGE, Tunisia (Reuters) - Tunisia's prime minister-designate Habib Jemli expects to form a government next week with political independents holding most of the important portfolios, he said on Tuesday.
Jemli, who was named to the job by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party which finished first in October's election, added that he would continue with economic reforms begun under previous governments, but would implement them differently.
""I expect to finish forming the government next week,"" he told Reuters in an interview at the government office in Carthage.
October's parliamentary election resulted in a deeply fractured parliament with no party winning more than a quarter of seats, complicating the process of coalition building.
Jemli said he would give the interior, justice, defense and foreign ministries to political independents who are unaffiliated with the big parties and that Ennahda understood this.
His choice of finance minister is somebody with a high local and international profile able to negotiate with foreign partners, Jemli said, without revealing the person's name.
""Economic reforms and combating widespread corruption in all parts of the state will be my priority,"" he said.
""Reforms are necessary, but with a new methodology. They must be in partnership with the labor union,"" he added.
The union has opposed some government efforts to tighten public spending while foreign lenders have urged lower deficits.
The issue of corruption was thrust further into the political spotlight this autumn with the election of President Kais Saied, a political independent, a week after the parliamentary vote.
Saied, who as president has fewer immediate powers than the prime minister, ran an austere campaign that spent very little money and was portrayed by supporters as a figure of rigid personal integrity.
Tunisia's economy has suffered years of low growth since the 2011 revolution that ended autocracy and introduced democratic rule, with successive governments struggling to create jobs and tame inflation.
Big increases in state jobs and public sector pay after the revolution contributed to large deficits and growing government debt, which the outgoing administration has tried to rein in through reforms backed by the International Monetary Fund.
Jemli said he planned to digitize more government functions, to improve governance of state-run companies, where performance has drastically declined since the revolution, and reduce bureaucracy.
Previous governments had gone wrong in failing to stick to the pledges they had made to international lenders regarding economic growth and the size of the public sector wage bill, he said."
1109,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>",Iran acknowledges security forces killed protesters in nationwide unrest,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian authorities confirmed for the first time on Tuesday that security forces had shot dead demonstrators during what rights groups have said was the deadliest anti-government unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
State television acknowledged killings of protesters, without giving figures, some hours before U.S. President Donald Trump said Iran ""is killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people right now as we speak"".
The unrest, which began on Nov. 15 after the government abruptly raised fuel prices by as much as 300%, rapidly spread to over 100 cities and towns and turned political with young and working-class protesters demanding clerical leaders step down. Protests were snuffed out last week by a security crackdown.
Amnesty International said in a statement on Monday that ""extensive video footage verified and analyzed"" by the organization's digital verification wing showed ""security forces shooting at unarmed protesters"".
State TV said: ""Rioters were armed with knives and weapons. They had taken people hostage by closing all roads in some areas. Security forces had no other choice but to firmly confront them...and rioters were killed in clashes.""
Iran has provided no official death toll, but Amnesty said it had documented the deaths of at least 208 protesters, making the disturbances the bloodiest since the 1979 uprising that toppled the U.S.-backed shah and swept Shi'ite clerics to power.
Iran's judiciary spokesman on Tuesday rejected the death toll given by ""hostile groups"" as ""sheer lies"", the TV reported.
Tehran authorities cut off internet access for a week during the unrest, blocking those inside the country from sharing their videos and information on social media to generate more support.
The TV report said security forces clashed with ""rioters armed with semi-heavy weapons"" in Mahshar, in Iran's oil-rich southwest province of Khuzestan, which suffered one of the highest death tolls. It also said some passersby and some members of the security forces were also killed.
Anger over economic stagnation and reputed graft within the clerical and security hierarchies has been building since last year when Trump pulled the United States out of world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, calling it defective, and reimposed sanctions that have further crippled Iran's oil-based economy.
Iran has accused the United States and its regional allies of fomenting the unrest, which Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described as the work of a ""very dangerous conspiracy"".
Trump, in London for a NATO summit, told reporters on Tuesday the United States did not support the anti-government unrest, but soon afterward tweeted that it did back ""the brave people of Iran who are protesting for their freedom"".
The Intelligence Ministry said leaders of a group planning unrest at universities in Tehran this weekend had been arrested, and that many of the 2,021 people detained in the area around the capital last month had since been released."

TIRANA (Reuters) - Building homes for people displaced by Albania's worst earthquake in decades will not squeeze state spending on other priorities, the prime minister said on Tuesday, as the army blew up an unsafe six-storey building damaged by the disaster.
A total of 51 people were killed in the Nov. 26 quake. After finding shelter for more than 6,300 homeless people in hotels, gyms, tents and social centers, the government now faces the task of assessing the safety of buildings and rebuilding homes.
Prime Minister Edi Rama said the 2020 draft budget would be revised to allocate funds for building homes equivalent to 0.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). That number equates to 7 billion leke ($63.10 million).
""First, we shall not touch the main parameters of the budget because the challenge is not to rebuild for those made homeless by the quake to the detriment of other groups in the population and the economy,"" Rama told a government meeting.
Without a final figure for reconstruction costs yet clear, Rama said he wants not just to get the homeless into houses, but also to spur employment, consumption and economic growth.
He added however that in order to save money for rebuilding, the state would not buy any new cars or furniture in 2020, and except for irrigation, no new projects would be accepted beyond those already planned.
""The rebuilding will be one more tool to help the economy grow, not one to kick it off balance and hurt it,"" he said.
Donations have poured in from Albanians across the world and Rama has asked a group of fundraisers, including a Muslim cleric who has for years been giving new houses to those in need, to pool donations and monitor their use.
A Turkish plane brought in tents on Tuesday, much needed in winter's cold by villagers reluctant to quit land and livestock.
Foreign and Albanian engineers fanned out across Albania's second biggest town of Durres to check whether high-rises needed just new plaster, or were unsafe and had to be pulled down.
The six-storey building blown up by the army in Durres was among six damaged dwellings being demolished on Tuesday.
A former painter and mayor of Tirana who began as premier in 2013 by demolishing illegal buildings to make way for new roads, Rama said he preferred to build new neighborhoods in Durres, the capital Tirana and the townlets of Thumane and Lac.
Albania's draft budget for 2020 envisages economic growth of 4.1% next year and a fiscal deficit of 1.6% of GDP, the narrowest in two decades.
The Balkan country has cut its growth forecast for this year to 3.4% from 4.3% previously, mainly due to falling electricity exports due to lack of rain."

VUCJAK, Bosnia (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrants and refugees stuck in a makeshift camp in a Bosnian forest are struggling to survive in subzero temperatures as snow weighs down on their tents, spurring fears that some may die unless they are resettled soon.
A senior human rights envoy who visited the camp on Tuesday demanded its immediate closure, though a Bosnian government minister said it could take up to a month to move the refugees to a more secure location.
""People are people, not animals,"" said Mauloddin, 24, an Afghan who set off for Europe 3-1/2 years ago. ""You see, ... it's very cold weather, (there is) no sleeping, no food.""
Mauloddin is among some 600 migrants from the Middle East and Asia stuck in the camp at Vucjak, a former landfill site about 8 km (5 miles) from the Croatian border, because Bosnian authorities cannot agree on where to settle them.
Bosnia is struggling to deal with an upsurge in migrant numbers since Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia closed their borders against undocumented immigration. The migrants hope to get to wealthy western Europe and find work there.
Some lacked warm clothes and were wrapped in blankets, some traipsed through the snow and mud in flip-flops to collect firewood. One man brushed snow from the roof of his tent to prevent it collapsing.
""Vucjak must be shut down today,"" said Dunja Mijatovic, commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe. ""Otherwise the people here will start dying.""
Mijatovic added that as a Bosnian citizen whose country generated its own stream of refugees during the wars that tore apart Yugoslavia in the 1990s she was ""ashamed"" of the conditions in the camp, saying they were ""not for human beings"".
Aid agencies have long urged the authorities to close the camp, which lacks running water and electricity. The forest is strewn with landmines left over from the wars of the 1990s. [L8N27G8O3]
""THEY STRIKE US, THEY HIT US""
Security Minister Dragan Mektic said on Tuesday the migrants would be moved to a location near the capital Sarajevo in the next month.
Until then, said Selam Midzic, head of the Red Cross from the nearby town of Bihac, the migrants will have to endure the freezing cold and many will fall sick. The Red Cross is the only organization providing food and medicines to the migrants.
Commenting on their plight, Rezwanullay Niazy, a 24-year-old Afghan, said: ""We spent all our money... We came close to Europe, and now they closed the Croatian and Slovenian borders. When we go there they strike us, they hit us.""
Human rights groups have accused Croatian police of using violence to push the migrants back over the border into Bosnia, a charge denied by Croatian authorities.
""They (the Europeans) really don't want refugees to come to their countries,"" said Niazy."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The world has not done enough to ensure justice is done over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a special U.N. investigator said on Tuesday.
Agnes Callamard, the United Nations rapporteur for extrajudicial executions, called for more action from the European Union and the United States over Khashoggi's murder by Saudi operatives at Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul in 2018.
""I think it is important to recognize that the international community so far has failed in its duty to ensure that there cannot be immunity or impunity for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi,"" Callamard told reporters in Brussels.
Callamard is seeking an international criminal investigation instead of a Saudi trial, but Riyadh has rejected her request.
Hatice Cengiz, who had been due to marry Khashoggi, accompanied Callamard on a trip to Brussels which she said was intended to remind people they were still seeking justice.
Khashoggi was a U.S. resident and a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Eleven Saudi suspects have been put on trial over his death in secretive proceedings. A report by Callamard has called for the crown prince and other senior Saudi officials to be investigated.
The death caused a global uproar, tarnishing the crown prince's image. The CIA and some Western governments have said they believe Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, but Saudi officials say he had no role.
The EU called on the first anniversary of Khashoggi's killing for ""full accountability for all those responsible"" and said there must be a ""credible and transparent"" investigation.
The United States has called for Saudi Arabia to show tangible progress toward holding those behind the killing to account."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's incoming cabinet has already been chosen and will be revealed on Friday, President-elect Alberto Fernandez said in a social media post on Tuesday, as the country and markets watch closely for the make-up of the Peronist's core leadership team.
After weeks of speculation about key cabinet picks, especially for the vital economy role, the incoming center-left leader gave little detail away but downplayed the influence of his vice president-elect, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
""The cabinet is defined. Everything is already chosen and we are all working. We present it on Friday at 6 pm (2100 GMT),"" according to a post on his official Twitter media account. This followed comments made on local radio station Metro 95.1.
Argentina's creditors, energy investors and grains traders are watching Fernandez's picks closely, worried that Latin America's No. 3 economy could shift toward populism after four-years under market-friendly conservative Mauricio Macri.
The president-elect added that Fernandez de Kirchner, a divisive former president who clashed with creditors and the farm sector during her two-term administration, had given advice on the cabinet but denied she had installed her own people.
""Cristina influenced the make-up of the cabinet in the way a person whose opinion I value would but did not fill the cabinet with her own names. We are a united front. What I am looking for is that everyone is represented,"" he said.
Fernandez's team has kept a tight light on cabinet picks, though some key people are likely to play at least some role either in the formal body or as advisers.
Heterodox economists Matías Kulfas and Cecilia Todesca, debt expert Guillermo Nielsen, and academic Martín Guzmán are highly likely to take on economic roles.
Domestic media have also reported that young political scientist Santiago Cafiero, heir to a historic Peronist family, will be the Cabinet chief and that former Buenos Aires governor Felipe Solá will be foreign minister.
One source with knowledge of the matter and some domestic media have also said that Miguel Angel Pesce, an economist, is in line to take the central bank presidency.
VEEP
Fernandez, who will come into office on Dec. 10 after winning an October election against incumbent Macri, faces a string of challenges including reviving stalled growth and renegotiating a painful debt pile with global creditors.
The country's economy has been mired in recession for much of the last year, with annual inflation above 50%, sky-high benchmark interest rates and the central bank forced to drain dollar reserves to prop up a tumbling peso currency.
The economic crisis hammered Macri, who lost by a landslide in an August primary election ahead of the Oct. 27 vote, which sparked a market crash as investors feared political uncertainty with the return of the Peronist left. 
Argentina is in talks with creditors and the International Monetary Fund to ease the burden of the country's sovereign debt, with restructuring talks involving a total of around $100 billion.
Argentine bonds, already trading at historic lows, were hit again on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced surprise tariffs on Monday targeting steel and aluminum imports from Argentina and Brazil.
In a tongue-in-cheek comment about his higher-profile running mate, Fernandez said he enjoyed U.S. series ""Veep,"" where former senator Selina Meyer rises to become president, but that it did not mirror the situation in Argentina.

""To clear up any doubts, I have no plans to resign or leave my position until the last day"", Fernandez said.

The violence between the Gak and Manuer communities broke out on Nov. 27 and it has lasted for days, said Benjamin Laat, information minister for Western Lakes state.
""It was a revenge killing when one of the Manuer was killed by the guys from Gak. The government intervened,"" Laat said.
The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said in a statement that Nepalese troops serving with the peacekeeping force had been sent to the area following reports from local authorities that as many as 79 people have been killed and 101 injured in a series of clashes in Western Lakes.
Oil-producing South Sudan, which became an independent country in 2011, plunged into civil war in 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked former rebel leader Riek Machar as vice president.
After a five-year conflict, Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in September 2018 but they are still struggling to form a unity government.
The conflict killed an estimated 400,000 people, triggered a famine and created Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda."

Such a step could fan already heightened tensions between Germany - and other Western countries - and Russia, following the poisoning of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter on British soil last year. 
Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, 40, who had previously fought alongside anti-Moscow separatists in the Russian region of Chechnya, was shot twice in the head in a central Berlin park in August as he was heading to a mosque.
""We have evidence that a foreign intelligence agency was behind it and therefore the case is going to be taken over by the federal prosecutor this week,"" said the legal source, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.
A suspect was detained shortly after the killing and the news magazine Der Spiegel has reported that his passport number linked him to Russian security services.
Berlin prosecutors, who have so far presided over the case, said the suspect had been caught as he tried to dispose of the presumptive murder weapon in the nearby Spree River, along with a bicycle he had been riding. 
The Russian government did not immediately comment on the development. But the Kremlin said in August that it categorically rejected the idea that there was any link between the killing and the Russian government. 
Russia fought major campaigns in 1994-96 and 1999-2000 against separatists in Chechnya, situated in the Caucasus Mountains on Russia's border with Georgia. Many anti-Moscow fighters from those wars now live in exile and are at odds with the current pro-Russian authorities in Chechnya.

Assuming such a government can be formed, there is still no easy way forward for a country driven toward economic collapse by years of bad governance, corruption and waste.
The least damaging scenario would be a ""soft landing"" guided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), economists say, though IMF support has not been broached in public by Lebanese leaders. The economic crisis is the worst since the 1975-90 civil war.
The following scenarios sketch out what might happen in a situation where Lebanon gets a government with international backing, and in a scenario where deadlock continues.
NEW GOVERNMENT AGREED, EMERGENCY PLAN DRAWN UP
Caretaker Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and his political foes including the Iran-backed Hezbollah agree on a government that is either led by Hariri or has his blessing.
The government would engage with Western and Gulf Arab states over emergency support. A donor meeting could be convened, probably by France. The response may well include an injection of billions of dollars into the financial system by the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states.
But given the scale of the crisis, Lebanon would also need an IMF program, economists say. Aid would be tied to implementation of reforms.
""We have to bring in the IMF,"" said Marwan Mikhael, head of research at Blominvest Bank. IMF support would be vital to ensuring ""an orderly adjustment"", added Capital Economics Senior Economist Jason Tuvey. ""At least you would ensure the banking system would not collapse and protect the poorest in society.""
""The IMF would not be able to lend to Lebanese without a debt restructuring, so that would have to happen one way or another. I suspect the IMF would also push for a currency devaluation. They estimate it (is) 50% over-valued,"" he said.
A negotiated debt restructuring could include ""a haircut"" on large bank deposits, Tuvey said. This would reduce their value while leaving the accounts of smaller depositors untouched so the wealthy would carry the burden.
A senior banker said a deposit haircut could be avoided if a stability strategy was enacted now, but could not rule it in a worst-case scenario. ""You have to do a debt restructuring and the sooner the better,"" the banker said.
Mikhael said a debt restructuring would lengthen maturities and reduce interest rates but not reduce the debt value.
""In the positive scenario, you might have a parallel market for a few months because the capital controls will remain in place until you see things have started to work,"" added Mikhael, who believed the pound's official value would be maintained.
POLITICAL CRISIS CONTINUES
Lebanon remains without a new government.
Dollars continue to leave the banks despite controls. In the near term, this leads banks to block all dollar withdrawals, Mikhael said. ""The parallel market will flourish more, you will have higher inflation,"" he said.
Starved of capital inflows, a sovereign debt default would become inevitable sooner or later. Tuvey said this could happen as early as March. Mikhael said the central bank had enough reserves to cover maturities for a year. ""It can be more but then the forex of the central would be very thin,"" he said.
The drain on currency reserves would leave the government with no choice but to devalue the pound, Tuvey said. ""In this scenario it could be much messier and the currency could overshoot its fair value,"" Tuvey said.
Sovereign debt default ""runs the risk of banks suffering large write-downs on their balance sheets"", he said. ""This is where you run a risk of the collapse in the banking sector.""
The senior banker said the banks' fixed assets including property would help to shield them from collapse.
""If you put in place the stability strategy today, you surely don't have to go into a deposit haircut. But the more you wait, the more painful it will be."""

The two restored diplomatic ties last year and the UAE's vocal support will be welcome by Assad, who has wrested control of most of his country from rebels and jihadis and is seeking to shed his status as pariah to much of the outside world.
Speaking at a ceremony to mark UAE national day on Dec. 2, UAE charge d'affaires Abdul-Hakim Naimi said he hoped ""security and stabiity prevails throughout the Syrian Arab Republic under the wise leadership of President Bashar Al-Assad.
""Syria-UAE relations are solid, distinct and strong,"" he added, according to a video posted by Russian broadcaster RT.
The UAE has begun to forge closer ties with Damascus to counter the influence of its rivals Iran and Turkey. Last December it reopened its embassy there, angering Washington, which has sought to keep Assad isolated.
Washington has lobbied Gulf states including the UAE to hold off restoring ties, sources told Reuters earlier this year.
At the ceremony, Syria's deputy foreign minister Faisal Maqdad thanked the UAE for its support.
""We cannot forget that the United Arab Emirates stood by Syria in its war against terrorism,"" he said.
Earlier in the war UAE supported armed groups opposed to Assad. But its role was less prominent than that of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and mainly centered on ensuring that Islamist forces did not dominate the uprising.
Damascus has restored control over most of the country's territory since support from Russian air strikes began in 2015, tipping the war in Assad's favor."

LISBON (Reuters) - Climate activist Greta Thunberg arrived in Lisbon on Tuesday after crossing the Atlantic from New York aboard a catamaran ahead of her appearance at a summit in Madrid to demand urgent action on global warming.
The boat, La Vagabonde, carried the Swedish campaigner, who refuses to travel by plane, across the ocean so she could attend the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. She will spend the day holding meetings with Portuguese climate activists and resting before her departure for Madrid.
More than 150 supporters turned out to greet Thunberg as she came ashore. Among them was the leader of Portugal's People Animals Nature party, Andre Silva, who praised Thunberg for her role in ""tackling the greatest crisis of our times"". 
""She is prioritizing an increasingly urgent issue in a way politicians just aren’t,"" he told Reuters. 
Her arrival in Lisbon coincides with the release of a bleak report by the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organization, which warns that the past decade is almost certain to be the hottest yet recorded.
Portugal’s environment minister Matos Fernandes thanked Greta for her activism in a letter last Thursday, having already departed for COP25. 
Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said it was a ""great pleasure"" to have her in Lisbon but did not feel it was his place to personally greet the activist.
Thunberg missed last Friday’s climate strike as heavy winds delayed her arrival in Lisbon but she is due to join thousands of activists marching in Madrid on Friday afternoon on the fringes of the COP25.
The conference kicked off on Monday with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres warning that the planet had reached a ""point of no return"".
Top priorities include establishing a common time frame for countries to implement their national climate commitment plans, and resolving the issue of international carbon markets. That issue is the only one from the Paris rule book endorsed in 2015 which delegates failed to agree at last year’s COP24 in Poland.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian authorities said on Tuesday that two sisters should face trial for the premeditated murder of their abusive father, despite calls for leniency in a case that has shone a spotlight on domestic abuse in the country.
Three sisters - Krestina, Angelina and Maria Khachaturyan - are accused of killing their 57-year-old father Mikhail with pepper spray, a knife and a hammer while he was sleeping in July last year.
The sisters, aged 17, 18 and 19 at the time, had endured years of abuse by their father, including systematic beatings and violent sexual abuse, according to investigators' documents seen by Reuters earlier this year.
The case prompted an outpouring of public support for the sisters from people who said they were also victims of a Russian legal system that turns a blind eye to domestic abuse.
More than 364,000 people signed a petition earlier this year demanding the three women be fully acquitted of any crime.
On Tuesday, the Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, said it had completed its investigation and recommended two of the sisters be tried for premeditated murder, which carries a jail term of between 8 and 20 years.
It said it had taken into account the abuse the sisters had been subjected to as mitigating circumstances and that tests had shown the two older sisters were compos mentis at the time of the murder.
The youngest sister, Maria, should be taken into mandatory psychiatric care, the agency said in a statement.
The European Court of Human Rights said in July that Moscow was failing to face up to its domestic abuse problem when it ruled that Russian authorities had failed to protect a woman from repeated acts of violence by her former partner.
Russian legislation does not define or mention domestic violence as a separate offense or aggravating element in other offences, the court noted."

GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A U.S. charity building a tent hospital in the Gaza Strip is causing Palestinian unease by offering foreign medical volunteers the opportunity of weekend tourism in Israel, just across the volatile border.
The facility, to be operated by the U.S. evangelical Christian group FriendShips, had won rare joint support from Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas and their enemy, Israel, which maintains a blockade along its frontier with the enclave.
Now, however, eyebrows are being raised in Gaza over a Holy Land pilgrimage pitch on the Louisiana-based organization's website that is promoting an endeavor to improve health services strained by years of conflict.
The 50-bed encampment in northern Gaza across from Israel's Erez border crossing ""will offer a wonderful opportunity to work in an important and productive project and, at the same time, to see and enjoy the Biblical sites of Israel"", the website said.
Volunteers at the facility would be expected to work and live onsite Monday through Thursday but they ""will be free to go to Israel and tour"" on their days off, it said.
Asked about the NGO's tourism perk to volunteers, Hamas official Basim Naeem said: ""We are certainly against using our people's suffering to market Israel or attracting employees at our people's expense.""
There was no suggestion from Hamas that it was about to scrap the project as a result of the sightseeing offer.
A de facto truce brokered between Israel and Hamas by Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations after deadly cross-border fighting in May included the mediators' support for the field hospital.
Gaza's 13 hospitals often lack equipment for specialized treatments, while its two million residents need hard-to-obtain permits from Israeli authorities to get medical care in Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The FriendShips encampment will have ""telemedicine for worldwide consultation with specialists"" and eventually offer cancer treatment and PTSD therapy, among other services, the NGO's website says. 
""It will either be an uplifting humanitarian tool for our people, or it will be asked to leave immediately,"" senior Hamas official Khalil Al-Hayya said.
FriendShips, which previously operated a tent hospital along Israel's border with Syria, did not respond to multiple requests for comment and it was not clear when the facility would open. 
Israel declined to comment on the project. It keeps Gaza under a blockade, citing security concerns posed by Hamas, with which it has fought three wars and waged dozens of other deadly skirmishes over the past decade.
But the hospital's construction with private U.S. funding drew criticism from Hamas's rivals in the Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank.
""It will be an American-Israeli military base put forward on the land of Gaza Strip,"" said Mai Alkaila, the PA's health minister.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan are to meet on the sidelines of a NATO alliance summit in London, Greek spokesman Stelios Petsas said.
""We hope that the meeting tomorrow will be a meeting where it will be possible to pave the way for a new form of respect for international law and for the two countries' good neighborly relations,"" he told reporters.
Libya and Turkey signed an agreement on boundaries in the Mediterranean last week that could complicate Ankara's disputes over offshore energy exploration with nations including Greece.
Athens says the accord is geographically absurd because it ignores the presence of the Greek island of Crete between the coasts of Turkey and Libya.
Petsas said that following the announcement of the accord with Libya, Greece warned Libya's ambassador to Athens that if he failed to provide clarifications to the Greek government over the deal he would be expelled.
Athens has already sought support from the European Union and NATO, which Petsas said ""could not stand indifferent when one of its members openly violates international law.""
Erdogan has confirmed the meeting with Mitsotakis."

Citing a senior diplomatic source, Kyodo said Iran's deputy foreign minister for political affairs Abbas Araqchi had relayed the proposal to Japan during a two-day visit to Tokyo as a special envoy of Rouhani.
""Iran is seen as hoping to realize such a visit at an early date while Japan is expected to examine it carefully,"" it said.
Japan maintains friendly ties with both the United States and Iran and has previously tried to ease tension between the two countries, which severed diplomatic relations shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah.
In Tokyo, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said he had no information regarding any possible trip to Japan by the Iranian president.
Tensions have heightened between Tehran and Washington since last year when President Donald Trump pulled out the U.S. from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions on the country that have crippled its economy.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has forged warm relations with Trump, traveled to Iran in June to persuade Iran and the United States to resume direct talks and dial down tension. Iran has ruled out talks with Washington unless it returns to the nuclear deal and lifts all sanctions on Iran.
In response to Washington's ""maximum pressure"", Iran has gradually scaled back its commitments under the deal, which curbed Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting most international sanctions.
Japan, which has stopped buying oil from Iran because of U.S. sanctions, is keen to see stability in the Middle East, where the bulk of its oil imports come from.
In October Japan said it planned to send a naval force to Middle East waters to guard ships supplying Japan, but declined to join any U.S. coalition to protect merchant vessels.  
Iran has criticized the U.S. efforts to build an alliance to protect shipping in the Gulf, saying countries in the region can protect waterways used by oil tankers."

BETHLEHEM, West Bank (Reuters) - As the Christmas decorations go up in Manger Square (NYSE:SQ), Bethlehem is preparing for its best Christmas for two decades, the town's mayor and hoteliers say.
Five new hotels are in the pipeline and existing ones are expanding. The town has even extended the opening hours of the Church of the Nativity, revered by Christians worldwide as the place of Jesus’ birth.
But even after three years of relative peace and prosperity, people are still nervous in the small Palestinian town, a few miles south of Jerusalem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
So dependent has Bethlehem become on tourist income that an upsurge of violence anywhere in the volatile Middle East - not just in its near vicinity - spells financial disaster, with nervous tour groups prone to cancelling months ahead.
Sitting in his municipality office overlooking the newly lit Christmas tree in Manger Square, Mayor Anton Salman said Bethlehem looked set to improve upon the 1.5 million visitors it received last year.
""Since three years (ago), things are going up, this year is better than 2018 and 2018 was better than 2017 and it is a continuous increase in the number of tourists who are coming to the city,"" Salman told Reuters.
The main bottleneck, he said, was the tiny front door of the Nativity church, through which pilgrims must crouch to enter. Once vast, it was reduced in size centuries ago by the Crusaders, then again during the Mamluk and Ottoman Turkish eras to prevent looters driving carts into the church.
For the first time this year the authorities extended the church's opening hours from sunset to 8 p.m., Salman said, and in 2020 they plan to enlarge the town’s coach station and to address heavy congestion on the narrow road to Manger Square.
They will even consider asking tourist groups to register in advance in future. ""If the number will be high and the church can’t receive all of them we need to look for other plans that can be helpful,"" he said.
GHOSTS OF CHRISTMAS PAST
This year townsfolk are abuzz about a new attraction - a wooden relic reputed to be from the manger used by the infant Jesus and sent back last week to Bethlehem from Rome.
But the town remains wary. Bethlehem enjoyed good times until the outbreak of the second Palestinian uprising in 2000, which saw years of mutual blood-letting between Israelis and Palestinians, leading tourism to collapse.
Scars remain - most visibly Israel's high concrete wall that towers over the northern entrance to Bethlehem, and separates it from Jerusalem.
Palestinians call Israel's military barrier a land grab. Israel says the cordon of fences, ditches and walls has drastically reduced attacks on its citizens.
The manager of the Alexander Hotel in Bethlehem, Joey Canavati, said his family had nearly given up on the town during the lean years, but now had bookings through to 2021. The hotel plans to nearly double in size from 58 to 110 rooms.
""Business has been booming, we have never seen it like this ever before,"" he said. ""(With) the number of tourists that have been coming in this year we have a huge lack of rooms here in Bethlehem.""

But he added a familiar note of caution: ""It's always about stability.""

""That's why I call him Rocket Man,"" Trump told reporters during a meeting with the head of NATO in London He said he hoped Kim would denuclearize, but added: ""we'll find out.""
North Korea fired two short-range projectiles into the sea off its east coast last week in the latest test of its large multiple-rocket launcher. It was seen as an effort to remind the United States of a year-end deadline Kim has set for Washington to show flexibility in stalled denuclearization talks.
North Korea earlier on Tuesday accused the United States of trying to drag out denuclearization talks ahead of the U.S. presidential election next year.
Trump said he was also pressing ahead with negotiations with allies South Korea and Japan to shoulder more of the cost of stationing U.S. troops in those countries.
He said South Korea last year agreed to pay nearly $500 million a year more for U.S. ""protection,"" and added the United States now wanted additional commitments.
Asked if it was in the U.S. national security interest to have U.S. forces stationed on the Korean peninsula, Trump said: ""It can be debated. I can go either way. I can make arguments both ways.""
""But I do think this, I think if we're going to do it, they should burden-share more fairly,"" Trump said."

Last May, Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan coalition won a shock election victory on the back of popular anger over high living costs and perceptions of rampant corruption, particularly allegations that billions of dollars were plundered from state fund 1MDB that was founded by former premier Najib Razak.
The bill seeks to amend the federal constitution to specify a maximum of two terms for a prime minister, and would require support from two-thirds of the 222 elected members of parliament to pass.
It is scheduled to be debated in March next year.
The constitutional amendment was among a raft of election pledges that Mahathir's coalition made, aiming to root out corruption and limit the powers of the prime minister.
Najib, who held power for nearly three terms, faces dozens of graft and money laundering charges over allegations that he received about $1 billion in funds from 1Malaysia Development Berhad. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he thought Prime Minister Boris Johnson was very capable and would do a good job, moments after saying he did not want to get involved in the British election campaign.
The Dec. 12 election will decide the fate of Brexit and the world's fifth largest economy: Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the EU on Jan. 31 while opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has promised another EU referendum. 
Trump has featured heavily in the British election campaign, where his name is used by the Labour Party as a by-word for a capitalist system that Corbyn, a veteran socialist campaigner, has promised to tear up if he wins power.
In London to attend a meeting of NATO leaders, Trump said he did not want to complicate the election, but then added: 
""I think Boris is very capable and I think he'll do a good job,"" Trump said. He has previously cast New York-born Johnson as 'Britain's Trump' and feted him as the best leader to deliver Brexit.
Johnson's Conservative Party are ahead in opinion polls, but it remains unclear if they are far enough in front to form the majority government Johnson requires to take Britain out of the EU in January.
Trump is a divisive figure for some in Britain, and senior Conservatives are nervous his involvement could upset their campaign.
Trump also reaffirmed his support for Brexit - the central objective of Johnson's election campaign - and denied that the U.S. was interested in gaining access to Britain's National Health Service (NHS) in a future trade deal - the main element of Corbyn's election campaign.
Corbyn wrote to Trump on Monday to ask him to revise U.S. negotiating objectives for a post-Brexit trade deal to ensure Britain's public health service is not included.
Asked if he could work with Corbyn, Trump said: ""I can work with anybody, I'm a very easy person to work with.""
Trump was asked if the NHS could be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks, and responded ""No not at all. I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly.""
The prospect of U.S. involvement in the NHS - an emotive issue for voters that regularly ranks as one of the most important in opinion polls - has been used by Labour in the election campaign to attack Johnson. 
Labour say Johnson wants to sell parts of the publicly funded system off to U.S. companies. Johnson has said that is not true. 

Trump said: ""We have absolutely nothing to do with it, and we wouldn't want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we'd want nothing to do with it.""

VALLETTA (Reuters) - The head of a European Parliament delegation, dispatched to Malta to review the rule of law on the island following a scandal over the murder of a journalist, said on Tuesday Prime Minister Joseph Muscat should step aside immediately.
Muscat has defended his handling of the investigation into the 2017 killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and has said he will only step down as prime minister next month to give time to his Labour party to pick a new leader.
But Sophie In't Veld, who is leading the two-day EU parliamentary mission to Malta, said she was ""not reassured"" after meeting Muscat and Justice Minister Owen Bonnici.
""I think everybody recognizes, including the prime minister himself, that he has made some serious errors of judgment and I would say that staying on longer than necessary is another error of judgment,"" she told reporters.
Neither Muscat nor Bonnici made any immediate comment following the talks.
Caruana Galizia, a campaigning journalist who regularly accused government ministers and business leaders of corruption, was blown up by a car bomb on Oct. 16, 2017.
Police on Saturday charged one of Malta's wealthiest businessmen, Yorgen Fenech, with complicity in the murder. He has denied the accusations and said members of Muscat's inner circle ordered the killing.
Critics, including Caruana Galizia's family, want Muscat to resign immediately, saying he is shielding friends and associates from the investigation. He has denied this.
The main opposition party said on Monday it would boycott parliament until Muscat left office.
A small crowd of protesters hurled eggs and insults at both Muscat and Bonnici as they arrived at government headquarters for Tuesday's meeting. 
""The EU must put pressure on him to go,"" said Caruana Galizia's sister, Mandy Mallia, who took part in the raucous demonstration. ""Fenech wasn't acting alone. The other villains are hiding behind Muscat.""
The widening scandal has cast a cloud of doubt over the democratic credentials of the EU's smallest state.
""Malta is part of the European Union and we all have to abide by the same rules and we can only be in the European Union if we trust each other. The basis for that trust does not seem to be there at the moment,"" in't Veld said.
Although Muscat has acknowledged that some of his decisions in the case could have been better, he has also justified his record, saying the prime suspect is now behind bars thanks to the largest investigation in Malta's history.
Fenech wants legal immunity in return for giving information about the murder plot and about alleged corruption involving Muscat's former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi, among others, court filings showed.

The government has rejected his bid for a pardon. Schembri and Mizzi both resigned last week and have denied wrongdoing.

YANGON (Reuters) - Shelling by Myanmar's military killed a woman and two infants, and wounded six others in Rakhine State on Monday, according to residents and a lawmaker in the town of Mrauk U, where security forces are fighting against an ethnic militant group.
The army unleashed a counter-insurgency campaign against the Arakan Army, which recruits from the region's mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine population, almost a year ago.
The militants are fighting for greater autonomy from the central government, and authorities cut internet access to most of the region in June.
Tens of thousands of people have been displaced across Rakhine since clashes began in December last year, bringing fresh chaos to the region, from which more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a military crackdown in 2017.
Two military spokesmen did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment, while a spokesman for the Arakan Army also blamed the army for the shelling, saying there were no clashes involving its fighters in Mrauk U.
Two pregnant women were among the wounded, and the woman killed in the shelling was a mother of three, Tun Aung Kyaw, a regional MP from Mrauk U, told Reuters.
“The government must prioritize the safety of civilians immediately. They must control their security forces,” he said.
Before the recent fighting, Mrauk U was popular with international tourists who came to see the ancient temples that dot the landscape.
Now, displaced villagers camp in tents in the shadows of the monuments and, in the town, families sleep in bunkers built with sandbags to escape shelling and gunfire.

The Intelligence Ministry said the leading members of a group planning disturbances at universities in Tehran and in other parts of Iran on the country's annual students' day on Dec. 7 had been arrested, according to the official IRIB news agency.
During the recent protests, the group had planned to draw students off the campus of Tehran University to create unrest, a ministry statement said. It gave no further details.
Tehran province governor Anoushiravan Mohseni Bandpay meanwhile said many of the 2,021 people arrested in Tehran province in unrest kicked off by a hike in fuel prices had been released, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency.
""In the recent unrest 2021 people were arrested, many of whom were arrested for the first time based on (their) ignorance and in an emotional atmosphere and were immediately released,"" Bandpay said.
In what may have been the biggest anti-government protests in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic, disturbances began on Nov. 15 after the government announced gasoline price hikes.
But the protests quickly turned political, with demonstrators demanding the removal of the top leaders of the country, one of OPEC’s biggest oil producers.
Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said last week that up to 200,000 people took part nationwide in the unrest.
The spokesman for the Iranian judiciary, Gholamhossein Esmaili, told a news conference broadcast live on state TV that 300 people arrested during the protests were still in custody in Tehran, although the majority of those held had been freed.
An Iranian parliamentarian said last week that up to 7,000 people were arrested in the unrest and rights group Amnesty International said on Monday that at least 208 people have been killed across the country.
Iran has rejected figures on the number of people killed in the unrest but has given no official death toll."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Yumi Ishikawa's feet bled after a day in the high heels required by her job, a memory that led her and other Japanese activists to demand on Tuesday that forcing women to wear certain items be treated as workplace harassment.
Japanese women took to social media in November to insist on the right to wear spectacles at work after reports employers were imposing bans, the latest outcry against strict office dress codes that included forcing women to wear high heels, stockings and makeup, and even stipulating what colour hair they can have.
The labor ministry drafted guidelines in October against workplace harassment - known as ""power harassment"" or ""power hara"", but failed to address the issue of employers dictating how female employees should dress.
""You might think this is nothing, but the fact is that some peoples' lives have been changed because of these rules,"" Ishikawa, an actress and activist, told a Tuesday news conference.
""People have hurt themselves wearing high heels ... and all of these people are women. If we're working the same jobs, we have the right to work under the same conditions.""
Just hours before, Ishikawa and other activists submitted papers to the labor ministry calling for such dress codes to be seen as power harassment under the new guidelines, expected to be finalised this month.
Ishikawa earlier this year began the #KuToo protest movement, sparked by her own memories of being forced to wear 7-cm (2.8-inch) heels at a job at a funeral parlor as well as numerous similar stories from other women.
The movement, whose name plays on the Japanese words for ""shoe"" and ""pain,"" swelled into a viral outcry on social media about women being forced to wear high heels. More than 31,000 people have to date signed an online petition against it.
At the time, one cabinet minister said dress code expectations were ""necessary and appropriate"" at the workplace, though several have since commented that the reports of women being forced to wear contact lenses instead of spectacles at work appeared to violate gender equality rules.
""That's why it was such a shock to not have anything about this in the draft anti-harassment guidelines,"" she said.
""I wonder a bit why we've worked so hard but accomplished so little."""
1141,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 03:56AM ET</span>","Zimbabwe's Mugabe left behind $10 million, some properties: state media","HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's former leader Robert Mugabe, who died in September, left $10 million and some properties in the capital, but no will naming his beneficiaries, details of his estate published by state-owned newspaper the Herald showed on Tuesday.
Zimbabweans have speculated for years about the extent of Mugabe's wealth, with many assuming that he and his family amassed a vast fortune during his 37 years in power.
Mugabe's daughter Bona Chikowore wrote in October to the Master of the High Court seeking to register her father's estate, the Herald reported. It listed assets including $10 million held in a local bank, four houses in Harare, 10 cars, one farm, his rural home and an orchard.
One of the properties is the palatial home known as Blue Roof in an upmarket suburb of the capital where Mugabe lived.
The list does not include several farms that he reportedly owned or a dairy business he ran with wife Grace, or any properties outside Zimbabwe.
The Herald said Mugabe's lawyer Terrence Hussein had also asked the court to register the estate, saying he and the family had not found any will left by Zimbabwe's founding leader.
Under Zimbabwean laws, the estate of a person who dies without a will is distributed between their spouse and children.
""Thus far, we have not been able to locate a will, but have sent out enquiries to other law firms, although the family members are not aware of any,"" Hussein wrote in a letter to the High Court that was quoted by the Herald.
Hussein did not respond to calls and questions from Reuters for comment. Chikowore did not answer calls to her mobile phone.
A diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Harare in 2001 that was published by Wikileaks said Mugabe was rumored to have more than $1 billion of assets in Zimbabwe and overseas but that it had no reliable information. 
Social media posts showing his sons Robert Jr and Bellarmine Chatunga with bottles of expensive champagne at a Johannesburg nightclub and reports of Grace's shopping sprees have offered tantalizing glimpses of the family's lavish spending. 
A legal dispute in 2014 over a $5 million villa in Hong Kong suggested the family had been buying overseas property. The government said it owned the house.
Towards the end of his life, Mugabe complained about the size of his retirement package and said he did not have enough money to pay for the upkeep of the Blue Roof.

Mnangagwa hinted last week that the Mugabe family owned a number of farms in Zimbabwe and that the government would leave them with just one, in line with rules limiting farm ownership.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Tuesday the United States was trying to drag out denuclearization talks ahead of the U.S. presidential election next year and issued a veiled threat to Washington to soften its demands, state media reported.
Ri Thae Song, North Korea's vice foreign minister in charge of U.S. affairs, accused Washington of being ""keen on earning time"" instead of making concessions.
""The dialogue touted by the U.S. is, in essence, nothing but a foolish trick hatched to keep the DPRK bound to dialogue and use it in favor of the political situation and election in the U.S.,"" Ri said in a statement on state news agency KCNA, referring to the initials of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name.
""What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get.""
Ri singled out a U.S. State Department statement calling for ""sustained and substantial dialogue"" after North Korea's test of its new multiple rocket launchers on Thursday.
Negotiations between North Korea and the United States have hit a stalemate after a day-long working-level meeting in October in Stockholm broke down.
Kim has set an end-year deadline for Washington to show flexibility in its position, but U.S. officials have described the deadline as artificial.

Citing an unidentified source close to Russia's Investigative Committee, the state body that investigates major crimes, the paper said investigators had laid the blame at the door of pilot Denis Evdokimov without waiting for the final conclusions of the Interstate Aviation Committee.
Evdokimov denies the charges leveled against him, his lawyer, Natalia Mitusova, told Kommersant, adding that the defense's requests for independent examinations into the incident had been rejected.
Russia's Investigative Committee and operator Aeroflot did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
On May 5, a Sukhoi Superjet 100 operated by Aeroflot caught fire while making a bumpy emergency landing at Sheremetyevo airport, with television images showing it bouncing on the tarmac before its rear portion burst into flame.
Many aboard SU1492, flying from Moscow to the northern city of Murmansk, with 73 passengers and five crew, escaped using the aircraft's emergency slides that inflated after the hard landing.

Rinne's government has been widely criticized over its handling of a two-week strike at Finland's state postal service, Posti, and the Centre Party has suggested it no longer has confidence in him to lead the country.
Finnish tabloid Iltalehti, citing unnamed sources, said Rinne was prepared to hand in his resignation to the president before a debate in parliament scheduled to begin at 1200 GMT.
Rinne said late on Monday he wanted the Centre Party to state clearly whether it continued to support him or not.
On Monday, Centre Party chairwoman Katri Kulmuni said her party wanted to continue with the coalition, but questioned Rinne's role in the Posti strike, which also spread to national carrier Finnair.
The Centre Party is unlikely to push for a new election as it and its coalition allies are trailing in the polls and could lose ground to the nationalist Finns Party.
The Finns came second in last May's election, just behind Rinne's Social Democrats.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has celebrated the completion of leader Kim Jong Un's signature construction project, a new city near the sacred mountain where his family claims its roots, with state media on Tuesday calling it the ""epitome of modern civilisation"".
A massive celebration involving fireworks was held at the city near Mount Paektu on Monday, the official KCNA news agency said. 
The Rodong Sinmun, a ruling party mouthpiece, ran photos of Kim smiling as he cut a ribbon at the ceremony attended by thousands of people, while state television showed beige, green and purple buildings covered in snow. 
The city named Samjiyon is envisaged as what North Korea calls a ""socialist utopia"" with new apartments, hotels, a ski resort and commercial, cultural and medical facilities.
The town ""has turned into an example of a mountainous modern city under socialism, an epitome of modern civilization,"" KCNA said.
KCNA said it could accommodate 4,000 families and has 380 blocks of public and industrial buildings in ""hundreds of hectares"".
The city is one of the largest economic initiatives Kim has launched as part of his drive for a ""self-reliant economy, as Pyongyang calls for Washington to lift economic sanctions in their denuclearization talks. 
But its construction was delayed chiefly due to shortages in construction materials and labor as a result of sanctions imposed to curb Pyongyang's nuclear program.
The delays prompted Pyongyang to mobilize youth labor brigades, which defectors and human rights activists likened to ""slave labor"" as they get no pay, poor food and are forced to work more than 12 hours a day for up to 10 years in return for better chances to enter a university or join the all powerful Workers' Party.
State media has also reported over the past year on factories, families and individuals who sent winter jackets, tools, shoes, blankets and biscuits to Samjiyon, which the defectors said was part of the cash-strapped regime's campaign to source supplies from the public. 

The project was completed despite ""the worst trials"" and ""ordeals and difficulties,"" KCNA said, without elaborating.

Relations between Turkey and its NATO allies have been strained over a host of issues, ranging from Ankara's decision to procure Russian air defense systems to Syria policy. Several NATO members condemned Turkey's decision to launch an offensive into northeastern Syria against the Kurdish YPG militia.
Ankara has refused to back a NATO defense plan for the Baltics and Poland until it receives more support for its battle with the YPG, which it views as a terrorist organization.
Ahead of his departure from Ankara for the NATO summit, Erdogan said he had spoken to Polish President Andrzej Duda on the phone on Monday and had agreed to meet with him and leaders of Baltic countries in London to discuss the issue.
""With pleasure, we can come together and discuss these issues there as well,"" he said. ""But if our friends at NATO do not recognize as terrorist organizations those we consider terrorist organizations ... we will stand against any step that will be taken there.""
A Turkish security source said on Monday that Turkey is not ""blackmailing"" NATO with its rejection of the plans and that it has full veto rights within the alliance.
Turkey, France, Germany and the United Kingdom are expected to hold a separate meeting on the sidelines of the NATO summit. Erdogan said they would mainly discuss Turkish plans to establish a safe zone in northeast Syria, which has until now been met with criticism from Ankara's European allies.

Separately, Turkey has been at odds with Greece and Cyprus over ownership of offshore natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Erdogan said he will also meet with the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in London.

Local governments evacuated some 225,000 people ahead of the arrival overnight of Typhoon Kammuri, known locally as Tisoy, which weakened slightly and picked up speed as it moved across central parts of the archipelago. 
Kammuri, the 20th typhoon to hit the country this year, brought winds of 150 kph (93 mph) and gusts of up to 205 kph (127 mph), damaging some homes and structures and felling trees and signage in urban areas.

Air travel continued in unaffected areas of the country. 
Pictures posted by social media users showed waves crashing against bulwarks, panels flying off roofs, trees on roads or being battered by strong winds.
Disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said good preparation had minimized the human impact so far. 
""We've seen great improvement in local government management of preparations for disasters,"" he told news channel ANC.
""The pre-positioning of supplies was executed well before arrival of the storm.""
Authorities warned of storm surges of up to three meters and floods and landslides from heavy winds and rain. 
Government offices and schools were closed in Metropolitan Manila and affected areas and utilities firms appealed for patience ahead of anticipated power outages. The coastguard halted commercial sea travel in affected areas. 
Worst hit was the airport in Legazpi City, where television footage showed structural damage and cables, lighting and panels hanging from the ceiling over departure areas.
Provincial governor Al Francis Bichara said it was important that a mandatory evacuation of tens of thousands of families had taken place.
""The wind was so terrible,"" he said. ""Some of their houses were badly damaged.""

Najib is accused of illegally receiving 42 million ringgit ($10 million) from former 1MDB unit SRC International and was ordered to present his defense in November after a judge ruled prosecutors had successfully established a case against him.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power in the SRC case. 
Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, who leads Najib's defense team, said in an opening statement ahead of the former premier's testimony, that his client had no reason to believe that proceeds of any illegal activity were transferred to him. 
""(Najib) was not involved in any corrupt arrangement involving funds of SRC and did not solicit any bribes from any person,"" he said.
Najib, clad in a blue suit, took the oath in both English and Malay before starting to read from his 243-page-long written testimony in Malay.
His testimony, in a question and answer format, began with how he set up 1MDB in 2009 and how the fugitive Malaysian financier Jho Low, said to be at the center of the scandal, came to be associated with the fund.
""(Low) portrayed himself as someone influential in the Middle East countries who I believed was able to facilitate investments and partnerships between them,"" Najib said, speaking calmly and deliberately to a packed courtroom. 
Low has been charged in Malaysia and the United States over the alleged theft from 1MDB. Low has denied any wrongdoing. His whereabouts are unknown.
The U.S. Department of Justice has said about $4.5 billion siphoned from 1MDB was used by Low and his associates to buy a yacht, a private jet, as well as Picasso paintings, jewelery, and real estate.
Najib, who unexpectedly lost a general election last year, is now facing dozens of graft and money laundering charges over allegations that he received about $1 billion in 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.
If convicted, Najib, 66, could face hefty fines and jail terms ranging from 15 to 20 years on each charge.

YANGON (Reuters) - Bangladesh is blocking hundreds of thousands of Rohingya children from accessing meaningful education, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday, urging authorities to lift restrictions on schooling in refugee camps.
In a report called 'Are we not human?', Human Rights Watch accused Bangladesh of violating the rights of 400,000 school age children who have fled Myanmar and are currently living in the Cox's Bazaar refugee camps.
""Depriving an entire generation of children of education is in no one’s interest,"" Bill Van Esveld, associate children's rights director at Human Rights Watch told Reuters. ""The international community needs to act and demand that Bangladesh and Myanmar change course.""
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh since a 2017 crackdown by Myanmar's military, which followed attacks by Rohingya insurgents.
The Human Rights Watch report said Bangladesh had banned Rohingya refugees from enrolling in schools outside the camps or taking national exams and also barred U.N. agencies and foreign aid groups from giving formal accredited education.
It accused Myanmar of not agreeing to recognize the use of its school curriculum in the camps.
Bangladesh’s Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission Chief Mahbub Alam Talukder said it was untrue that children in the camps were not being educated and that there were 4,000 learning centers in the camps.
""Rohingya will have to go back to Myanmar,"" he told Reuters. ""They are not our citizens and we can’t allow them to use our national curriculum.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - An explosion of a suspected smoke grenade on Tuesday at a park near Indonesia's presidential palace in the heart of the capital injured at least two military personnel, Jakarta's police chief said.
However, President Joko Widodo was not at the palace at the time, a presidential spokesman said.
It was not immediately clear if the blast was the result of a sectarian attack, but Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, has suffered a resurgence in homegrown militancy in recent years.
The explosion, at 7:15 a.m.(0015 GMT) on the north side of the park, was thought to have been caused by a smoke grenade, Jakarta police chief Gatot Eddy Pramono told a televised news conference.
It injured two military personnel who were there for exercise, Jakarta military chief Eko Margiyono said, adding that they were taken to hospital and were conscious.
""A smoke grenade was found and we're looking into why it was there,"" Margiyono said, in comments aimed at reassuring the public that described the incident ""as not so extraordinary"". 
Asked if the blast was the result of an attack, Pramono responded, ""We haven't concluded so, because we're still investigating.""
Within three hours, authorities had reopened the park area where the blast took place, across the street from the headquarters of Indonesia's home ministry. 
Last month, six people were wounded after a 24-year-old university student blew himself up outside police headquarters in the Indonesian city of Medan.
The attack was linked to the Islamic State-inspired Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), responsible for a series of attacks across the country.

In October, a suspected Islamist stabbed and wounded former security minister Wiranto at a function to open a university building. Wiranto, who uses just one name, like many Indonesians, had to have surgery, but has since left hospital.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - A Honduran court on Monday handed down jail terms of up to five decades for seven men convicted of the 2016 murder of indigenous activist Berta Caceres, who led a battle against a major dam on the ancestral lands of her Lenca tribe.
""Five of those accused of the murder...were sentenced to 50 years in jail and another two to a term of 30 years,"" said court spokeswoman Lucia Villars.
Honduran law gives the men 20 days to appeal the sentences.
Caceres, shot to death at her home in the town of La Espernanza, was a veteran land rights activist who started out in the early 1990s, setting her sights on illegal logging.
Since 2006, she had organized opposition to the $50-million Agua Zarca hydroelectric dam, where building came to a halt after completing as much as a fifth of the project.
Lenca activists criticized the dam on the Gualcarque River for what they said would probably cause major disruptions to their water and food supply, and faulted the project for a lack of required indigenous consultations.
Those already convicted include an employee of the Honduran project operator Desarrollos Energeticos, or DESA; an active duty military officer and a retired officer who was a DESA employee.
While DESA ran the project, Chinese state-owned Sinohydro, one of the world's largest dam developers, was originally contracted to build it but eventually backed out in 2013.
The sentences announced on Monday, nearly a year after the seven men were convicted, were harshly criticized by Caceres' daughter Olivia Zuniga, who said they sidestepped the larger culprits.
""This is a day of pain because the intellectual authors of my mother's murder are still enjoying impunity,"" Zuniga told reporters. ""We are not going to believe that there's true justice until these people are in jail.""
Zuniga has in the past accused the Atala-Zablah family, a prominent Honduran business group and major DESA shareholders, of being behind the murder.
Both the family and representatives of the business group have denied the accusation.
In a separate case, Roberto David Castillo, a former DESA executive president who had led the dam's construction, was arrested in March of last year and accused by prosecutors of being behind the murder.
It is unclear when his trial will conclude.
DESA has rejected accusations that it was responsible for Caceres' murder."

YANGON (Reuters) - As Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi prepares to travel to the Netherlands to fight charges of genocide against her country at the International Court of Justice, her supporters have embarked on an impassioned publicity campaign.
Suu Kyi's reputation overseas has sunk to its lowest ebb over the treatment of Rohingya Muslims but the Nobel Peace Prize laureate enjoys overwhelming support at home, where her image is undented by accusations of complicity in atrocities.
On Sunday, several hundred people gathered in downtown Yangon for the third in a series of rallies organized by supporters since the announcement was made that she would personally fight the charges.
“Aung San Suu Kyi is the bravest leader in the world,” Saw Phoe Kwar, a reggae singer known for his hits ‘Love Each Other’ and ‘Stop the Hate’, told the crowds, who waved flags and chanted.
""We must show our unity,"" said protest organizer Aung Thu. ""If a country's leader says a lemon is sweet, we have to say it is sweet.""
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since a 2017 crackdown by Myanmar’s military, which U.N. investigators say was carried out with ""genocidal intent"". 
Buddhist majority Myanmar denies genocide, saying the army was fighting militants who attacked security posts.
Gambia, a tiny, mainly Muslim West African state that has the backing of the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), lodged a lawsuit last month against Myanmar for genocide, including mass murder and rape.
Suu Kyi’s office said she would fly to The Hague for the first hearings, from Dec. 10, to ""defend the national interest of Myanmar"".
Though the rallies organized by her ardent supporters have been modest in size, there are other signs that Suu Kyi has gathered popular support through her decision.
Recent days have brought a revival of an online 'Stand with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi' campaign, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users changing their profile pictures to images of the state counselor. 
The campaign first went viral at the height of the 2017 violence.
Pencilo, a popular social media influencer, implored her 1.1 million Facebook fans to join her on a group trip to The Hague, using a travel agent offering discounted tickets.
WAVE OF SUPPORT
Across Myanmar, the Rohingya are reviled as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh although they can trace their ancestry back hundreds of years and allegations of atrocities against them are widely disavowed as fake news.
It is the one issue that has united the civilian government and the military, which ruled for half a century before Suu Kyi won an election by a landslide in 2015.
Now running Myanmar as State Counselor, the longtime democracy activist spent 15 years imprisoned in her house by the former ruling military junta whose generals still hold key cabinet posts.
Last week, her government said it was ""heartening to see that people from all walks of life ... are expressing their strong support for the State Counselor and her leadership in the endeavors to contest the case at the ICJ.""
Yangon-based political analyst Khin Zaw Win said Suu Kyi was garnering support by using a familiar script of ""evil forces out there ganging up on the brave, heroic leader"".
Other dissenting voices come from Myanmar’s myriad ethnic minority groups, who have criticized Suu Kyi – from the Bamar Buddhist majority – for failing to keep a promise to end fighting with armed groups seeking greater autonomy.
Fighting in the borderlands has escalated and groups such as the Shan and Kachin also accuse the military of atrocities.
Three of the most active ethnic armed groups released a statement supporting the ICJ investigation, while the chairman of another, the Karen National Union, repudiated reports that they had agreed to support the government.
""The situation that Rohingya are facing is the same situation Karen experienced long ago,"" the group's former vice-chairwoman, Naw Zipporah Sein, told Reuters, ""The military did that to the Karen. Now the military has done it to the Rohingya.""

(The story corrects to 'most active ethnic armed groups, not 'largest ethnic armed groups', in paragraph 21)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House Intelligence Committee report laying out the Democratic case for President Donald Trump's impeachment will be publicly released on Tuesday, the panel's chairman said in a television interview.
""We’re putting the finishing touches on the report, which will be released tomorrow,” Democrat Adam Schiff said on MSNBC on Monday night.
The Democratic-controlled panel is expected to vote on the report's approval on Tuesday night.
A copy of the report was made available privately to House Intelligence members on Monday night for a 24-hour review period. 
Republican Representative Jim Jordan, an ardent defender of Trump, told reporters he had read portions of the report in a secure room at the Capitol but was instructed not to discuss the contents until Tuesday night.
House Republicans issued their own rebuttal report on Monday, saying Democrats had not established an impeachable offense by Trump.
Democrats have been looking into the Republican president's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, the former U.S. vice president who is seeking the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the 2020 election, and his son Hunter Biden, who was a board member of a Ukrainian energy company.
Congressional Democrats on Monday named the four witnesses who will testify this week at a public hearing in the impeachment inquiry of Trump, in what is seen as a likely precursor to the announcement of formal charges within weeks.
As opinion polls show Americans are bitterly divided over whether to impeach Trump, the Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will feature four legal scholars discussing the constitutional grounds for removing a U.S. president from office.
The impeachment inquiry has heard testimony from current and former officials that military aid was withheld from Ukraine and that a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was conditioned on investigations into the Bidens and a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine interference in the 2016 U.S. election. 
Trump has denied any wrongdoing and says a July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy, in which he pressed for the probes, was ""perfect."" He and fellow Republicans say Democrats are seeking to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election.
Wednesday's hearing, while academic in nature, will set the stage for the Judiciary Committee to begin determining whether Trump should face formal articles of impeachment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to supporters last week that Trump had committed ""bribery"" and needed to be held accountable.
The hearing witnesses, announced by the committee on Monday, are Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School, Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School, Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law and Jonathan Turley of the George Washington University Law School.
In a defiant response on Sunday night, the White House informed Democrats that Trump and his lawyers would not participate in Wednesday's hearing, citing a lack of ""fundamental fairness."" 
Speaking to reporters as he departed the White House on Monday en route to London for a NATO summit, Trump said he had declined to participate in the hearing because it was a hoax.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called the White House's decision ""unfortunate"" and said that allowing Trump to participate had been a priority from the outset of the impeachment probe.
FRIDAY DEADLINE
White House counsel Pat Cipollone has not ruled out taking part in future proceedings if Democrats address a list of procedural complaints.
The committee, which is not expected to consider evidence against Trump until next week, has given the president until 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) on Friday to say whether he plans to mount a defense by calling witnesses and introducing evidence.
The 110-page House Republican report said the witnesses called during the impeachment inquiry had painted a picture of ""unelected bureaucrats"" who ""fundamentally disagreed with President Trump's style, world view and decisions,"" and had presented no evidence that amounted to an impeachable offense. (Read report https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-02-Report-of-Evidence-in-the-Democrats-Impeachment-Inquiry-in-the-House-of-Representatives.pdf )
Schiff said the Republican report ""ignores voluminous evidence that the president used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rival,"" which Schiff said was outside the law and ""a violation of his oath of office.""
If the House approves articles of impeachment, the Republican-controlled Senate would hold a trial to see if Trump should be removed from office. That move is unlikely, as few Senate Republicans have shown an appetite for removing the president.
But the impeachment inquiry has cast a shadow over Trump's already tumultuous presidency and sharpened a divide among Americans that is likely to intensify as election campaigning heats up in the coming weeks.

Democratic aides said a vote on possible articles of impeachment would follow quickly on the heels of an evidentiary hearing.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 09:43PM ET</span>",Senior Chinese diplomat set for first visit to South Korea in five years amid missile defense row,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - A high-ranking Chinese diplomat is visiting Seoul this week for the first time in five years as the two countries seek to improve ties amid a spat over a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea.
The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, is set to arrive on Wednesday for a two-day stay, during which he will meet his counterpart, Kang Kyung-wha, and President Moon Jae-in, Seoul officials said.
South Korea sees China as instrumental in reviving stalled denuclearization talks between the United States and North Korea, a longtime ally of Beijing.
Wang's visit will be his first since a dispute erupted over the installation of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in South Korea, though he and Kang have talked on other occasions.
The United States and South Korea, meanwhile, have been locked in an increasingly public disagreement over how much Seoul should pay for hosting some 28,500 U.S. troops.
South Korea's foreign ministry said Wang's visit would be a chance to bolster relations ""for new development,"" with bilateral and regional issues on the agenda.
Both sides are expected to primarily discuss Moon's planned attendance at a trilateral summit in China with Japan, and a possible visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea next year.
MISSILE TENSIONS
The United States suggested setting up the THAAD system to address North Korea's missile threats, and a total of six interceptor batteries were installed at the southeastern air base of Seongju by 2017.
Beijing angrily denounced the move, saying the system's powerful radar could penetrate into Chinese territory and was part of a U.S. drive to establish a global missile shield.
The row resulted in a sharp slump in South Korea's tourism, cosmetics and entertainment industries, which had prospered thanks to Chinese demand. China is South Korea's biggest trading partner.
After Moon took office in 2017, the two sides sought to mend ties through an agreement under which South Korea recognized China's concerns and promised not to deploy additional interceptors.
But the economic relationship has not fully recovered, industry officials said.
""China ties have rather been somewhat neglected after the THAAD rift had died down somewhat, but there are still several points of friction, including THAAD and China's air defense zone intrusions,"" said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.
REDUCING MISCOMMUNICATION
Chinese military aircraft frequently violate South Korea's air defense zone, creating another source of contention.
On Friday, South Korea's military said it scrambled jets after a Chinese warplane repeatedly entered the Korea air defense identification zone over three and a half hours.
In July, South Korean warplanes fired flares and warning shots near a Russian warplane that violated South Korean airspace during the first long-range joint regional air patrol by Chinese and Russian aircraft.
South Korea is seeking to open additional military hotlines with China to improve communications. The two countries' defense ministers discussed the issue on the sidelines of an international conference in Bangkok last month, Seoul's defense ministry said.
""Wang's visit may not be enough to resolve all the disputes, but could be a starting point, as long as China doesn't demand drastic action especially over THAAD,"" Shin said."
1155,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 09:16PM ET</span>",Trump administration asks top court to allow it to resume federal executions,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday asked the Supreme Court to allow the resumption of the death penalty at the federal level after a 16-year hiatus, hours after an appeals court blocked the department's bid to pave the way for four scheduled executions.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the department's request to overturn a judge's decision that at least stalled plans for executing four convicted murderers. The first was scheduled to die on Dec. 9.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan last month issued a stay putting on hold the planned executions until a long-running legal challenge to the department's lethal injection protocol can be resolved. The appeals court found that the administration had ""not satisfied the stringent requirements"" to block Chutkan's ruling.
In its application to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department called the district court's position ""fundamentally flawed"" and argued that the legal challengers' case ""wholly lacks merit.""
It was not immediately clear when the conservative-leaning Supreme Court would take up the case. Five of the court's nine justices were nominated by Republican presidents, including two named by President Donald Trump.
Attorney General William Barr, appointed by Trump earlier this year, announced in July plans to resume executions of people sentenced to death in federal cases. 
Barr said at the time his department owed it to crime victims and their families to carry out sentences imposed under the U.S. criminal justice system.
Most executions in the United States have been carried out by individual states, although an increasing number of them have stopping using the death penalty.
The last federal execution took place in 2003. Since then, protracted litigation over the drugs historically used in lethal injection executions prevented the government from continuing the practice.
Shawn Nolan, a lawyer for the men facing federal execution, welcomed the court's ruling.
""The courts have made clear that the government cannot rush executions in order to avoid judicial review of the legality and constitutionality of its new execution procedure,"" Nolan said.
DRUG PROTOCOL
The lawsuits challenging federal lethal injections, the first of which was filed in 2005, challenged the protocol on the grounds that it violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment by carrying a risk of severe pain. 
The lawsuits also said the protocol violated a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act because it was written in secret without public input.
Under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, the Justice Department abandoned its previous three-drug protocol because of a shortage of one of them, an anesthetic called sodium thiopental. The legal fight fell dormant during Obama's tenure but was revived in July.
Barr scheduled the executions of five inmates for December and January and unveiled a protocol that involved using a single drug, pentobarbital, for lethal injections.
Four of the five inmates have joined the 2005 lawsuit. They have argued that a U.S. law called the Federal Death Penalty Act requires the federal government to follow the ""manner"" of execution prescribed in the state where an inmate was convicted.
The law, as a result, prevents the federal government from creating a single nationwide execution protocol, they argued.
Chutkan ruled that the condemned inmates were likely to succeed on their claims that the protocol violated the Federal Death Penalty Act, and found that Barr likely had overreached his authority.
Daniel Lewis Lee, a white supremacist convicted in Arkansas of murdering a family of three, was scheduled to be the first of the inmates to be executed, at a federal prison in Indiana on Dec. 9.

A fifth inmate whom Barr had ordered executed, Lezmond Mitchell, won a stay of execution from another federal appeals court in October.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 09:16PM ET</span>",North Carolina panel of judges rule in favor of new congressional map,"By Brendan O'Brien
(Reuters) - A panel of judges in North Carolina ruled on Monday that a new congressional map approved by lawmakers last month will be used for the state's 2020 primaries, saying there was not enough time to determine whether it was a form of partisan gerrymandering.
The same three-judge Wake County Superior Court panel several weeks ago blocked the state from using a congressional map created in 2016 in next year's elections, suggesting that map's boundaries were gerrymandered to favor Republicans.
Monday's decision clears the way for candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives to file their paperwork to represent new districts drawn on Nov. 15 by North Carolina's Republican-controlled General Assembly. The primaries will be held March 3.
""The net result is the grievous and flawed 2016 map has been replaced,"" Judge Paul Ridgeway said during a hearing, the Charlotte Observer newspaper reported.
The congressional map was drawn without partisan goals or data, Assemblymen David Lewis and Destin Hall, the Republican co-chairs of the house's congressional redistricting committee, said in a statement. 
""It's time now to stop the endless litigation and out-of-state lawyering around North Carolina's redistricting process and let the people determine their congressional representatives,"" they said.
Republicans hold 10 of the state's 13 U.S. House seats, despite a nearly even split between Democratic and Republican votes in the popular count. Republicans across the United States hope to recapture the House of Representatives after Democrats swept to power in that chamber last year.
State Democratic officials were not celebrating the ruling.
""North Carolina Republicans yet again run out the clock on fair maps, denying justice to North Carolina voters and forcing our state to go another election using undemocratic district lines,"" the state's Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin said in a statement. 
In June, the Supreme Court sided with Republican lawmakers in North Carolina and Democratic legislators in Maryland who drew electoral district boundaries that were challenged by voters as so politically biased that they violated rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

Last year, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out the state's U.S. congressional lines. The new map was credited with helping Democrats split the state's 18 congressional seats in 2018 after years of Republican dominance.

Hu said in a tweet that China is also considering visa restrictions against U.S. officials and lawmakers with ""odious performance"" on the Xinjiang issue, in retaliation to legislation being prepared by the U.S. Congress. He did not say how he had obtained the information.
U.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs, and members of other largely Muslim minority groups, have been detained in camps in the remote Xinjiang region. Top U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have criticized China publicly on the situation there.
China has denied mistreatment at the camps, which Beijing says provide vocational training to help eliminate religious extremism and teach new skills to people of the region. It has repeatedly demanded that U.S. and other foreign states critical of its policies in Xinjiang end their interference in China's domestic affairs."
1158,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 08:47PM ET</span>","China bars U.S. military ships, aircraft from Hong Kong, sanctions U.S.-based NGOs","BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday banned U.S. military ships and aircraft from visiting Hong Kong and slapped sanctions on several U.S. non-government organizations for allegedly encouraging anti-government protesters in the city to commit violent acts.
The measures were a response to U.S. legislation passed last week supporting the protests which have rocked the Asian financial hub for six months. It said it had suspended taking requests for U.S. military visits indefinitely, and warned of further action to come.
""We urge the U.S. to correct the mistakes and stop interfering in our internal affairs. China will take further steps if necessary to uphold Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and China's sovereignty,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a news briefing in Beijing.
China last week promised it would issue ""firm counter measures"" after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which supports anti-government protesters in Hong Kong and threatens China with sanctions for human rights abuses.
There are fears that the dispute over Hong Kong could impact efforts by Beijing and Washington to reach a preliminary deal to de-escalate a prolonged trade war between the world's two largest economies. 
In more normal times, several U.S. naval ships visit Hong Kong annually, a rest-and-recreation tradition that dates back to the pre-1997 colonial era and one that Beijing allowed to continue after the handover from British to Chinese rule.
""We have a long track record of successful port visits to Hong Kong, and we expect that to continue,"" said a U.S. State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""False accusations of foreign interference"" against the U.S. NGOs ""are intended to distract from the legitimate concerns of Hongkongers,"" the official said.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Dave Eastburn said port visits to Hong Kong and elsewhere around the world served as a useful program to ""provide liberty for our sailors and expand people-to-people ties with our hosts"".
""With regard to the ongoing protests, we condemn the unjustified use of force and urge all sides to refrain from violence and engage in constructive dialogue,"" he said in a statement.
A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said China's move would not have an impact on U.S. military operations.
Visits have at times been refused amid broader tensions and two U.S. ships were denied access in August.
The USS Blue Ridge, the command ship of the Japan-based Seventh Fleet, stopped in Hong Kong in April – the last ship to visit before mass protests broke out in June.
Foreign NGOs are already heavily restricted in China, and have previously received sharp rebukes for reporting on rights issues in the country, including the mass detention of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.
The U.S.-headquartered NGOs targeted by Beijing include the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the International Republican Institute, Human Rights Watch, and Freedom House.
""They shoulder some responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong and they should be sanctioned and pay the price,"" Hua said.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 07:49PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. defense chief calls on Turkey to stop holding up NATO readiness plan,"By Phil Stewart
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged Turkey on Monday to stop holding up support for a NATO defense plan for the Baltics and Poland, as Ankara presses the alliance to support its fight against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG militia in Syria.
In an interview with Reuters ahead of the NATO summit, Esper warned Ankara that ""not everybody sees the threats that they see"" and added he would not support labeling the YPG as terrorists to break the impasse.
He called on Ankara to focus on the larger challenges facing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
""The message to Turkey ... is we need to move forward on these response plans and it can't be held up by their own particular concerns,"" Esper said as he flew to London.
""Alliance unity, alliance readiness, means that you focus on the bigger issues – the bigger issue being the readiness of the (NATO) alliance. And not everybody’s willing to sign up to their agenda. Not everybody sees the threats that they see.""
NATO envoys need formal approval by all 29 members for the plan to improve the defense of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia against any threat from neighboring Russia.
The dispute, as NATO prepares to hold its 70th anniversary summit, is a sign of deep divisions between Ankara and Washington over everything from the war in Syria to Turkey's growing defense relationship with Russia.
Turkey wants NATO to formally recognize the YPG militia, the main component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as terrorists and is infuriated that its allies have given the militia support.
Ankara has blamed Washington for the current impasse, saying it was caused by the U.S. withdrawal of support from a separate defense plan for Turkey, covering any possible attack from the south where it borders Syria.
Asked whether Washington might agree to branding the YPG as terrorists in order to break the deadlock, Esper said: ""I wouldn't support that.""
""We're going to stick to our positions, and I think NATO will as well,"" Esper said.
The issue is the latest source of friction between the NATO allies, which have also been at loggerheads over Turkey's purchase of advanced Russian air defenses, which Washington says are incompatible with NATO defenses and pose a threat to  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) F-35 stealth fighter jets.
Washington said in July it was removing Turkey from the F-35 program and has warned of possible U.S. sanctions.
Two U.S. senators pressed the Trump administration on Monday to impose sanctions on Turkey over its purchase of the Russian missile defense system and said the failure to do so sent a ""terrible signal."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers pressed the Trump administration on Monday to impose sanctions on Turkey over its purchase of a Russian missile defense system, saying the failure to do so sends a ""terrible signal,"" and a key Senate committee set a vote on additional legislation to punish Ankara.
""The time for patience has long expired. It is time you applied the law,"" Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""Failure to do so is sending a terrible signal to other countries that they can flout U.S. laws without consequence,"" they said.
Ankara and Washington have been at loggerheads over NATO ally Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 system, which Washington says is not compatible with NATO defenses and poses a threat to its F-35 stealth fighter jets, which  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) is developing.
Infuriating many members of Congress, Turkey shrugged off the threat of U.S. sanctions and began receiving its first S-400 deliveries in July. In response, Washington removed Turkey from the F-35 program.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has held off on imposing sanctions despite Trump signing a sweeping sanctions law, known as CAATSA, in 2017 mandating them for countries that do business with Russia's military.
U.S. lawmakers' anger toward Turkey deepened after Ankara crossed into Syria for an offensive against Kurdish militias that had helped U.S. forces combat Islamic State militants.
Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters the committee would vote next week on a separate bill to impose stiff sanctions on Ankara.
Asked if that meant his patience with Turkey had worn thin, Risch told reporters that that had happened a while ago.
An aide said the Foreign Relations Committee would consider the bill, co-sponsored by Risch and Senator Bob Menendez, the committee's top Democrat, on Wednesday.
Normally ardent defenders of fellow-Republican Trump, Graham and some other party members have been harshly critical of the president's decision to withdraw troops from northeastern Syria, paving the way for the Turkish move against Kurdish fighters.
Trump hosted his Turkish counterpart, Tayyip Erdogan, at the White House for a meeting last month that Trump described as ""wonderful."" But there has been no sign that Erdogan has changed his plan to buy the Russian system.
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment. Pompeo said on Nov. 26 that Turkey carrying out tests on the Russian system was ""concerning,"" and that talks to resolve the issue were still under way.
The same day, Russia's state arms exporter Rosoboronexport was cited as saying Moscow hoped to seal a deal to supply Turkey with more S-400 missile systems in the first half of 2020.

(Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, released from one hospital in Georgia the day before Thanksgiving, was admitted to another over the holiday weekend for treatment of a urinary tract infection, the Carter Center said in a statement on Monday.
""He is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon,"" the statement said of Carter, who at age 95 has lived longer after leaving the White House than any former president in U.S. history.
The former peanut farmer and Georgia governor was admitted to Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia, over the weekend, the Carter Center said, adding that its next statement would be issued ""when he is released for further rest and recovery.""
Carter, who resides in Plains, Georgia, was sent home Wednesday from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta following the latest in a string of recent health scares.
He was admitted there on Nov. 11, accompanied by his wife, Rosalynn, 92, for a procedure to relieve pressure from bleeding on the outer lining of his brain - a subdural hematoma - caused by recent falls. Doctors pronounced the surgery a success.
In October, Carter fell twice. The first fall required he receive stitches to his face and the second resulted in a brief hospitalization for a minor pelvis fracture. 
After the first fall, he resumed work on a homebuilding project for the nonprofit group Habitat for Humanity.
In May, the former Democratic president broke his hip, also at home, requiring him to undergo surgery. 
Carter defeated Republican President Gerald Ford in 1976 to become the nation's 39th president, serving a single four-year term in the White House.
His presidency was overshadowed by an economic recession, an energy crisis and the taking of U.S. hostages by Iran, but he also played a leading role in brokering the Camp David accords leading to an Egypt-Israeli peace treaty.
He lost his 1980 re-election bid to Republican Ronald Reagan. After leaving office in 1981, Carter went on to become an international fixture and noted humanitarian. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts toward finding peaceful solutions to global conflicts, advancing democracy and human rights and promoting economic and social development.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has lifted a mysterious ""hold"" on more than $100 million in security aid for Lebanon, congressional and State Department officials said, more than a month after lawmakers learned the funds were being blocked.
As first reported by Reuters, the U.S. State Department told Congress on Oct. 31 that the White House budget office (OMB) and National Security Council had decided to withhold $105 million in foreign military assistance, without providing any explanation.
As lawmakers demanded answers from the administration about why the aid had been withheld, some compared it with a similar decision from the administration to withhold nearly $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine that also had been approved by Congress.
That decision has been at the center of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.
Members of Congress and U.S. diplomats had strongly opposed the move to withhold the aid to Beirut, saying it was crucial to support Lebanon's military as it grappled with instability within the country and the region.
Congressional aides said on Monday the administration had still provided no explanation for the decision to withhold the money, which had been approved by Congress and the State Department.
They said the OMB released the hold last Wednesday and the administration had begun to ""obligate"" it, or finalize contracts for how it should be spent.
A senior State Department official confirmed that the money had been released but declined to provide an explanation for why it was suspended or why it was released, beyond referring to recent comments by Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale.
Hale said during congressional testimony that there had been some disagreements about the efficacy of U.S. aid to the Lebanese armed forces.
On Monday, the senior State official said on a conference call with reporters that Lebanon's army is ""an excellent partner to the United States"" in fighting extremism.
Lebanon also houses thousands of refugees from war in neighboring Syria.

Iraqi security forces opened fire on demonstrators who had blocked a bridge and later gathered outside a police station in the southern city, killing at least 29 people. Police and medical sources said dozens more were wounded.
Iraqi forces have killed over 400 people, mostly young, unarmed protesters, since mass anti-government protests broke out on Oct. 1. More than a dozen members of the security forces have also died in clashes.
""The use of excessive force over the weekend in Nassiriya was shocking and abhorrent,"" David Schenker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told reporters.
""We call on the Government of Iraq to respect the rights of the Iraqi people and urge the government to investigate and hold accountable those who attempt to brutally silence peaceful protesters,"" he added.
The unrest is Iraq's biggest challenge since Islamic State militants seized swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory in 2014.
It pits mostly young, disaffected Shi'ite protesters against a Shi'ite-dominated government that is backed by Iran and has been accused of squandering Iraq's oil wealth while infrastructure and living standards deteriorate.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi announced on Friday he would resign after a call by Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, for parliament to consider withdrawing its support for his government to stem the violence. Parliament voted to accept the resignation on Sunday."
1164,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 06:32PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. troop drawdowns in Afghanistan 'not necessarily' tied to Taliban deal - Esper,"By Phil Stewart
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Monday that any future troop drawdowns in Afghanistan were ""not necessarily"" linked to a deal with Taliban insurgents, suggesting some lowering of force levels may happen irrespective of the ongoing peace push.
The remarks by Esper in an interview with Reuters came on the heels of a Thanksgiving trip last week to Afghanistan by President Donald Trump, who spoke of potential troop reductions and said he believed the Taliban insurgency would agree to a ceasefire in the 18-year-old war. 
If honored by all sides, a ceasefire could lead to a significant reduction in violence. But U.S. military commanders would still focus on the threats associated with two other militant groups in Afghanistan: Islamic State and al Qaeda. 
Speaking as he flew to London for a NATO summit, Esper said the Trump administration had been discussing potential reductions in troop levels for some time, both internally and with NATO allies.
""I feel confident that we could reduce our numbers in Afghanistan and still ensure that place doesn't become a safe haven for terrorists who could attack the United States,"" Esper said, without offering a figure.
""And our allies agree we can make reductions as well.""
Asked whether such reductions would necessarily be contingent on some sort of agreement with the Taliban insurgency, Esper said: ""Not necessarily."" 
He did not elaborate.
There are currently about 13,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan as well as thousands of other NATO troops. U.S. officials have said U.S. forces could drop to 8,600 and still carry out an effective, core counter-terrorism mission as well as some limited advising for Afghan forces.
A draft accord agreed in September before peace talks collapsed would have withdrawn thousands of American troops in exchange for guarantees that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States or its allies.
Still, many U.S. officials privately doubt the Taliban could be relied upon to prevent al Qaeda from again plotting attacks against the United States from Afghan soil.
Esper did not hint at any developments in the coming days or suggest that new troop drawdowns in Afghanistan might figure into NATO discussions this week. 
""I don't think there's any 'new' news right now, if you will. We've been discussing this for quite some time,"" Esper said, when asked if he would raise the issue in London.

About 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed in the Afghan conflict and many thousands more wounded.

Hundreds of thousands of Colombians have participated in protests against President Ivan Duque's social and economic policies over the past two weeks, imperiling the government's tax reform proposal and leading Duque to announce a ""great national dialogue"" on social issues.
""In the face of the national clamor and the economic effects the strike is having, we ask them to suspend the strike on the fourth of December and continue to advance the conversation that we have,"" presidency official Diego Molano told journalists.
Major unions that are part of the National Strike Committee, the group that called the original strike on Nov. 21, have demanded the government meet only with the committee, instead of including business groups and others in talks.
""We've told the National Strike Committee that the government of President Duque has all the will for dialogue without ultimatums, without pressure and for the good of Colombia,"" Molano said.
""And we newly suggested a parallel dialogue to the national conversation so we can start a conversation on the 13 points,"" he added, referring to 13 committee demands, including that the government abandon the tax reform, which would reduce duties for businesses.
The government made the proposal to the committee on Saturday, Molano said, but had not yet received an answer. The Central Union of Workers (CUT) did not respond to a request for comment.
Demonstrators have rallied against economic plans - such as a rise in the pension age and a cut to the minimum wage for young people - that Duque denies supporting, as well what they say is a lack of government action to stop corruption and the killing of hundreds of human rights activists.
The injury and eventual death of 18-year-old protester Dilan Cruz has also motivated demonstrators, who are calling for the ESMAD riot police to be dissolved."

There is no evidence that FaceApp provides user data to the Russian government. But the FBI, in a letter responding to Schumer, said Moscow's ability to access communications directly via internet service providers makes any app built there risky.
Russia's intelligence services maintain ""robust cyber exploitation capabilities,"" the FBI said, and are able under local laws to ""remotely access all communications and servers on Russian networks without making a request to ISPs.""
FaceApp, which launched in 2017, was developed by Wireless Lab, a company based in St. Petersburg. Its chief executive officer, Yaroslav Goncharov, used to be an executive at Yandex, widely known as ""Russia's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).""
The company has denied selling or sharing user data with third parties, adding that user data is never transferred to Russia and most images are deleted from its servers within 48 hours of submission."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has granted a rare reprieve from deportation to a former member of an Irish Republican militant group who had been convicted of crimes committed during the political and sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, a U.S. official said on Monday.
Democratic and Republican lawmakers from New York had lobbied for Malachy McAllister to be allowed to stay in the United States despite a 2017 immigration policy change that raised the legal bar for temporary relief for deportation. He had been due to be deported last week.
McAllister was convicted in Northern Ireland of charges related to serving as a lookout in a 1981 attack on a police officer in Northern Ireland, according to U.S. court documents. He also was convicted of plotting to shoot and kill another officer. He was jailed for seven years but freed on early release in 1985.
A U.S. immigration appeals board ruled in 2003 that McAllister had engaged in terrorist activities and ordered his deportation.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision in 2006 - with notable commentary from President Donald Trump's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, a judge on the court who retired earlier this year. Barry concurred with the court ruling but implored the attorney general to allow McAllister and his family to remain in the United States.
New York Republican Representative Peter King said he pointed out Barry's commentary to Trump when he called the president on Nov. 22 to lobby on McAllister's behalf. King said McAllister, who owned a construction business in the United States, had received a six-month stay from deportation and that the White House was working on a more permanent solution.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment. A senior DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that McAllister had received a six-month stay, calling the move ""an act of generosity"" by Trump in light of lobbying by members of Congress.
""Whatever happened back in Belfast, he’s paid his time,"" said New York Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, one of the lawmakers who lobbied on McAllister's behalf. ""He’s a different person now.""
McAllister was a member of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), one of the Irish Republican militant groups that fought in the ""Troubles,"" that pitted predominantly Catholic nationalists seeking union with Ireland against British security forces and mainly Protestant unionists who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The INLA, which broke away from the larger Irish Republican Army in 1975, around the height of Northern Ireland’s three decades of conflict, called a ceasefire in 1998, the same year the Good Friday peace agreement was struck and mostly ended the bloodshed that cost some 3,600 lives in the British-run province.
McAllister went to Canada with his late wife and their children in 1988, but were denied asylum there, according to U.S. court documents. They entered the United States on temporary tourist visas in 1996, but were ordered deported three years later and subsequently denied asylum, the documents said.
McAllister received regular stays of removal under previous U.S. administrations."

Protests began on Saturday, a day after Abdelwaheb Hablani, 25, set himself on fire and died in hospital in protest at poverty and poor living conditions, echoing the 2010 self immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, whose death triggered the Arab Spring.
Hablani had occasional work as a casual laborer in Jelma, located near Bouazizi's home city of Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia's deeply impoverished interior. He was buried on Saturday.
Witnesses told Reuters security forces fired tear gas and were chasing youths protesting in the streets of Jelma.
Protesters blocked roads and burned tires.
""The situation is difficult here. Police are flexing their muscles and they fired tear gas everywhere,"" Bilel Harzali, a local resident, told Reuters.
""The scene brings to mind the days of the revolution. ...People are angry because the lack of development and the strong security response,"" he added.
Mass protests that followed Bouazizi's funeral in December 2010 toppled the veteran autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who died in exile in Saudi Arabia in September, and introduced democracy in the North Africa country.
Since Bouazizi's death in December 2010, numerous young men have followed his example by setting themselves alight in the face of Tunisia's chronic economic difficulties.
The birthplace of the “Arab Spring”, Tunisia is the only country to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy following the 2011 popular revolts that swept autocrats from power across North Africa and the Middle East.
But since 2011, Tunisia’s economy has been in crisis and nine cabinets have failed to resolve economic problems, including high inflation, unemployment and corruption."

The Dec. 12-13 summit of the bloc's national leaders will aim to endorse ""the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050"", according to the document seen by Reuters.
Previous attempts, however, were blocked by Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, who rely on highly polluting coal. They have previously said they oppose climate neutrality by 2050 for fear cutting greenhouse emissions will stifle their economies.
To convince the reluctant camp, the draft summit conclusions refer to ""just and socially balanced transition"", the European Investment Bank's announcement to unlock 1 trillion euros worth of green investment until 2030, the need to ensure energy security and competitiveness vis-à-vis foreign powers not pursuing such climate goals.
The draft, prepared in advance of the leaders' discussions, may still change. But it will eventually need unanimous backing of all EU national leaders for there to be agreement at the summit.
The bloc's new executive European Commission also aims to push for climate neutrality by mid-century and wants to make the EU's 2030 climate targets more ambitious.
Current targets envisage cutting the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 from 1990 levels. The new Commission, led by Germany's Ursula von der Leyen, hopes to raise the goal to at least 50%."

Corbyn, whose party is trailing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives in the polls ahead of a Dec. 12 election, has sought to make Britain's much-loved National Health Service (NHS) a key battleground in the vote.
Last week Corbyn handed reporters hundreds of pages of leaked documents summarising preliminary UK-US trade talks which he said provided evidence that Britain's state-run health service was being offered up to the United States.
Johnson has said that ""under no circumstances"" would the NHS be on the table in negotiations.
In his letter, timed to coincide with Trump's arrival in Britain for a NATO summit, Corbyn said revising U.S. negotiating objectives would help reassure the British public that ""the US government accepts that our NHS is not for sale in any form"".
His demands included excluding any reference to pharmaceuticals, dropping demands for ""total market access"" to UK public services and ensuring NHS patient data is exempt from digital trade and data sharing provisions in any agreement.
""I am sure you understand that our coming General Election on 12th December means the British public need urgent clarity that our NHS is genuinely off the table in UK-US trade talks and will not be exposed to higher costs from US drugs companies,"" Corbyn wrote in the letter, released by his office.
Last week Johnson said it would be best if Trump, who waded into British politics in October by saying Corbyn would be ""so bad"" for Britain, did not get involved in the election during his visit."

LONDON (Reuters) - An American woman who says she was forced to have sex with Britain's Prince Andrew has appealed to Britons to take her side, saying that only she was telling the truth about a scandal that has engulfed the royal family.
Virginia Giuffre says she was trafficked by the disgraced late U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends, including the British prince when she was 17 years old. Andrew categorically denies the allegations.
In an interview broadcast on Monday, Giuffre said she was brought to London in 2001 by Epstein and taken to meet the prince, one of three occasions when she says she had sex with Andrew.
""He knows what happened. I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,"" Giuffre told BBC Panorama.
""I implore the citizens in the UK to stand up beside me, to help me fight this fight, to not accept this as being ok. This is not some sordid sex story. This is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys' royalty."" 
Andrew, 59, Queen Elizabeth's second son, has said he has no recollection of ever meeting Giuffre, who was previously named Virginia Roberts.
In response to Giuffre's interview, a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ""It is emphatically denied that The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.""
Last month, the prince gave an interview himself to the BBC which he hoped would draw a line under the scandal. 
However, the interview was widely regarded as a disaster for him, provoking days of negative headlines and culminating in him stepping down from royal duties as charities and other organizations distanced themselves.
He said he regretted his ""ill-judged"" association with Epstein and that he had never seen anything suspicious during the time he spent with the financier. However, he said the media blowback it had generated had become ""a major disruption to my family's work"".
Panorama said lawyers for five of Epstein's victims, who are suing his estate, want Andrew to give evidence in their court cases and that pre-trial subpoenas had been readied to serve on the prince if he visited the United States.
Andrew has said he would speak to law enforcement agencies if required.
NIGHTCLUB 
In her interview, which was recorded before the prince spoke to the BBC, Giuffre said she was taken to the Tramp nightclub in London by Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Andrew asked her to dance, she said.
""He is the most hideous dancer I've ever seen in my life. I mean it was horrible and this guy was sweating all over me, like his sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere,"" she said.
Andrew, the eighth-in-line to the throne, said he could not have had sex with Giuffre at Maxwell's home on the night she alleges because he had been to a pizza restaurant in the commuter town of Woking for a children's party. 
He said he suffered from a medical condition that stopped him perspiring and cast doubt on the authenticity of a picture from 2001 which showed him with his arm around Giuffre's waist.
He said he did not remember the photo being taken and that he had never been upstairs in Maxwell's house where the image appeared to have been captured. 
Giuffre told the BBC the picture was genuine and she had given it to the FBI.
Andrew also said he had stayed at Epstein's home in New York after the financier had been convicted of Florida state prostitution charges because he was ""too honorable"" to break off the relationship by telephone and wanted to do so in person.
Those explanations provoked derision and ridicule in newspapers and social media, while the prince was also criticized for failing to show sympathy for the victims of Epstein, who killed himself in a U.S. prison in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

""The people on the inside are going to keep coming up with these ridiculous excuses. Like his arm was elongated or the photo was doctored, or he came to New York to break up with Jeffrey Epstein. I mean come on I'm calling BS on this, because that's what it is,"" Giuffre said.

The Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) blamed its eastern-based rivals for the strikes. It did not say how many people had been killed and injured, but military forces aligned with the GNA said 14 people had died.
The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) denied carrying out the strikes, blaming instead ""indiscriminate bombardment"" by their opponents.
The strikes mark the latest escalation in an air campaign as the LNA presses its military offensive on the outskirts of Tripoli and seeks to retain control over desert areas in the south.
Libya has been divided since 2014 between shifting rival political and military factions based in Tripoli and the east. The LNA has been waging a military campaign since early April to try to take control of Tripoli. 
The strikes hit Al-Sawani, south-west of central Tripoli on Sunday, and Umm al-Aranib town, about 765km (475 miles) away, late last week.
Emergency workers confirmed that three children had been killed and a fourth child injured in the strike in Al-Sawani, which they said damaged some houses and vehicles.
In Umm al-Aranib locals protested against the strikes on Monday, burning tires in the street and closing some schools and roads, residents said. 
After the LNA's offensive in April quickly stalled, both sides became increasingly dependent on air strikes carried out with foreign support by fighter jets and drones. 
The United Nations Libya mission, UNSMIL, said in a statement sent to Reuters that it was ""following with great concern the intensification of air strikes in civilian areas in the past few days"".
""UNSMIL stresses that indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure constitute a grave violation to international humanitarian and human rights,"" it said.
Umm al-Aranib is about 275km directly east of El Feel oilfield, where GNA-aligned forces briefly took control last week before being beaten back by air strikes.

Volodymyr Tsemakh, a Ukrainian national, had been identified as a suspect by the Netherlands, which is leading an investigation into the disaster on July 17, 2014 which killed all 298 people onboard. Two-thirds of the passengers were Dutch.
MH17 was shot out of the sky over territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Investigators say the missile that hit the airline came from a launcher transported from a Russian military base in Kursk, just across the border.
Moscow denies wrongdoing.
Tsemakh is sought by the Netherlands as a suspect, but is not among four men - three Russians and a Ukrainian - who will go on trial in absentia in a Dutch court in March for murder over the downing of the aircraft.
""The Public Prosecution Service has concluded that Russia willingly allowed Mr Tsemakh to leave the Russian Federation and refused to execute the Dutch request. While under the European Convention on Extradition, it was obliged to do so,"" the prosecution service said in a statement.
Russia does not extradite its own citizens, but Dutch prosecutors said there was no impediment in this case because Tsemakh is a Ukranian citizen.
Dutch prosecutors have not yet determined whether or not to prosecute Tsemakh.
Tsemakh, whom Ukraine's security service has identified as a former commander of Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, was transferred to Russia in an exchange of prisoners between Moscow and Kiev in September.
Dutch prosecutors said they had asked Moscow to arrest Tsemakh and hand him over to the Netherlands for questioning, but received a notice on Nov. 19 that Russia could not comply because his whereabouts were unknown."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A blizzard-like blast from a storm that has been raging across the United States since before Thanksgiving slammed the Northeast on Monday, snarling travel ahead of the evening rush hour.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency and deployed 300 members of the National Guard.
Airline problems had more than doubled by midday, with most of the more than 4,000 U.S. flight cancellations and delays at airports in Newark, San Francisco, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and Washington.
Alternating rain and snow showers switched completely to snow by midday, and were forecast by the National Weather Service to pile up by the workday's end to 1 to 3 inches in New York and 4 to 6 inches in Boston.
""There is a projection now for certain parts of the city, particularly the more northern parts of the city of up to five to eight inches,"" New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio told reporters.
Heavier snow totals were expected in upstate New York, Pennsylvania, northwestern New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, southern Vermont, southern New Hampshire and Maine, with some areas already receiving a foot of snow, said meteorologist Bob Oravec of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.
""When it's all said and done, some areas will have over two feet of snow from this storm, especially over parts of the Poconos and Catskills,"" Oravec said of the mountain regions.
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy had said all non-essential workers should head home at noon due to weather conditions.
The storm that started on the West Coast ahead of Thanksgiving, the busiest U.S. travel holiday, slowly rolled across the entire country, drenching some areas with rain, blanketing others with snow and blasting still others with winds. Three tornadoes were reported northwest of Phoenix.
""It's uncommon to have a tornado in Phoenix, but it's not uncommon to have multiple types of weather with a big winter storm like that,"" Oravec said.
The storm was expected to linger in New York until just before sunrise on Tuesday, in Boston until early Tuesday afternoon and in Maine into Wednesday morning.
""There have been huge impacts from the storm since it occurred during the Thanksgiving week of travel and coming home from the holiday,"" Oravec said.
""It hit about possibly the worst time it could hit, and it went right across the entire country."""

Security Council warns countries to stop","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council called on all countries on Monday to implement an arms embargo on Libya and to stay out of the conflict after U.N. sanctions monitors accused Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey of repeated violations.
The 15-member council urged all states ""not to intervene in the conflict or to take measures that would exacerbate the conflict"" and expressed concern at ""the growing involvement of mercenaries."" Such statements are agreed by consensus.
The council ""called for full compliance with the arms embargo,"" but any action over reported sanctions violations is unlikely, diplomats said.
Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey have repeatedly violated an arms embargo on Libya and it is ""highly probable"" that a foreign attack aircraft is responsible for a deadly strike on a migrant detention center, U.N. experts monitoring the implementation of sanctions on Libya reported last month.
The U.N. missions of Jordan and Turkey did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment at the time on the accusations. The United Arab Emirates said it was ""firmly committed to complying with its obligations under the Libya sanctions regime and all relevant Security Council resolutions.""
""The transfers (of military material) to Libya were repeated and sometimes blatant with scant regard being paid to compliance with the sanctions measures,"" the independent U.N. experts wrote in the confidential report, due to be published this month.
Libya descended into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising that overthrew leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Thousands of people have been killed in sporadic fighting since 2014 between factions in the east and west. The violence has allowed militants and migrant smugglers to flourish, hit Libya's oil industry and divided the country's key institutions.
Earlier this year commander Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) launched an offensive against the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and its forces in Tripoli. But the war has reached an impasse.
The U.N. experts accuse Jordan and the United Arab Emirates of supplying military material to Haftar's forces, which they said then prompted Libya's Government of National Accord to ask Turkey for help.
Haftar is also backed by Egypt and more recently Russian mercenaries, according to diplomats and Tripoli officials. The LNA denies it has foreign backing. The United States has pushed Haftar to end his offensive."

An initial foreign agent law was adopted by Russia in 2012, giving authorities the power to label non-governmental organizations and human rights groups as foreign agents - a term that carries a negative Soviet-era connotations.
But the expansion of the definition of foreign agent to include private individuals now raises fresh concerns about the ability of independent journalists and bloggers to operate in the country. 
Several rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, had called for the initiative to be dropped as it was being approved by lawmakers.
Under the law, all material published by an individual who receives funds from abroad will be labeled as having been distributed by a foreign agent. The law also says that any individual who distributes foreign media could be labeled a foreign agent. 
Rights groups and other organizations designated by the Russian justice ministry as foreign agents can be subjected to spot checks and face bureaucratic scrutiny. 
Russian law also requires so-called foreign agents to submit regular reports on their funding, objectives, how they spend their money and who their managers are.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court justices debate whether to dismiss major gun case,"By Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court's consideration of a major gun rights case could end in a misfire, with the justices on Monday debating whether to dismiss a challenge backed by the powerful National Rifle Association to a New York City handgun ordinance.
The justices heard arguments in the first major gun dispute to come before them since 2010, with gun control advocates fearful that the court, with its 5-4 conservative majority, could issue a ruling further expanding firearms rights nationwide. 
Much of the arguments focused on whether the court should even decide the merits of the legal challenge because the city in July got rid of the limits imposed on licensed gun owners on where they could take their firearms that were central to the legal challenge.
The four liberal justices indicated support for declaring the case moot because New York amended the measure.
""What's left of this case?"" liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked. ""Petitioners have gotten all the relief they sought."" 
The city has ""thrown in the towel,"" added fellow liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
Three local handgun owners and the New York state affiliate of the NRA - a national gun rights lobby group closely aligned with President Donald Trump and other Republicans - argued that the regulation violated the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The Trump administration sided with the NRA-backed challengers.
Only three of the five conservative justices asked questions. Two of them - Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - were vocal in advocating for the court to issue a ruling. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, who could be a pivotal vote in the case, said little but his questions indicated he potentially could vote in favor of dismissing the case.
The regulation had prevented licensed owners from taking their handguns to other homes or shooting ranges outside the confines of the most-populous U.S. city. Conservative justices focused on an argument made by the plaintiffs' attorney Paul Clement that the city's amended regulation is still inadequate. 
The Supreme Court opted to proceed with the arguments even though the city had argued that the amendment made the matter moot. The court's ruling is due by the end of June. 
Hundreds of gun control supporters demonstrated outside the courthouse, calling gun violence a public health crisis. Gun control is a contentious issue in the United States, which has experienced a series of mass shootings. 
A ruling expanding firearms owners' rights could jeopardize hundreds of gun control laws passed in recent years by state and local governments, including expanded background checks and confiscations of weapons from individuals who a court has deemed dangerous, according to gun violence prevention advocates. Republican opposition in Congress has been instrumental in thwarting passage of new federal gun control laws. 
COFFEE BREAKS
The dispute centers on New York City's handgun ""premises"" licenses. Transport rules had been tightened in 2001 after New York police observed gun license holders improperly traveling with loaded firearms or with their firearms far from any authorized range. 
The challengers contend that the amended regulation is still deficient because it requires all handgun transport to be ""continuous and uninterrupted,"" potentially putting owners at legal risk if they take a coffee break en route. 
The city's attorney Richard Dearing said owners would not face consequences for coffee breaks or other ""reasonably necessary"" stops. That did not placate Gorsuch, who wondered what would qualify.
""Is coffee reasonably necessary?"" Gorsuch asked.
Alito wondered what would happen if a gun owner stops to visit his mother for a couple hours. 
Roberts asked whether the city residents who challenged the law would face negative consequences for violations of the prior regulation. Dearing said they would not. If Roberts' concerns are resolved by that answer, it could be a sign he would join the liberals in finding the case moot.
The Supreme Court had not taken up a major firearms case since 2010, when it extended to state and local regulations a 2008 ruling that recognized for the first time that the Second Amendment protects a person's right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.
Conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas asked no questions. Thomas is known as a strong gun rights supporter. Kavanaugh, as a member of a lower court, dissented in a 2011 ruling that upheld an assault-style weapon ban and other gun restrictions in the District of Columbia. 

The plaintiffs sued in 2013 after authorities told them they could not participate in a shooting competition in New Jersey or bring their guns to a home elsewhere in the state. The Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the regulation advanced the city's interest in protecting public safety and did not violate the Second Amendment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's re-election campaign said on Monday it will no longer issue press credentials to reporters working for Bloomberg News, the agency owned by Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg. 
The news agency said following Bloomberg's announcement of his presidential bid that it would no longer critically cover the Democratic presidential candidates - including Bloomberg and his rivals - but would go on covering Trump. 
Trump's re-election campaign made the announcement. It was not immediately clear whether the Trump White House would change how Bloomberg reporters are treated. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Credentials enable reporters to more easily access rallies and other campaign events leading up to the November 2020 election. Members of the public must obtain tickets from the campaign and then wait in long lines to enter events.
""Since they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events,"" Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. 
""We will determine whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis."" 
Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire media mogul who owns the eponymous news organization, announced on Nov. 24 that he would seek the Democratic nomination for president. Separately, he is spending $100 million of his own money on digital ads attacking Trump.
In response to the Trump campaign announcement, Bloomberg News quoted editor-in-chief John Micklethwait as saying, ""The accusation of bias couldn’t be further from the truth.
""We have covered Donald Trump fairly and in an unbiased way since he became a candidate in 2015 and will continue to do so despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign.""
After Bloomberg announced his White House candidacy, Micklethwait released a memo stating the news agency would ""continue our tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation) and will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.""

However, he said, the business-focused news organization would continue ""to investigate the Trump administration, the government of the day.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - A Belgian lawyer appeared in a Geneva court on Monday accused of money-laundering and falsifying documents in a case involving Belgium's richest family, who say she swindled missing shares in brewer InBev worth some $60 million today.
The woman, who denies the charges, was convicted in 2016 by a Luxembourg court for attempted fraud in a linked case involving the 2005 testament of the late heiress Amicie de Spoelberch, widow of Luka Bailo, but the missing shares were not found.
The couple's Geneva-based sons, Patrice and Alexis Bailo de Spoelberch, brought a fresh case, accusing her of being behind the disappearance of 815,000 bearer shares in InBrew, now InBev, from a Luxembourg bank in 2004.
""She already deceived the Luxembourg justice system, there is no way she is going to deceive Geneva too,"" prosecutor Niki Casonato told the court in opening remarks. Patrice Bailo attended the trial, while his brother was excused by a medical certificate invoking mental instability.
""Her criminal activity stretched over 10 years, with numerous transfers, opening and closing of accounts and setting up of offshore companies,"" Casanato said.
The prosecutor's indictment accuses the lawyer of depositing illicitly obtained shares at leading Geneva private banks and transferring funds to offshore companies, including in Singapore.
The 57-year-old defendant, who cannot be identified under Geneva tribunal rules, said that the funds were for her legal work for the Bailo de Spoelberch family. Her lawyers argued that she was unfairly being tried in the same case, but the tribunal said the charge of money-laundering was new.
She was sentenced in the 2016 Luxembourg case to 24 months in jail, with 15 months of the sentence suspended.
Arrested again while on her sailboat in 2017 in Greece, she was interned there in conditions she said were similar to the 1978 prison movie ""Midnight Express"", before agreeing to extradition to Geneva.
""This is the fourth time I am being attacked for a dossier in which I helped the Bailo brothers,"" she said.
She said that she ""confirmed the legitimacy of my own patrimony"", worth an estimated 25 million euros ($27.6 million)that has been confiscated.
The trial continues until Wednesday."

Opposition lawmakers walked out of parliament on Monday in protest at the delayed departure, hurling bundles of fake cash at the government benches as they quit the chamber. Outside the building, hundreds of protesters chanted ""Mafia, mafia"".
Speaking to a semi-empty house, Muscat appeared relaxed, joking at times as he justified the investigation, which he said was Malta's biggest ever. 
""The case showed that Malta's institutions work and everyone is equal before the law,"" he said. 
Fenech has denied being the mastermind and sought legal immunity in return for revealing information about the murder plot and about alleged corruption involving Muscat's former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi, among others, court filings showed.
The government has rejected his bid for a pardon.
Schembri and Mizzi both resigned last week and have denied wrongdoing. Schembri was questioned for two days by police following his resignation before being released without charge. 
Both men had been suing Caruana Galizia for libel over allegations she made about their business deals.
COURT PETITION
Critics are angry with Muscat for sticking by Schembri, and for including him in security briefings on the investigation even after Fenech was identified as a suspect in the murder and as an associate of Schembri.
""Muscat wants to manipulate the police investigation to save himself and his best friend Keith Schembri,"" opposition leader Adrian Delia told parliament. 
""This is unacceptable for the opposition. We are walking out and will not participate in proceedings for as long as Joseph Muscat remains prime minister.""
Caruana Galizia's family said Muscat should have no further involvement in the case and petitioned a court to ensure he was excluded from any further access to the information.
""It's completely intolerable and it's absolutely disgraceful that he's trying to hang on to power,"" Caruana Galizia's sister Corrine Vella told Reuters TV. 
Muscat said he would handle only the ""day-to-day"" government administration until a new leader was chosen.

""We now need unity. Part of that is shouldering responsibility, not just for one's own actions but also ... for possible shortcomings,"" he said.

DURRES, Albania (Reuters) - Residents of damaged buildings in Albania's second-biggest city of Durres are reluctant to return to their apartments until the government can tell them they are safe following last week's deadly earthquake.
In one apartment block, a Reuters team walked up a staircase clogged with bricks and plaster debris and saw walls that had been torn open or collapsed, revealing bathrooms and kitchens.
Bricks littered beds and one living-room was now open to the street.
A total of 51 people were killed in the quake that struck last Tuesday. After finding shelter for more than 6,300 homeless people in hotels, gyms, tents and social centers, the government now faces the task of assessing the safety of buildings and rebuilding homes.
Some 70 experts, 50 of them foreign, are working to assess the damage.
Living in relatives' houses and even cars, residents keep returning to their apartments to protect them from thieves or to cart away possessions as hundreds of aftershocks add to their fears and strain the buildings.
Robert Bushi, 61, said he had dragged his 20-year-old daughter Klea from her bed on which broken bricks had fallen, wounding her on the forehead.
His living room wall had fallen out. The 10-storey building was close to two hotels that collapsed and were being demolished on the Durres beach area.
""On TV they make it look like everything is taken care of but it is six days now were are out in the street and no one came to tell us if the building is safe,"" he told Reuters.
The 6.4-magnitude quake, Albania's worst ever, was centered 30 km west of the capital Tirana and was felt across the Balkans and southern Italy across the Adriatic Sea.
Alabania's last big quake, which killed 40 people, was in 1979 so people were ill-equipped to deal with it.
Some 3,822 dwellings and 461 apartment buildings had been heavily damaged, with 20 declared non-habitable.
Building structures with more storeys than licensed have long been as issue and the government has started to address it. People say that standards have not been rigorously applied during a building boom as people moved from rural areas into the cities, especially Tirana and Durres, in the past two decades.
Prime Minister Edi Rama, touring Durres, promised citizens that each apartment building would be checked for safety.
Hysni Ramollari, 70, who had gone to an apartment to switch off the water supply, said the door shut after the quake and he was rescued by a construction team.
""It was an act of God but right now it is on the government if they do not come and tell us if this building is safe,"" he said.
Like others, he had spent his savings to buy the place.
Naim Kolaveri, 60, said a smaller quake three hours after the main had damaged the 10-storey building and he feared another big one would doom it.
""The big quake kicked me around like a soccer ball,"" he told Reuters as he and his wife moved away a TV set and a heater.
""It feels as if the quake is in our blood now,"" said Bledi, 25, a barkeeper. ""I feel I shake whenever I move around."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The leak and distribution of classified British-U.S. trade documents online resembles a disinformation campaign uncovered this year that originated in Russia, according to experts who say it could signal foreign interference in Britain's election.
The opposition Labour Party said on Nov. 27 the classified documents, which first appeared online on Oct. 21, showed the ruling Conservatives were plotting to offer up the state-run National Health Service for sale in trade talks with Washington.
The NHS is much loved by Britons and has become an important issue in the Dec. 12 election, in which Labour trails the Conservatives despite cutting its lead in some opinion polls. 
Researchers at Britain's Oxford and Cardiff universities, the Atlantic Council thinktank and social media analytics firm Graphika said the way the documents were first shared online mirrored a campaign called Secondary Infektion.
Secondary Infektion, uncovered by the Atlantic Council in June, used fabricated or altered documents to try to spread false narratives across at least 30 online platforms, and stemmed from a network of social media accounts which Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said ""originated in Russia.""
""It's on the same set of websites (as Secondary Infektion), it's using the same types of accounts and making the same language errors. It's either the Russian operation or someone trying hard to look like it,"" said Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at Graphika.
Reuters has been unable to verify whether the documents are genuine. Labour and the British government declined immediate comment. In Washington, the U.S. Trade Representative did not respond to requests for comment.
It is not clear who was behind either operation and cyber experts say it is hard to attribute malicious actions online with certainty. 
Moscow has denied allegations of election meddling and the Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Whoever did this ... was absolutely trying to keep it a secret,"" said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. ""It carries the specter of foreign influence."" 
""SOWING CONFUSION""
A link to download documents with the same content and metadata as the documents released by Labour was first shared on Internet discussion site Reddit by a user who made language errors typical of non-native English speakers.
A person with the same username and profile picture copied the Reddit post to a website known for hosting conspiracy theories, and a Twitter account with the same name and profile picture then tweeted the link to journalists and politicians. 
Another account simultaneously shared links to the Reddit post on three German-language blogging websites.
The researchers interviewed by Reuters said the websites used to put the information online, Twitter activity and language errors all resembled the Secondary Infektion campaign.
Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher at Oxford University's Project on Computational Propaganda, said if Russia was behind the leak, its aim may not have been to help any particular side in the election.
""We know from the Russian playbook that often it is not for or against anything,"" she said. ""It's about sowing confusion, and destroying the field of political trust."" 
Reuters has been unable to establish how the Reddit user or Labour acquired the unredacted documents. The Reddit user did not respond to written questions and the Twitter account was suspended last week. 
A Reddit spokeswoman said: ""The integrity of our site is of paramount importance and we are investigating these findings.""

Twitter said it was unable to comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons but that it aggressively enforces its own rules barring ""spammy content"" on its service. Facebook declined comment.

Amid recent demonstrations in a number of countries in the region, Pompeo stepped up allegations that Cuba and Venezuela had helped stir up unrest but offered few specifics to back his comments.
Pompeo cited recent political protests in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador and said that Colombia had closed its border to Venezuela out of concern that protesters from the neighboring country would enter.
""We in the Trump administration will continue to support countries trying to prevent Cuba and Venezuela from hijacking those protests and we'll work with legitimate (governments) to prevent protests from morphing into riots and violence that don't reflect the democratic will of the people,"" Pompeo told an audience at the University of Louisville, in Kentucky.
U.S. relations with communist-ruled Havana have deteriorated since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. His administration has steadily rolled back parts of the historic opening under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
The tension has focused especially on Havana's support for Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse and stands accused by the United States of corruption and human rights violations. 
The United States and more than 50 other countries have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate president. Guaido invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency in January, arguing Maduro’s 2018 re-election was a sham. 
But Maduro retains the support of the military, runs the government’s day-to-day operations and is backed by Russia, China and Cuba.
In his speech on Monday, Pompeo said Maduro was ""hanging on"" and would continue to work to suppress the Venezuelan people, but that he was confident the Venezuelan president's leadership would end.
""The end will come for Maduro as well. We just don't know what day,"" Pompeo said.

WINDHOEK (Reuters) - Two former ministers and four others implicated in Namibia's biggest corruption scandal will remain in police custody until Feb. 20 after their lawyers abandoned their bail application on Monday, the prosecuting authority said.
Former justice minister Sakeus Shanghala and fisheries minister Bernardt Esau, along with two former employees of South Africa's Investec, are accused of conspiring with Iceland's biggest fishing company Samherji to receive payments worth millions of dollars in exchange for fishing quotas.
Their lawyers declined to comment on the reason for their decision. Samherji has denied wrongdoing, as have Esau and Shanghala.
The fishing scandal involves allegations the former ministers, who quit last month when media reports of corruption surfaced, took bribes in return for awarding horse mackerel quotas to Samherji.
The charges state that the accused solicited, accepted or agreed to accept 100 million Namibian dollars ($6.8 million) from Samherji's Namibian subsidiaries from 2014-19 to secure fishing quotas.
Esau is also charged with awarding a quota for up to 55,000 tonnes of horse mackerel quotas to a private Namibian company, Namgomar Pesca, in exchange for bribes. Its director, Ricardo Gustavo, is Investec Namibia's former clients director and one of the men on trial.
South Africa's Investec told Reuters last month that Gustavo and the other former employee facing charges, James Hatuikulipi, had left the bank, that it had no connection to the case and that its former employees had not used their Investec positions to facilitate the alleged scheme in any way.
The scandal has shocked Namibians. Protesters gathered outside the magistrates court in Windhoek, chanting for the men not to be released on bail.

The teachers will receive a gradual increase in salaries, totaling 6.11% by the start of 2021 on the basis of an improved job definition to address pay differentials with other public sector roles.
""We have made a good compromise, by which we have achieved what we wanted from the beginning. The compromise consists of the payment dynamics,"" said Branimir Mihalinec, head of the secondary school teachers' union.
The deal comes against the backdrop of fiscal responsibility adopted by the conservative-led government as part of efforts to preserve Croatia's recently regained investment credit rating and to join the euro currency zone in coming years.
Teachers' salaries will rise by 3% with effect from Dec. 1, with a further 1% from mid-2020 and another 2% from Jan. 1, 2021.
School classes will restart across the country from Tuesday.
In October the government said it would increase wages for all public sector employees by 6.12% in 2020.
Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said after Monday's talks that the teachers' pay deal would not threaten efforts to sustain a balanced budget."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An indictment submitted to Israel's parliament on Monday against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu names more than 300 prosecution witnesses, including wealthy friends and former aides, in three graft cases against him.
By formally sending the indictment to the legislature, after announcing charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud on Nov. 21, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit set the clock ticking on a 30-day period in which Netanyahu can seek parliamentary immunity from prosecution.
Such protection seems unlikely, with Israeli politics in disarray after inconclusive elections in April and September and the failure of Netanyahu and his main challenger, Benny Gantz, to secure a ruling majority in the legislature.
Netanyahu, in office for the past decade, has denied any wrongdoing, saying he is a victim of an attempted ""coup"" waged by legal authorities trying to unseat a popular right-wing leader.
As prime minister, he is under no legal obligation to resign after being charged. No date has been set for the opening of the trial, with three judges presiding in Jerusalem District Court.
The indictment submitted to parliament listed 333 witnesses for the prosecution. Legal experts said the long roster meant proceedings could go on for years.
They include U.S. casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam, Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, Australian billionaire James Packer and retired Israeli security chiefs, and several former aides who will be state witnesses against him.
Netanyahu poured scorn on the length of the witness list.
""When an accusation is true, you don't need 333 witnesses,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""When the accusation is untrue, not even 333 witnesses will help.""
TALKS DEADLOCKED
In one case, Netanyahu is suspected of wrongfully requesting and accepting expensive gifts, including champagne and cigars, from Milchan and Packer. Neither has been charged with any wrongdoing.
Another case focuses on allegations that Netanyahu promised the owner of Israel's best-selling newspaper to push for regulations on its main competitor, owned by Adelson.
Netanyahu also is accused of granting regulatory favors worth about 1.8 billion shekels ($500 million) to Bezeq Telecom Israel (TA:BEZQ) in return for positive coverage on a website owned by its former chairman.
Talks between Netanyahu's Likud and Gantz's centrist Blue and White party on a ""national unity"" government are deadlocked.
If no agreement is reached within 10 days - the end of a three-week period in which legislators can nominate a candidate to try to form a government - Israel is likely to hold a new election.

Ivanovic was gunned down in front of his party office in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica, in an area mainly inhabited by Kosovo's Serb minority.
The prosecution said three suspects were already in custody and international arrest warrants were issued for three others, including the two who allegedly ordered the killing.
The defendants include a woman who worked as an administrator in Ivanovic's office who is accused of helping the killers and police officers accused of hiding evidence, according to the prosecution.
In its statement, the prosecutor's office did not reveal ethnicity of those indicted, but a local prosecutor who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said all those indicted were Serbs.
More than a decade since Kosovo proclaimed independence, around 40,000 to 50,000 Serbs in northern Kosovo refuse to recognize Pristina institutions and see Belgrade as their capital.
Relations between Serbia and Kosovo remain strained, as Belgrade refuses to recognize the independence of its former province and, with its ally Russia, is blocking Kosovo's membership in the United Nations."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's governing Conservative Party has ramped up its campaigning efforts on social media platform Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with a surge of ads highlighting policy areas to younger voters.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have raised record campaign funds before the Dec. 12 election, but until this point have spent comparatively little on Facebook advertising.
A Facebook report of advertisements run in the seven days to Nov. 30 showed just 201 Conservative adverts were in the platform's Ad Library, with the party spending thousands of pounds less than the Liberal Democrats, Labour or Brexit Party in that time.
However, on Monday there were 910 Conservative ads listed as having been ""active"" over the last day, with most seen mainly by voters in the 25-34 age bracket.
The party had spent 37,653 pounds ($48,310) on Facebook ads in the week up to Nov. 30, but details of how much it spent since Saturday were not immediately available.
The adverts focus on ending uncertainty around Brexit, investment in the health service and ads attacking the spending plans of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The 230 active ads run by Labour over the last week focused on the party's plans for a green ""industrial revolution"" and its tax proposals.
Johnson and minister Michael Gove headed up the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum of 2016, and the group's campaign director Dominic Cummings - who has been a key Johnson adviser during his premiership - has spoken of the major role a late surge in online advertising played in that campaign.
Online political adverts currently do not require labeling to say who has paid for them, leading to criticism from Britain's Electoral Commission that the rules are not fit for purpose.
Vote Leave was fined by the regulator for breaking spending limits during the campaign, and the Canadian data firm it worked with on Facebook adverts also broke privacy laws, the report of an official probe into the matter found last week."

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling parties are on a collision course over a proposal to relax time limits on the prosecution of crimes, threatening the future of the fractious, three-month old government.
Italy has long been dogged by a dysfunctional, painfully slow justice system, but the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party (PD) have differing ideas on how to fix it -- and neither seems willing to back down.
5-Star, for whom the fight against corruption has always been a clarion call, says much of the blame lies with the so-called statute of limitations, which wipes out trials if a verdict is not reached within a set limit.
The party's Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede has proposed scrapping the statute of limitations rule after an initial verdict, allowing the appeals process to take place without time limits.
The changes are due to kick in from January, but the PD opposes the reform, saying defendants would face years of legal uncertainty while their trials continue interminably.
Bonafede warned last week it would be ""a grave matter"" if the PD were to join forces with the opposition parties, including Matteo Salvini's far-right League, to vote down the reform in parliament.
He did not reply when asked by Reuters on Monday whether, in such an event, 5-Star would bring down the government.
""If there is no political agreement (on a broader reform), we won't let the statute of limitations changes through,"" said Alfredo Bazoli, PD leader in the lower house justice committee.
Italy's ruling parties are already split on areas from euro zone reform to migrant rights. Some political analysts forecast the government could fall within months and justice could be the issue that tips it over the edge.
Unlike other major Western countries, the legal clock in Italy starts when a crime is committed and keeps ticking until the statute of limitations becomes effective, making the trial null and void.
In 2018, 117,367 proceedings ended before reaching a verdict, justice ministry data shows, with the vast majority involving white-collar crime.
However, 75% of these reached the time limit before a first verdict was issued, meaning Bonafede's reform would have only a limited effect on preventing trials being annulled.
The need to speed up the justice system is indisputable. From 1958 to 2018, the European Court of Human Rights has condemned Italy 1,194 times for excessive length of trial proceedings, more than any other European country."

One of Turkey's best known politicians, Selahattin Demirtas has been in jail for more than three years on several charges including terrorism. He could be sentenced to 142 years in jail if found guilty in the main case.
Aygul Demirtas, his sister and one of his lawyers, said earlier that Demirtas had not been taken to the hospital despite losing consciousness on Nov. 26 after experiencing chest pains and trouble breathing.
His Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), the second largest opposition party in Turkey's parliament, said shortly after that Demirtas was taken to hospital after two of its lawmakers visited Demirtas in prison.
The chief prosecutor in the western province of Edirne, where Demirtas is being held, said initial tests last week had indicated no health issues. It said appointments were made at a hospital to conduct detailed tests, and Demirtas had been transferred to the hospital on Monday.
Demirtas, 46, had remained unconscious for a long time after fainting on the morning of Nov. 26, lawyer Demirtas said on Twitter. 
An electrocardiogram was carried out on Demirtas but the prison doctor asked that he be taken to hospital for examination by cardiology, neurology and gastroenterology experts, she said.
In September, prosecutors in Ankara launched a new investigation into Demirtas and requested his detention after a court lifted his arrest warrant in the main case. Demirtas denies the charges against him.

Ankara accuses the HDP of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long armed struggle against the Turkish state. The HDP denies links to terrorism.

Syria's northwestern corner, including the Idlib region, is the last major chunk of territory still in rebel hands after more than eight years of war.
The air strikes hit a fruit and vegetable market in Maaret al-Numan, south of Idlib, and a second produce market in Saraqib to the east, according to the White Helmets, a civil defense and rescue group operating in rebel areas of Syria.
Photos and videos posted by the group on Twitter showed victims being carried away from demolished produce stands and charred vehicles.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met an envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday to discuss the situation in Idlib and attacks launched by militant groups based there, according to a tweet from Syria's presidency.
There was no mention of the air strikes on Syrian state media.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, put the number of those killed in the attack at 15.
It said separately that Russian air strikes had targeted a prison in Idlib, causing casualties and prisoners to flee. It did not provide specific figures.
Russia, which has supported Assad against rebels and militants in his country's civil war, and Turkey, long a backer of rebels, co-sponsored a ""de-escalation"" of conflict agreement for the area earlier this year that has since faltered.

Ten days before Britain's national election, support for the Conservatives stood at 42%, up one point from ICM's last poll a week ago. The Labour Party was also up one point at 35%.
The pro-European Union Liberal Democrats were unchanged on 13% while the Brexit Party was down one point on 3%.
ICM surveyed 2,029 adults online between Nov. 29 and Dec 2.
Three polls published on Saturday showed a narrowing of the Conservatives' lead over Labour while one showed it had widened and another said it was unchanged.
Friday's attack, in which a convicted terrorist who was released early from prison killed two people before being shot by police, has become a campaign issue.
Johnson is promising a tougher stance on the release of prisoners and has accused Labour's leader Jeremy Corbyn of being soft on terrorism. Labour says spending cuts under a decade of Conservative-led governments have made it harder to fight militancy and reintegrate prisoners.
ICM's poll on Monday found three in 10 people thought the Conservatives would win power with a majority of less than 50 seats in parliament and one in five thought the majority would be more than that. 
Nearly a quarter of people thought a hung parliament, with no outright majority for any party, was the most likely outcome. Only one in 10 expected Labour to win a majority.

Since the election, Thanathorn was suspended from parliament and was found guilty last month of breaching election law by holding shares in a media company on the date his candidacy was registered for the election.
He said the case against him showed a concerted effort by the Thai establishment to undermine the opposition and its critics. Thanathorn and the Future Forward party are facing dozens of legal cases.
""We want to participate in politics inside of the parliamentary system but we are not allowed to do this, so we are being pushed outside,"" he said.

His release has been demanded by the European Union, which is currently considering whether to remove lucrative trade privileges from Cambodia over its crackdown on the opposition, activists and the media.
Kem Sokha's daughter said the decision to put Kem Sokha on trial showed bad faith from the ruling Cambodian People's Party at a time when the EU trade privileges were at risk and measures were also under consideration in the U.S. Congress.
""This attitude from the regime is not helping,"" Monovithya Kem told Reuters.
Kem Sokha has said the charges against him were nonsense.
The only evidence presented against him in public so far is comment he made at a public meeting in which he said he was getting advice from unspecified Americans on election strategy ahead of a 2013 ballot."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Protests over the alleged rape and murder of a 27-year-old veterinary doctor spread to cities across India on Monday as people demanded tough and swift punishments, including public lynchings, to stop crimes against women.
The woman was raped, asphyxiated and her dead body then set alight on Nov 27 on the outskirts of the southern city of Hyderabad, according to police. Four men aged between 20 and 28 years have been arrested in connection with the crime.
Protesters and lawmakers said they wanted authorities to ensure that rape cases were speedily processed and those convicted punished instantly, similar to demands that were raised after the fatal gang rape of a young woman in New Delhi in 2012 that had caused outrage and international condemnation.
In the eastern city of Kolkata, where protests were planned throughout the day, college student Bandana Mondal said it was becoming difficult to sit back and watch silently.
""It is time to hit the road and seek faster punishment for the offenders. The process of law appears slow and there is hardly any deterrent,"" she said.
Indian police registered more than 32,500 cases of rape in 2017, according to government data. But tens of thousands of such cases remain stuck in courts, often hindering victims and their families as they navigate the slow and cumbersome legal system.
In 2017, for example, courts only disposed off about 18,300 cases related to rape and more than 127,800 such cases remained pending at the end of the year.
""It's very frustrating for the victim. You keep on going to court, and even after evidence is over, they take a long time to pass the judgment,"" women's rights lawyer Flavia Agnes told Reuters.
But in a sign of the volatile public mood, a lawmaker in India's upper house suggested that rapists should be strung up before a mob. 
""I know it's a little harsh, but I think these kind of people need to be brought in public and lynched,"" said Jaya Bachchan. 
In Hyderabad, which has seen the largest of the protests, student activists linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party also asked for capital punishment.
""We demand the culprits be hung in public,"" said Sirisha, who only gave one name.
At a protest in New Delhi, 19-year-old college student Aditi Purohit said that she was so angry and frustrated that she had left her classes and come out.

""If they (the accused) were in front of me, I would have killed them,"" she said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Brazil's negotiators already face a tough job at United Nations climate talks, given anger at President Jair Bolsonaro's stance on the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but it has become doubly difficult as they are in the dark on their own government's aims.
The right-wing leader has become a target for environmental lobbyists since Amazon destruction surged to an 11-year high and terrible fires raged in August, with Bolsonaro's policies encouraging deforesters and cowing environmental enforcers.
Yet as if that was not enough, Brazil's technical negotiators at the United Nations talks in Spain on Monday are disconnected from political leaders and unclear on their goals, two people familiar with the matter said.
That means the negotiators could reach a deal that would be disavowed by government leaders. ""Really what Brazil will do at the conference is anybody's guess,"" one of the sources told Reuters.
Adding to the confusion, Bolsonaro loyalist and Environment Minister Ricardo Salles has turned up in Madrid a week early to attend the full, two-week conference rather than just the second stage with fellow ministers from other nations.
""Only he knows what he's doing there,"" another source said.
As home to most of the vast Amazon rainforest that serves as a bulwark against global warming, Brazil is always a major player at environmental talks and has often been a broker between developed and developing nations.
But its widely-publicized backsliding on domestic protections has changed that, and Brazil's official delegation in Madrid no longer includes environmental lobby groups whose credentials it traditionally sponsored.
Once swelled by activists, Brazil's delegation now has government officials only, according to two Brazilian former attendees who are participating in this year's event but under different credentials.
FAR CRY FROM '92 RIO SUMMIT
At a technical level, Brazil's negotiating position remains unchanged, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. In particular, it will keep pressing for stricter accounting for carbon trading and wants emissions credits from an earlier climate accord to be honored under the Paris pact.
At the political level there is uncertainty, though Salles has indicated he will be pushing to see how much Brazil will get of a planned $100 billion in annual environmental financing that developed countries promised developing countries by 2020.
Brazil's Environment Ministry and Bolsonaro's office did not respond to requests for comment about the Spain summit.
But at the U.N. General Assembly this year, Bolsonaro accused media of demonizing him and sensationalizing Amazon fires, saying Brazil had one of the best environmental records and used only 8 pct of its territory for agriculture.
However, he also outraged many by denying the Amazon was the ""lungs of the world"" and accusing non-governmental organizations of wanting to block development and ""keep our indigenous people like cavemen.""
Salles has taken heat too for weakening Brazil's environmental enforcement agency, questioning official deforestation data and sparring with lobby groups.
The minister says Brazil has already met most of its Paris commitment to cut emissions by 37% in 2025 compared to 2005 levels. Environmental groups say while that may be true based on government statistics available only to 2015, recent changes have Brazil on track to miss that goal.
Researchers blame heightened Amazon destruction on a new wave of land speculators, farmers and ranchers clearing land at a faster rate since Bolsonaro was elected last October.
It is a far cry from when Brazil hosted the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, laying the foundation for the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement seeking to limit average temperature rises to within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
""They used to be seen as a leader,"" said Alden Meyer, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists advocacy group. ""That obviously has changed."""

The soldiers died when their helicopters collided in the dark as they hunted Islamist militants. It was the biggest loss of French troops in a single day since an attack in Beirut 36 years ago when 58 soldiers died.
The deaths in Mali highlight the human cost to France of leading a six-year counter-insurgency campaign in West Africa. It has forced France to reassess its strategy, with no prospect in the immediate term of withdrawing its 4,500 troops from the region.
Escorted by police motorcyclists and with soldiers from the military regiments saluting their fallen comrades along the Alexandre III bridge, the 13 hearses solemnly crossed toward the Hotel des Invalides, where President Emmanuel Macron will lead tributes at a funeral ceremony later in the day.
The bodies of the fallen soldiers returned home on Sunday after a military homage at their base in Gao, central Mali.
""What is at stake in the Sahel is the security of France,"" Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer told RTL radio ahead of a homage, referring to the desert region of western Africa south of the Sahara desert that includes Mali. 
France, the former colonial power in the region, is the only Western country with a significant military presence waging counter-insurgency operations in Mali and the wider Sahel region.
Fifty-eight percent of French people back the country's military operations in Mali, an IFOP poll for L'Expansion showed on Monday.
Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita (IBK) faced criticism at home on Monday for heading to Paris after not attending a ceremony for the death of 30 Malian soldiers in Gao last month. 
""I bow to their memory,"" IBK said defending his decision to go to Paris in a national address on Sunday night. ""We have no reason to bite the hand (of help) of those who offer theirs today."" 
Critical voices in the region have increasingly scorned Paris for failing to restore stability and anti-French sentiment has grown.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 06:46AM ET</span>","Eleven North Korean defectors detained in Vietnam, seek to block deportation: activists","By Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - Eleven North Koreans seeking to defect to South Korea have been detained in Vietnam since Nov. 23 and are seeking help to avoid being repatriated, a South Korean activist group said on Monday. 
The eight women and three men were detained by border guards in northern Vietnam two days after crossing from China, and are being held in the city of Lang Son, the Seoul-based Justice for North Korea said in a statement. 
Peter Jung, the head of the group, which supports North Korean asylum-seekers, said the would-be defectors had requested help from the South Korean Embassy in Hanoi, but he had not heard from them since Friday.
Jung said the Seoul embassy's subsequent silence had spurred him to publicize the situation, fearing that without an international response the defectors could be forcibly repatriated.
He said that on Thursday Vietnamese authorities called off an effort to deport the defectors after several of them protested passionately and appeared to faint.
Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The South Korean foreign Ministry said it was aware of the case and had been in touch with the Vietnamese government to try to prevent the defectors from being sent back to North Korea.
""Our government has been making necessary efforts to ensure the North Korean defectors living abroad are sent to a desired place without being forcibly repatriated,"" the ministry said in a statement.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been trying to make diplomatic progress with North Korea, and his government has been criticized by groups like Jung's for not doing enough to help defectors in recent months.
Last month South Korea expelled two North Korean fishermen suspected of killing 16 colleagues before crossing the border into the South, after detaining them for questioning.
That decision drew criticism and dismay from some defectors, who said the men should have been tried in the South and would likely face torture, and possibly execution in North Korea.
As of September, at least 771 North Korean defectors had entered South Korea this year, according to the South's Unification Ministry, which handles relations with the North.
Around 33,000 North Korean defectors live in South Korea.

LONDON (Reuters) - Laws governing the upcoming British election are not fit for purpose and steps by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to increase transparency around digital adverts are not a substitute for reform, the Electoral Commission said.
The regulator has called for more powers to ensure online campaign material is clearly labeled, prohibit spending by foreign organizations and increase the amount it can levy as a maximum fine to those who break the rules.
But promised legislation has not materialized ahead of the Dec. 12 election.     
""We think electoral law needs to be reformed. That hasn't happened, so we are continuing to run this election with laws that aren't fit for purpose,"" Louise Edwards, director of regulation at the Electoral Commission, told Reuters.
""There are definitely going to be things that we would rather see done differently, better and more transparently for the voter that won't be, because the law hasn't been updated.""
In May the government pledged to safeguard elections through new legislation, including a requirement for a digital imprint on election material. But the government's proposals have yet to become law.    
Pressure on social media platforms over their handling of political advertising is mounting ahead of the U.S. presidential election in 2020, and Facebook has stood by its policy to allow political ads, even as rival Twitter has banned them.
To improve transparency, Facebook and Google have introduced databases which allow users to see who has spent on which political adverts. However, the Electoral Commission doesn't believe that such steps remove the need for legal reform.
""We should have legislation in place, and not rely on individual company policies, because those individual company policies are not the same of what the legal definition (of political advertising) is,"" Edwards said.
As an example, anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain has placed adverts on Google for a tactical voting website which advises who people should vote for to keep out their local Conservative candidate.
This is considered political advertising under British law and appears in Facebook's ad library, but Google has not included it in its database, as it does not promote the election of one specific candidate or party.
""Our focus for the upcoming election is transparency to show voters who is purchasing election ads about candidates and political parties,"" a Google spokesman said. 
""We remain committed to different approaches to improve transparency around ads, including so-called issue ads, and will have more to share in the future.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of office workers in Hong Kong's business district gathered on Monday for the first in a week of lunchtime protests backing the pro-democracy movement after its resounding victory in district polls last month in the Chinese-ruled city.
A day earlier police again fired tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters as they marched past the city's Kowloon waterfront, after first going to the U.S. consulate on Hong Kong island to show gratitude for Washington's support.
There was no such confrontation at the two-hour rally in the central business district on Monday, as some people went back to their offices after their demonstration of solidarity. Others said they would be striking for the full five days.
The gathering in Chater Garden probably drew Hong Kong's best-dressed protesters, and organizers have called on them to come out every day this week.
Protests over the last six months have drawn a wide swathe of Hong Kong society - from students to pensioners. Even white-collar professionals, like those in Chater park, have sometimes blocked roads in recent weeks, leading to face-offs with police.
Monday's rally appeared aimed specifically at bringing in more workers from advertising agencies to help build publicity.
Fred, a 24-year-old advertising professional, said he and his colleagues had helped create promotional materials in their own time for the so-called ""yellow economy"", the businesses seen as supporting the pro-democracy movement.
Many pro-democracy protesters have adopted the color yellow and yellow balloons have been seen at rallies.
""From the advertising perspective, we can help promote the brands that speak out for Hong Kong,"" said Fred.
Another protester in the park said his advertising agency had closed for the week in solidarity, and hoped other agencies would do likewise.
""We are trying to come out and be the first industry to come out and stop working for five days,"" said 28-year-old Ryan. 
""We are just stopping work for companies. But the advertising talent will keep advertising for the movement, designing posters and leaflets.""
TEAR GAS
During Sunday's protest police fired tear gas to disperse thousands of anti-government protesters, some of whom chanted ""revolution of our time"" and ""liberate Hong Kong"". That followed a period of relative calm after Nov. 24 district elections delivered an overwhelming victory to pro-democracy candidates. 
Police on Sunday used tear gas after protesters threw bricks and glass bottles, and ignored warnings, Kwok Ka-chuen, a senior police official, told a news conference.
Fity-eight people were arrested over the weekend, bring the total number of arrests since early June to 5,947, police said. 
The protest in the busy shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui followed a ""Thanksgiving"" march by hundreds to the U.S. consulate.
The protesters' demands include an end to Beijing's alleged meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, universal suffrage and an inquiry into police use of force.

The unrest since June has at times forced the closure of government offices, businesses, schools and the international airport, helping drive the city into recession for the first time in a decade in the third quarter.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will on Monday honor the two people who were killed when a militant knife man went on a stabbing spree near London Bridge in an attack that has thrust criminal justice to the center of the election campaign.
Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were killed on Friday when Usman Khan, a man convicted of terrorism offences in 2012, went on the rampage with kitchen knives at a prisoner rehabilitation conference beside London Bridge.
Confronted by bystanders, including a Polish man brandishing a narwhal tusk and others with fire extinguishers, Khan, who was wearing a fake suicide vest, was wrestled to the ground. He was then shot dead by British police.
A vigil in Guildhall Yard, in the heart of the City of London, will be held to honor the dead, those injured, the emergency services and the members of the public who tackled Khan.
With less than two weeks to go until the Dec. 12 snap election, British politicians sought to apportion blame for the early release of Khan - who was released despite a warning from the sentencing judge in 2012 that he was a danger to the public.
""I absolutely deplore the fact that this man was out on the street, I think it was absolutely repulsive and we are going to take action,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday.
Johnson's Conservatives have championed tough police and prison measures, but opponents have criticized them for overseeing almost a decade of cuts to public services.
BLAME GAME
Conservative cuts to community policing, probation, mental health, youth and social services could ""lead to missed chances to intervene in the lives of people who go on to commit inexcusable acts,"" said Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Corbyn, a veteran peace campaigner, also said convicted terrorists should not necessarily serve their full prison terms.
Amid the political and media rhetoric, the father of one of the dead called on the media and politicians not to use his son's death to justify division or hatred.
""Don’t use my son’s death, and his and his colleague’s photos - to promote your vile propaganda,"" David Merritt said in a tweet above newspaper headlines from the Daily Mail and Daily Express, both of which described a government plan for a ""blitz on freed jihadis"".
""Jack stood against everything you stand for - hatred, division, ignorance,"" he said.
Both the dead were involved in the University of Cambridge's Learning Together program to help educate and rehabilitate prisoners. Khan was attending a Learning Together event when he began his attack.
Sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison in 2012 with a requirement that the parole board assess his danger to the public before release, he was set free in December 2018 - without a parole board assessment.

WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The small Pacific island nation of Samoa has closed schools and is restricting travel ahead of the Christmas holiday season as the death toll from a measles outbreak tops 50, in the latest flare-up of a global epidemic of the virus.
The highly infectious disease has been crossing the globe, recently finding a susceptible population in Samoa, where vaccine coverage was only about 31% when measles took hold, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
In just over two weeks, the official death toll has jumped more than ten-fold to 53 on Monday, the Samoan government said. There are now more than 3,700 cases of measles recorded in the islands' deeply religious population of around 200,000.
""All our schools are closed, national exams have been postponed,"" Reverend Vavatau Taufao, general secretary of the Congregation Christian Church in Samoa, told Reuters.
""We are still having church services but if it gets worse we will have to stop church altogether - and it's almost Christmas.""
The vast majority of deaths were of children, with 48 out of the 53 aged four or under dying from the disease, according to a government update.
Measles cases are rising worldwide, even in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, as parents shun immunization for philosophical or religious reasons, or fears, debunked by doctors, that such vaccines could cause autism.
Other nations, through either poverty or poor planning, have let immunization levels slip, exposing their youngest members to a disease that aggressively attacks the immune system.
WHO warned in October of a devastating comeback in measles epidemics as the number of reported cases rose by 300 percent in the first three months of this year.
Reported measles cases are the highest they have been in any year since 2006, WHO said.
PACIFIC ROUTE
After causing devastation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine, among others, measles cases started appearing en masse earlier this year in the New Zealand city of Auckland, a hub for travel to and from small Pacific islands.
Dr Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland, said there were pockets of the community where immunization rates had slipped, allowing the disease to take hold.
""It's about being a good global citizen really, in that we all have to do our bit,"" said Petousis-Harris.
""I don't think that the response here has been a shining example. Because first of all we were aware of the possibility or the potential for this and that’s been the case for a long time.""
Samoan authorities have blamed low coverage rates in Samoa in part on fears caused last year when two babies died after receiving vaccinations shots, according to local media reports.
The country's immunization program was also temporarily suspended. The deaths were later found to have been caused by medications that were wrongly mixed.
Samoa has been racing to administer vaccines to children since declaring a state of emergency on Nov. 20 and has vaccinated 58,150 people so far, the government said on Monday.
Infection rates and deaths are still, however, climbing quickly with five fatalities in the past 24 hours, according to government data, prompting emergency restrictions on public gatherings and travel leading up to Christmas.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters they were sending additional vaccines and dozens of medical professionals to Samoa to help with the outbreak.
The government in Tonga attributed a recent outbreak of measles in the small Pacific island community to a squad of rugby players returning from New Zealand, although higher vaccination rates in Tonga - and in neighboring Fiji - have helped stem the outbreak."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Clashes sparked by suspected cartel gunmen in a northern Mexican town killed 20 people this weekend, authorities said, putting more pressure on Mexico's president to curb gang violence after the United States vowed to label the gangs terrorists.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, mindful of efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to designate Mexican drug gangs as terrorist groups, repeated on Sunday that he would not accept any intervention from abroad, while doubling down on his strategy of trying to contain the cartels. 
But the killings clouded celebrations marking Lopez Obrador's first year in office, which were buffeted by a march in Mexico City by thousands of people protesting the violence. 
The government of the northern state of Coahuila said local security forces killed 14 gunmen on Saturday and Sunday, after a major gunfight broke out in the small town of Villa Union near the Texas border. Earlier, the state government had said police had shot dead 17 cartel members.
Four police were also killed in the shootouts, which broke out around midday on Saturday, sparking fresh criticism of the government's approach to handling the powerful gangs.
The bodies of two unarmed civilians apparently murdered by the gunmen were also recovered, the government said.
Riding into town in a convoy of heavily armed pickups, gunmen sprayed the offices of the mayor of Villa Union with bullets and fought police for more than 1 1/2 hours as gunfire echoed through the streets.
More than 60 gunmen took part in the fight and 17 of their vehicles were seized, Coahuila's government said.
A number of the gunmen, who were suspected members of the Cartel of the Northeast from Tamaulipas state, were killed by state police in pursuit of the raiding party after it fled the town, authorities said.
The events in Villa Union add to a series of recent security lapses that have raised questions about Lopez Obrador's policy.
During a speech in front of tens of thousands of supporters on his first anniversary as president, Lopez Obrador again said Mexico would handle its security problems, after Trump's comments.
""We won't accept any kind of intervention, we're a sovereign, free country,"" the veteran leftist said in Mexico City's Zocalo central square.
Trump's remarks have stirred concerns in Mexico that Washington could try to take unilateral action to crush the drug cartels. U.S. Attorney General William Barr is due to visit the country next week to discuss cooperation on security.
Criticism at home and abroad has focused on the Nov. 4 massacre by suspected cartel gunmen of nine women and children of U.S.-Mexican origin from Mormon communities in northern Mexico, and the armed forces' release of a captured son of drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman under threats from his gang in the city of Culiacan.
Critics accuse Lopez Obrador of caving in to the cartels, but he defended the release of Ovidio Guzman, saying it had prevented unnecessary bloodshed.
""Our adversaries can say we showed weakness, but nothing is more important than people's lives,"" he said.
The protest march united opposition politicians with grieving members of the U.S.-Mexican LeBaron family, who lost loved ones in the killings in the state of Sonora. 
""We're not against the president, we're against the security policies that have been used until now, because they haven't worked,"" said Julian LeBaron, a relative of the victims.
Overnight, law enforcement agents captured several people suspected of involvement in those murders, the attorney general's office of Sonora said.
Homicides reached record levels in Mexico last year and are on track to surpass that total this year.
Lopez Obrador has also presided over a slowdown in the economy, which has stagnated in 2019.

Yet while there has been some erosion of support for him, most recent opinion polls show he remains popular.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2019 07:26PM ET</span>",Venezuelan opposition to investigate report of wrongdoing by lawmakers,"By Brian Ellsworth and Vivian Sequera
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition on Sunday vowed to investigate alleged wrongdoing within its ranks after a media outlet reported that a group of opposition lawmakers had unduly advocated for a businessman linked to the government of President Nicolas Maduro. 
Opposition leader and congress chief Juan Guaido said the legislature would probe the incident, which according to website Armando.info involved nine legislators from the First Justice, Popular Will and A New Time parties. 
The scandal comes as opposition efforts to oust Maduro lose steam and Guaido, who has been recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate leader, struggles to launch a new wave of street protests.
""(It is) unacceptable to use a state institution to attempt to whitewash the reputation of thieves and corrupt individuals who have looted Venezuela,"" said Guaido, pounding a lectern as he read from notes during a press conference.
According to the Armando.info report, the lawmakers were involved in writing letters of support for a Colombian national, Carlos Lizcano, despite evidence of his ties to Alex Saab, another Colombian man who is under U.S. sanction for corruption associated with Maduro's state-backed food distribution program.
It was not immediately evident if or how the legislators broke the law. 
Guaido said he suspected the legislators received illicit payments in exchange for writing the letters, but that this would be investigated.
The letters were addressed to the U.S. Treasury and Colombia's public prosecutor's office, according to the report. 
Neither institution responded to requests for comment. 
First Justice, Popular Will and A New Time on Sunday issued statements deploring the alleged corruption and promising to remove the lawmakers from the legislative comptroller commission, which focuses on fighting corruption.
""There is a smear campaign against us and some of our fellow legislators in the Venezuelan parliament,"" Luis Parra, who was placed under investigation by First Justice, wrote on Twitter, insisting he had been a victim of ""extortion.""
Freddy Superlano of Popular Will, in a letter to Guaido dated Saturday that he posted on Twitter, denied wrongdoing but said that while the investigation proceeded he was stepping down from his role as president of the comptroller commission.
Reuters was unable to obtain comment from Saab or Lizcano.
The distribution program known by the Spanish acronym CLAP has become a crucial source of food for Venezuelans facing hyper inflation, which has left a minimum wage salary so devalued it can barely buy a day's groceries.
But the program has faced widespread accusations by Venezuela's opposition and U.S. authorities of over-pricing food imports as part of a broad corruption racket.
Maduro has defended CLAP as an effort to help the country weather U.S. sanctions that have hobbled the OPEC nation's oil exports and made it increasingly difficult to import basic goods.
Diosdado Cabello, No. 2 of the ruling Socialist Party, delighted at the opposition's infighting.

""Nobody is clean in that corruption dispute in the opposition leadership, accusations come and go between them, they're a society of political merchants,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The identity of the gunmen was not immediately clear and further details on the attack had yet to emerge. Burkinabe armed forces were caring for the wounded and searching the area, the government said in a statement. 
This year an Islamist insurgency has ignited ethnic and religious tensions in Burkina Faso, rendering large parts of the country ungovernable, especially in northern areas bordering restive Mali. 
The attack took place in the village of Hantoukoura near the border with Niger in the Est region, an area known for banditry that has come under attack over the past year from suspected jihadist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State. 
On Nov. 6 gunmen opened fire on a convoy of buses carrying mine workers in the Est region, killing 39. 
The timing of the latest incident, during hours of worship, mirrored other attacks on Christians this year -- a new phenomenon in a West African country that has long prided itself on its religious tolerance. 
Burkina Faso was once a pocket of calm in the region, but the past year's violence has killed hundreds and forced nearly a million people from their homes.

    Reuters could not immediately independently confirm the report, which Respekt said was based on two sources with knowledge of the document.
The European Commission said on Friday it had sent the audit results to the Czech authorities, but said the contents were confidential as the audit procedure was ongoing.
    A spokesman for Agrofert said the company had no information on the audit results.
    Companies in the Agrofert group, the core of Babis's assets estimated at $3.5 billion by Forbes, are some of the largest recipients of EU subsidies, both for farming and for investment projects, in the central European country.  
They are run by two trust funds since 2017, an arrangement Babis made to meet local law on conflict of interest.
He reiterated in a television debate earlier on Sunday that he had met all legal obligations.
    The preliminary audit leaked in June had suggested the country may face calls to return millions of euros in EU aid that had been paid to Agrofert companies.
The EU probe was one of the triggers that brought hundreds of thousands of Czechs to rallies against Babis in the spring and autumn this year, the biggest protests since the end of communist rule 30 years ago. Babis's ANO party however remains by far the most popular Czech political group.
    A spokesman for the Czech Regional Development Ministry, which is in charge of handling the audit, said that the report had been received."

The boat, which survivors said had departed from Libya taking advantage of a respite in bad weather, was believed to carry some 170 people. The Lampedusa coast guard managed to bring safely onshore 147 migrants after the accident on Nov. 23.
After the new bout of bad weather blocked search operations for several days, on Sunday six coast guard divers helped by a remotely-operated submarine found four bodies underwater and a fifth one floating.
""We can only listen to the silence of the dead,"" Lampedusa mayor Totò Martello said.
""We're alone in rescuing their bodies at sea, in weeping for them and burying them. We're surrounded by silence and indifference.""
Prosecutors in the Sicilian town of Agrigento are investigating the accident. A judicial source said that based on interviews with the survivors the missing people were mostly Tunisian, Algerian and Pakistani.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The future of Germany's ruling coalition looked shaky after the election of new leaders of the Social Democrats (SPD) who are demanding a shift in policies, and several senior conservatives on Sunday ruled out talks to renegotiate a governing agreement.
Two strong leftist critics of the coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives - Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken - won a vote for leadership of the Social Democrats on Saturday, possibly putting the country, Europe's largest economy, at a political crossroads.
Their ascendancy raises the chances of an early election or a minority government if the SPD leaves the coalition, which could trigger political instability at a time when the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has become the country's third-largest party.
Walter-Borjans and Esken, who ran on a joint ticket, want to renegotiate the coalition deal to focus more on social justice, investment and climate policies, setting them on collision with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).
Speaking on public broadcaster ARD on Sunday, Walter-Borjans said raising investments and scratching temporary job contracts were issues that needed to be addressed.
""If the coalition partner then takes an obstructive approach for these new tasks then you have to make a decision that it cannot continue,"" he said.
Armin Laschet, the Christian Democrat premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, told broadcaster Deutschlandfunk earlier: ""Of course nothing will be renegotiated now. That's quite clear.""
Asked whether there was movement on the issues that the new SPD leadership wants to change in a new agreement, Laschet said: ""There is no such thing.""
Walter-Borjans and Esken beat Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Klara Geywitz, who said they would support their rivals. SPD delegates are set to approve the leadership - elected via a party ballot that ended Saturday - at a party conference starting on Dec. 6. They will also vote on the coalition.
SEEKING CONCESSIONS
In the latest sign that established party tie-ups are being tested, a three-way coalition consisting of CDU, SPD and the Greens agreed on Sunday on a government deal in Saxony, where the AfD came in second in a September election.
SPD members expect that the new leadership duo will not recommend leaving the coalition but rather will seek more concessions from the CDU, including dropping the target for a balanced budget and raising the minimum wage.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a CDU member, said giving up the balanced budget would be an additional burden for future generations, telling daily Handelsblatt that it had been one of the CDU's key promises during the election campaign.
Laschet said new demands were a problem of the SPD duo, not of the Christian Democrats, saying holding fresh elections would be irresponsible in the current environment.
Conservative Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner also said there was no chance of renegotiations, adding the CDU would stick to the promises it made. CDU deputy leader Thomas Strobl made similar comments.
Merkel, 65, has been in power since 2005 and has said she will not seek re-election at the next national election, due in 2021. The CDU is trying to boost its image and appeal to hold its position as the leading governing party after she goes.
Striking a slightly more conciliatory tone, the head of the CDU and Merkel's would-be successor as chancellor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, urged the Social Democrats to remain part of the government, adding the current coalition agreement provided the basis to move forward.

""I think it is good that the SPD has made a decision,"" she said. ""It paves the way to return to business. For the CDU it is quite clear: we stand by this coalition. We stand by this coalition on the basis that has been negotiated.""

Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist, was speaking on the first anniversary of his assumption of power to a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters in Mexico City's Zocalo central square.
The president took office pledging to raise economic growth to 4% per year. However, the economy has stagnated and slipped into a mild recession during the first half of the year.
Slowdowns in the first year of a new government are not uncommon in Mexico, which has had to contend with the threat of economic disruption by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Foreign investment to Mexico has held up, but domestic investors have been rattled by decisions made by Lopez Obrador, including his abrupt cancellation of a $13 billion new Mexico City airport a few weeks before he took office.
Lopez Obrador said the project was unsound and tainted by corruption, arguing that so-called ""neo-liberal"" policies have deepened social divisions and fueled gang violence in Mexico.
He has put welfare programs at the center of his economic policy, cutting out intermediaries in the distribution process that he said were siphoning off money intended for the poor.
Latin America's No. 2 economy depends heavily on access to the U.S. marketplace to fuel growth, and the government is eager for U.S. and Canadian lawmakers to approve a new trade deal known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Mexico approved the USMCA earlier this year and Lopez Obrador has urged the U.S. Congress to follow suit.

During his speech, the president said that he was confident the trade deal would be approved ""very soon.""

Since taking office in 2015 Law and Justice (PiS) has been at loggerheads with the European Union over reforms which critics say undermine judicial independence.
The suspension of Judge Pawel Juszczyszyn last week brought the issue back to the fore.
""I believe that law and honesty will win in the end,"" Juszczyszyn told protesters in front of the Ministry of Justice in Warsaw.
""I call on judges - don't let yourselves be frightened, be independent, be brave, we are strong,"" he said.
The government has justified the widespread judicial reforms - including how judges are appointed - by saying they are necessary to improve efficiency of courts and root out the vestiges of the 1945-89 communist era.
Protestors gathered in at least 105 towns and cities according to organizers, and television coverage showed them waving Polish and European Union flags and brandishing placards with slogans such as ""Without law there is no justice"".
Nobel prize-winning author Olga Tokarczuk had been among those calling on people to protest.
""I express my solidarity with the repressed judges and encourage you to join demonstrations in their defense,"" she tweeted.
Warsaw police declined to say how many were protesting in the city.
Juszczyszyn, a judge delegated to the regional court in Olsztyn, eastern Poland, from a lower level court was abruptly revoked when he questioned the appointment of a judge by a new body under rules introduced by PiS.
On Thursday, a disciplinary officer appointed by the minister of justice started a case against him and on Friday he was suspended."
1226,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>","As Christmas season starts, Pope defends nativity scenes in public places","By Philip Pullella
ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday defended the display of nativity scenes in town squares and other public places, which has become an annual contentious issue at Christmas time in countries such as the United States and France.
The pope traveled to the town of Greccio, east of Rome, to visit the spot where St. Francis of Assisi started the tradition by setting up the first nativity scene in 1223.
There, he signed a papal document known as an Apostolic Letter and titled ""Admirabile Signum,"" (Wonderful Sign) on the meaning and importance of the nativity scene.
""With this Letter, I wish to encourage the beautiful family tradition of preparing the nativity scene in the days before Christmas, but also the custom of setting it up in the workplace, in schools, hospitals, prisons and town squares,"" the document says.
Nativity scenes depict the birth of Jesus as Christians believe it took place - the baby and his mother posed in a humble stable setting with animals and shepherds, and kings bearing gifts who arrived days later.
The construction of such scenes in public squares or on government property is contested regularly by atheist, free speech or secularist groups.
In the United States, groups opposed to nativity scenes in public places say they violate the first amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits the establishment of a state religion.
In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing nativity scenes in public places, saying that they were not an effort to establish or support a particular religion and also possessed what the court called ""legitimate secular purposes"".
Still, even after that ruling, American groups have regularly challenged their use or have demanded equal space on public property to promote their non-religious views.
In 2014 in France, a court order to dismantle a nativity scene in a town hall because it violated the country's secular tradition prompted a backlash, which won support from right-wing politicians.
In other parts of the document, the pope said the purpose of the nativity scene was to teach ""that we cannot let ourselves be fooled by wealth and fleeting promises of happiness"" and that they were a reminder to help those less fortunate.
""From the manger, Jesus proclaims, in a meek yet powerful way, the need for sharing with the poor as the path to a more human and fraternal world in which no one is excluded or marginalized,"" he wrote.
Earlier, Francis urged people to resist the excesses of consumerism in the period leading up to Christmas, calling it a virus that attacks faith and offends the needy."

(Reuters) - Holiday travelers can go home again but it will take far longer than expected with snow, ice and rain slowing the busiest U.S. travel day of the Thanksgiving weekend on Sunday, forecasters said.
As much as 6 inches (15 cm) of snow was expected to blanket the Greater Boston area on Sunday into Monday, with less predicted for New York, changing to rain in both cities, said meteorologist Brian Hurley of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.
Powerful winds were forecast for Chicago, along with snow showers, Hurley said.
""It's certainly a messy travel day all around,"" Hurley said.
Flights cancellations and delays were mounting throughout Sunday, most in airports in San Francisco, Newark, Boston and Chicago. By midday, more than 400 U.S. flights were canceled and more than 1,500 delayed, according to FlightAware.com.
Snow, ice and rain slickened roadways on what the American Automobile Association called the busiest travel day of the busiest U.S. holiday weekend, which this year put a record 55 million people in the air and on the roads, rails and waterways to make it to their Thanksgiving feast. The challenge now is to make it home.
""Right now the real travel concerns start in the Upper Midwest, areas affected by heavy snowfall, even some ice,"" Hurley said.
Already, close to 2.5 feet (74 cm) of snow has piled up in the Black Hills of South Dakota and up to 1 foot (30 cm) was reported in Minnesota, with snow still falling and additional accumulations expected, he said. Michigan is already snow covered and was expecting another 8 inches, he said.

The court on Friday sentenced Bouterse, who was on an official visit to China, to 20 years in prison for the murder of 15 adversaries who spoke out against his seizure of power in a February 1980 coup.
Bouterse, who has dominated Suriname's politics in recent decades, has denied the charges. He is able to appeal the decision.
The former military officer returned to Suriname on Sunday before dawn and was greeted by a crowd of some 1,500 supporters dressed in purple, the color of his National Democratic Party.
Many shouted ""We want Bouta!"", his nickname, as security struggled to control them.
""The political game is played openly, so it was clear what was going to happen,"" said Bouterse, 74, during a news conference at a nearby resort. ""We will stay within the law and regulations. Politics needs to be answered with politics.""
He promised to consult with leaders of his National Democratic Party. Opposition parties have called for Bouterse to step down.
The military tribunal that issued the ruling has not served an arrest warrant and it remains unclear whether Bouterse will serve any jail time.
As a junior military officer, Bouterse took part in the 1980 coup against Suriname's first prime minister, Henck Arron, just five years after independence from the Netherlands. He immediately promoted himself to army chief-of-staff, becoming effective ruler of the nation of 560,000 people.
Bouterse led the South American country through the 1980s as head of a military government, then assumed office again in 2010 and secured re-election five years later."

VALETTA (Reuters) - Lawmakers from Malta’s ruling Labour Party stood by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat on Sunday but did not indicate what he may do next as he faces pressure to quit amid a crisis sparked by the investigation into a murdered journalist.
The party's parliamentary group met for four hours, saying afterward that lawmakers gave ""unanimous support to all decisions which the Prime Minister will be taking"".
Calls for Muscat to step down grew after the probe into the 2017 car bomb killing of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia led to charges on Saturday against a prominent businessman with alleged ties to ministers and senior officials.
Yorgen Fenech, 38, was taken to a Valletta court late on Saturday and charged with complicity in the murder. He pleaded not guilty to that and other charges.
The prime minister was thought to be preparing to announce his departure but seeking to stay in office until a successor is chosen, according to local media and government officials close to Muscat. Those same sources said he is likely to stay on until the party holds a leadership election in mid-January.
Fenech was charged after the government turned down his request for immunity from prosecution in return for revealing information about the murder plot and about alleged corruption involving Muscat’s former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi, among others, court filings showed.
Schembri and Mizzi resigned on Tuesday and Schembri was interrogated for two days by police before being released without charge. Schembri has denied any wrongdoing. Mizzi on Tuesday denied any business links with Fenech and any wrongdoing.
Maltese civil society organizations were due to hold a protest in Valetta, the capital of the tiny Mediterranean archipelago, on Sunday afternoon to call on Muscat to go immediately.
""This is far from over. This is just the beginning. Joseph Muscat is still put, still protecting his best friend Keith Schembri. Because by protecting Schembri, Muscat is protecting himself,"" activist group Repubblika, one of the organizers of the protest, said on Sunday .
""We must keep up the pressure, The truth is coming out. Now we must strive for justice,"" it added.
Caruana Galizia's family called on Saturday for Muscat to step aside.
Critics are angry with Muscat for sticking by Schembri, an old friend since school, and including Schembri in security briefings on the murder investigation even after Fenech was identified both as a suspect in the murder and an associate of Schembri.
CARDONA RETURNS
The Labour Party statement after its meeting on Sunday also said Chris Cardona, the economy minister who suspended himself from his duties on Tuesday after having been mentioned by a suspect in the investigation, has now been reinstated in his position.
Cardona has denied any involvement in the plot and has denied any corruption or wrongdoing.
Caruana Galizia had reported that Schembri and Mizzi had set up secret companies in Panama. She also reported how another company, called 17 Black, was meant to be a vehicle to deposit funds into those companies. Following her murder, an investigation by Reuters and Times of Malta showed Fenech as having been the owner of 17 Black. 
Mizzi has denied any business ties to Fenech or knowledge of 17 Black or any criminal activity.
Schembri has always denied any wrongdoing. Speaking on Saturday for the first time since his arrest, he denied being the author of a type-written letter that Fenech told police he secretly received after his arrest. Fenech said the letter told him to pin the blame for the murder on another government minister.

“I immediately denied that the letter came from me when the police were interrogating me and I stand by that completely,” Schembri told the Times of Malta.

Von der Leyen has set high targets in the European Union's policy to combat climate change, pledging to reduce the bloc's carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2030.
On Sunday, her first day at the helm, she repeated to journalists her objective to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, meaning carbon emissions should be fully offset by measures that cut CO2, like planting trees.
Emphasizing the importance of the ""Green Deal"", she will be in Madrid on Monday for the opening of the United Nations climate change conference, known formally as COP25.
That will be followed by legislative proposals from the Commission, expected on Dec. 11, aimed at turning her targets into legal texts that will need to be approved by EU states and lawmakers .
Her foreign policy priorities have so far been less clear.

The EU is a major trading partner with, and aid donor to, African countries. It has promised more investment to the continent to better tap its economic potential and stem the flow of African economic migrants who attempt perilous crossings of the Mediterranean to reach Europe.
Von der Leyen said she would go to Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to meet Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October, and President Sahle-Work Zewde, the only woman to hold such a position in Africa.
She will also meet Moussa Faki, the chairman of the African Union Commission, which has its headquarters in Addis Ababa."

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday he would strengthen prison sentences, vowing to boost security after an attack in the British capital by a man convicted of terrorism who was released early from prison.
With less than two weeks before Britain heads to the polls, law and order has raced to the top of the election agenda after Usman Khan, wearing a fake suicide vest and wielding knives, killed two people on Friday before being shot dead by police.
Johnson's Conservatives have championed tough police and prison measures, but opponents have criticized the governing party for overseeing almost a decade of cuts to public services.
Johnson said if he won the Dec. 12 election he would invest more money in the prison system and make sentences tougher.
""We are going to bring in tougher sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders and for terrorists,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. 
""I absolutely deplore the fact that this man was out on the street, I think it was absolutely repulsive and we are going to take action."" 
He was keen to portray his rival for prime minister, Jeremy Corbyn, as being weak on crime, blaming the Labour Party for bringing in a law that automatically released some prisoners early when it was in government more than a decade ago.
Johnson said there were probably about 74 people convicted of serious offences who had been released under the legislation, adding that they were being monitored to ensure there was no threat to the public. 
Corbyn, a veteran peace campaigner, said he believed convicted terrorists should ""not necessarily"" serve their full prison terms.
""It depends on the circumstances, it depends on the sentence, but crucially it depends on what they've done in the prison,"" he told Sky News.
Corbyn said Conservative cuts to community policing, the probation service, mental health, and youth and social services could ""lead to missed chances to intervene in the lives of people who go on to commit inexcusable acts"".
""You can't keep people safe on the cheap,"" he said in a speech on Sunday. 
INVESTIGATION
Khan's attack on a Friday on London Bridge stirred memories of Britain's last election in 2017, when three militants killed eight and injured at least 48 in the same part of the capital.
Bystanders on Friday wrestled Khan to the ground before the police shot him dead. So far the police have found no evidence to suggest Khan was working with others.
Both of the people killed were Cambridge University graduates. One has been named as Jack Merritt, who worked for the group that organized a prisoner rehabilitation conference attended by Khan before his attack. 
The other victim, a woman, was a former student at the university, its vice chancellor said on Sunday. 
Two people remain in hospital in a stable condition. A third person left hospital on Sunday.
The attack brought a somber tone to what has often been an ill-natured election campaign, which is presenting voters with a stark choice - Labour's promise to raise taxes on the rich and businesses to fund a much expanded state or the Conservatives' pledge to ""get Brexit done"" and move onto other issues.

While Corbyn's team struck a moderate tone, with his top legal policy adviser Shami Chakrabarti questioning whether it was the time to make ""knee-jerk"" policy changes, Johnson again said only he could deliver Brexit, allowing Britain to turn to reforms such as to the criminal justice system.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2019 09:55AM ET</span>","'War against nature must stop,' U.N. chief says before climate talks","By Isla Binnie
MADRID (Reuters) - The world must stop a ""war against nature"" and find more political will to combat climate change, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday, the eve of a two-week global climate summit in Madrid.
Around the world, extreme weather ranging from wildfires to floods is being linked to manmade global warming, putting pressure on the summit to strengthen the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement on limiting the rise in temperature.
""Our war against nature must stop, and we know that it is possible,"" Guterres said ahead of the Dec. 2-13 summit.
""We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions.""
Cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases - mostly from burning carbon-based fossil fuels - that have been agreed so far under the Paris deal are not enough to limit temperature rises to a goal of between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius (2.7-3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.
Many countries are not even meeting those commitments, and political will is lacking, Guterres said.
President Donald Trump for his part has started withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, while the deforestation of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) basin - a crucial carbon reservoir - is accelerating and China has tilted back toward building more coal-fired power plants.
Seventy countries have committed to a goal of 'carbon neutrality' or 'climate neutrality' by 2050.
This means they would balance out greenhouse emissions, for instance through carbon capture technology or by planting trees.
But Guterres said these pledges were not enough.
""We also see clearly that the world's largest emitters are not pulling their weight,"" he said, ""and without them, our goal is unreachable.""
Last year's U.N. climate summit in Poland yielded a framework for reporting and monitoring emissions pledges and updating plans for further cuts. But sticking points remain, not least over an article on how to put a price on emissions, and so allow them to be traded.
""I don't even want to entertain the possibility that we do not agree on article 6,"" Guterres said. ""We are here to approve guidelines to implement article 6, not to find excuses not to do it.""
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has accepted an invitation to become U.N. special envoy on climate action and climate finance from Jan. 1, Guterres said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court will hear its first major gun rights case in nearly a decade on Monday in a challenge backed by the National Rifle Association over a now-amended New York City handgun regulation that had prevented licensed owners from taking their handguns outside the city. 
The nine justices will hear arguments in an appeal by three handgun owners and the New York state affiliate of the NRA - the gun rights group closely aligned with President Donald Trump and other Republicans - who say the regulation violates the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. 
Gun control advocates have said that if the justices choose to issue a broad ruling expanding gun rights, it could jeopardize a variety of firearms restrictions passed in recent years by state and local governments across the country, including expanded background checks and confiscations of weapons from individuals who a court has deemed dangerous.
Gun control is a contentious issue in the United States, which has experienced numerous mass shootings. Since 2013, 45 states and the District of Columbia have adopted more than 300 gun control laws, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Republican opposition in Congress has been instrumental in thwarting passage of new federal laws. 
""The future of life-saving gun safety laws across our country is very directly on the line with this case,"" the center's litigation director Hannah Shearer said.
The court has a 5-4 conservative majority. Its ruling is due by the end of June. 
""I believe it will change the way the Second Amendment is applied to everyone who owns a gun in the country,"" said Staten Island resident Romolo Colantone, one of the plaintiffs. 
The dispute centers on New York's handgun ""premises"" licenses that allowed holders to transport their firearm only to a handful of shooting ranges within the city, and to hunting areas elsewhere in the state during designated hunting seasons.
The transport rule was amended in July to specifically allow for a gun to be taken to a range or other residence outside the city. The city unsuccessfully asked the Supreme Court to cancel the arguments and drop the case because the amendment removed the provision being challenged.
The New York State Rifle and Pistol Association filed the lawsuit in 2013 along with three city residents who were told by authorities they could not participate in a shooting competition in New Jersey or bring their guns to a home elsewhere in the state.
The plaintiffs are appealing a 2018 ruling by the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the regulation did not violate the Second Amendment and advanced the city's interest in protecting public safety. 
The Supreme Court has avoided taking up a major firearms case since 2010, when it extended to state and local regulations a 2008 ruling that recognized for the first time that the Second Amendment protects a person's right to keep a gun at home for self-defense. 

That has left open questions such as whether that right extends outside the home. The challengers also are asking the Supreme Court to require lower courts to more strictly review gun curbs, with an eye toward striking them down.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders on Sunday celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Lisbon Treaty, the union's legal cornerstone, amid calls to reform a bloc weakened over the past decade by economic and migration crises, rising euroskepticism and Brexit.
Sunday was also the first day at work for a new EU executive under its German president, Ursula von der Leyen.
""Europe is a promise, is future, is something we all have to build, brick by brick and day by day,"" von der Leyen said.
Ten years after the Lisbon Treaty came into force, a bloc conceived to forge unity from the ashes of World War Two finds itself beset by divisions.
Germany and France, long the EU's main axis, last week called for a ""Conference on the Future of Europe"", reporting by mid-2022, to make the EU ""more united and sovereign"".. 
The Lisbon Treaty simplified decision making in a union recently expanded to 28 members with the inclusion of 12 states from the former Soviet bloc.
It strengthened the role of the elected European Parliament and reduced governments' veto powers over legislative changes, but still left several areas such as foreign policy and tax requiring unanimity - and thus vulnerable to veto from a single member state.
In 2015, the bloc embarrassingly failed to apply a common asylum policy to tackle an influx of refugees from the Middle East - its worst migration crisis since World War Two. 

It is also divided about economic reform, raising fears that the euro currency, shared by 19 of its member states, may not be strong enough to withstand a future financial crisis.

Abdul Mahdi's decision to quit on Friday came after a call by Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani for parliament to consider withdrawing its support for Abdul Mahdi's government to stem the violence.
""The Iraqi parliament will ask the president of state to nominate a new prime minister,"" a statement from parliament's media office said.
Lawmakers said Abdul Mahdi's government, including the prime minister himself, would stay on in a caretaker capacity following Sunday's vote until a new government was chosen.
Under the constitution, President Barham Salih is expected to ask the largest bloc in parliament to nominate a new prime minister to form a government, a move expected to trigger weeks of political wrangling.
Iraqi forces have killed nearly 400 mostly young, unarmed demonstrators since mass anti-government protests broke out on Oct. 1. More than a dozen members of the security forces have also died in clashes.
Abdul Mahdi’s resignation, though welcomed by protesters, is not expected to end the demonstrations, which have called for an overhaul of a political system accused of being corrupt and keeping most of the population in poverty, without opportunity.
Demonstrations are continuing in Baghdad and other southern regions and security forces killed one protester and wounded nine others near a key bridge in the capital on Sunday, police and a medical source said.
The unrest poses the biggest challenge for Iraq since Islamic State insurgents seized swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory in 2014.

""According to updated information, 19 people died, 21 have various injuries,"" the local government for the Zabaikalsk region said in a statement.
Russia's emergencies ministry said in a statement on its website that the bus, traveling from the town of Sretensk to the city of Chita, 6,320-km (3,930 miles) east of Moscow, fell from a bridge into the Kuenga river at around 0938 Moscow time (0638 GMT).

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Police fired tear gas to disperse thousands of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday, ending a rare lull in violence, as residents took to the streets chanting ""revolution of our time"" and ""liberate Hong Kong"". 
The protest in the busy shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui followed a march by hundreds of people to the U.S. consulate to show ""gratitude"" for U.S. support for the demonstrations that have agitated the Chinese-ruled city for six months. 
Shops and businesses in the area closed early as police sprayed volleys of tear gas at protesters, including some elderly residents and others with their pets, as they marched past the city's Kowloon waterfront, home to luxury hotels and shopping malls. 
Police made several arrests as the tear gas sent hundreds fleeing toward the harbor. 
Hong Kong, a major financial hub, had enjoyed relative calm for the past week since local elections last Sunday delivered an overwhelming victory to pro-democracy candidates. 
Activists pledged, however, to maintain the momentum of the anti-government movement. Protests in the former British colony since June have at times forced the closure of government offices, businesses, schools and even the international airport.
Waving posters that read ""Never forget why you started"" and black flags with the logo ""Revolution now"", protesters occupied several main roads on Sunday, with young residents and families with children filling the nearby streets. 
""We had demonstrations, peaceful protests, lobbying inside the council, a lot of things we have done but they all failed,"" said Felix, a 25-year-old university graduate. 
""There are still five demands,"" he said, referring to protesters' calls that include an independent inquiry into police behavior and the implementation of universal suffrage. 
Some black-clad protesters wearing gas masks built barricades and blocked roads near luxury stores, including Armani, while others headed toward Hung Hom, a district near the ruined campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 
The campus turned into a battleground in mid-November when protesters barricaded themselves in and faced off riot police in violent clashes of petrol bombs, water cannon and tear gas. 
About 1,100 people were arrested last week, some while trying to escape. 
Police withdrew from the university on Friday after collecting evidence and removing dangerous items including thousands of petrol bombs, arrows and chemicals that had been strewn around the site.
By Sunday night, the crowds of protesters had diminished and some roads reopened to traffic. Police said hundreds of ""rioters"" had hurled smoke bombs, ""stirring up public fear and causing chaos"" which forced them to fire tear gas. 
THANK YOU TRUMP
Sunday's marches, which were permitted by authorities, came as a top Hong Kong official said the government was looking into setting up an independent committee to review the handling of the crisis, in which demonstrations have become increasingly violent. 
The protesters are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
China denies interfering, says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest. 
Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of protesters waved American flags, with some donning Donald Trump logo hats and t-shirts, as they unfurled a banner depicting the U.S. president standing astride a tank with a U.S. flag behind him. 
Trump this week signed into law congressional legislation supporting protesters, despite angry objections from Beijing. 
In the morning, hundreds of protesters marched in protest against police use of tear gas. 
Carrying yellow balloons and waving banners that read ""No tear gas, save our children"", the protesters streamed through the city's central business district toward government headquarters on the main Hong Kong island. 
""We want the police to stop using tear gas,"" said a woman surnamed Wong, who marched with her husband and 5-year-old son. 
Police have fired around 10,000 rounds of tear gas since June, the city's secretary for security, John Lee, said this week. 
On Saturday, secondary school students and retirees joined forces to protest against what they called police brutality and unlawful arrests. 

Further protests are planned through the week. A big test of support for the anti-government campaign is expected on Dec. 8 in a rally planned by Civil Human Rights Front, the group that organized million-strong marches in June.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Timothy Weeks, the Australian academic released by the Taliban in November after being kept hostage for more than three years, said on Sunday that hope helped him survive the ordeal.
Weeks and U.S. citizen Kevin King were freed by the Taliban in return for the release of three Taliban commanders. The two were kidnapped in August 2016 outside Kabul's American University of Afghanistan where they worked.
Speaking publicly for the first time since his release a visibly emotional Weeks said that the ""long and tortuous ordeal"" had a profound effect on him.
""At times, I felt as if my death was imminent and that I would never return to see those that I loved again,"" Weeks said in Sydney in remarks televised by the Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""But, by the will of God, I am here. I am alive and I am safe. And I am free. There is nothing else in the world that I need.""
He said that he had never given up hope, although his freedom took longer than he expected.
""If you give up hope, there is very little left for you,"" he added.
Kidnapping has been a major problem in Afghanistan for many years. Most victims are Afghans and many kidnappers are criminal gangs seeking ransoms but foreigners have also been abducted for political ends.
The 50-year old teacher from Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, who returned to Australia on Thursday, also said that he believed that there were six attempts made to free him and King, including U.S. Navy SEAL forces in at least one instance.
""We were woken in the morning at around 2 a.m. and we were taken down into the tunnels. We were told by our guards that it was Daesh, and I've since learnt that I believe now that it was the Navy SEALs coming in to get us,"" he said.
He said that although both were treated ""as well as could be expected"", they were moved around various locations and sometimes kept in dark cells.
Weeks said he does not hate the guards who were watching him.
""A lot of people don't admit this, but for me, they were soldiers. And soldiers obey the commands of their commanders. Then don't get a choice,"" Weeks said.
""Some of them were so compassionate and such lovely, lovely people. And it really led me to think about... You know, how did they end up like this?"""

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The Australian state of New South Wales, home to the country's largest city Sydney, rolled out mobile phone detection cameras on Sunday, hoping to cut the number of fatalities on its roads by a third over two years, transport authorities said.
The world-first mobile phone detection cameras, according to Transport for NSW, which manages the state's transport services, operate day and night in all weather conditions to determine if a driver is handling a mobile phone.
""It's a system to change the culture,"" NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Michael Corboy told Australian media last week.
Making or receiving voice calls while driving in NSW is legal, but only when using a hands-free device. All other functions, such as video calling, using social media and photography, are illegal while behind the wheel.
So far this year 329 people have died on NSW roads, compared with 354 people for all of 2018, according to official statistics. The state wants to cut the number of road fatalities by 30% by 2021.
The mobile phone detection cameras use artificial intelligence to review images and detect illegal use of the devices, Transport for NSW said in a statement.
Images that the automated system identifies as likely to contain a driver illegally using a mobile phone are verified by authorized personnel.
For the first three months after the detection systems are in operation, offending drivers will be issued warning letters. After that, the penalty will be a A$344 ($233) standard fine and a A$457 fine in a school zone. In both cases, drivers will also receive penalty points."

TAMBAKLOROK, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian fisherman Miskan says the once-abundant catches he used to enjoy have been dwindling in recent years on this stretch of the Java Sea.
His meager income is being further strained by having to borrow cash to shore up his home against lapping waves coming further inland on this vulnerable coastline.
""If you have a house on land and then work at sea, it's hard. But now I work at sea and I live at sea,"" said Miskan, 44, who uses one name, speaking outside his small home, where a caged songbird hangs from the rafters.
His community's battle against inundation, blamed on both man-made environmental destruction and the impact of climate change, reflects the risks posed to millions of people by a sinking coastline on Indonesia's most populous island of Java.
The flooding in Tambaklorok in Central Java province is now so bad that Miskan uses a window to enter his home since his door is half blocked by dirt piled up to keep out the sea.
""It's hard to save money when you're a fisherman,"" he said.
Miskan had to borrow from neighbors to pay roughly 7.2 million rupiah ($500) to hire workers to truck in earth.
Thousands of people in Asia and Europe joined rallies demanding more action on climate change on Friday, aiming to force political leaders to come up with urgent solutions at a United Nations conference that starts on Monday.
Indonesia, an archipelago of thousands of islands, has about 81,000 km (50,300 miles) of coastline, making it particularly vulnerable to climate change along with neighbors like the Philippines.
It is also home to more than a fifth of the world's mangrove forests, which naturally help keep out high tidal waters. But for years, coastal communities have chopped down mangrove forests to clear the way for fish and shrimp farms, and for rice paddies.
The government has scrambled to work with environmental groups to replant mangroves, build dykes and relocate threatened villages.
But many residents, often poor fishermen, are either reluctant to leave their homes or simply have nowhere to go further inland on Java, home to around 140 million people.
""It is impossible for us to move due to economic reasons, so even though there's tidal floods, I'll stay,"" said Abdul Hadi, whose house in Tambaklorok is now below sea levels and the road.
Another villager, Solihatun, 51, regularly needs her roof removed so that the height of the walls can be raised as earth is spread in and around her house. She says the flooding is sometimes so bad her grandchildren can swim in the living room.
""Thank God for bank loans, so it's easier to pay off the debt every month,"" she said, adding she had spent over 5 million rupiah for the last renovation.
Feri Prihantoro of the Bina Karta Lestari Foundation, a non-government organization (NGO) focused on sustainable development, said the area's coastline was particularly vulnerable to flooding and high tides due to land subsidence because of the extraction of underground water and higher sea levels.
Further along the Java coast, Jakarta is also prone to flooding with two-fifths of the city lying below sea level.
With this partly in mind, President Joko Widodo announced in August a $33 billion plan to move the capital to Borneo island."

The state government said state security officials clashed with gunmen in the small town of Villa Union, about 40 miles (65 km) southwest of the border city of Piedras Negras.
Standing outside the Villa Union mayor's bullet-ridden offices, state governor Miguel Angel Riquelme told reporters the deaths of seven gunmen had been confirmed, and four police.
The state government said in a statement shortly afterward three other gunmen were also killed, bringing the total to ten.
An unspecified number of people were also missing, including some who were at the mayor's office, the governor said.
Around midday, heavy gunfire began ringing out, and a convoy of armed pickup trucks could be seen moving around Villa Union, according to video clips posted by social media users. Others showed plumes of smoke rising from the town.
Reuters could not vouch for their authenticity.
The outbreak of violence occurred during a testing week for the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who on Friday said he would not accept any foreign intervention in Mexico to deal with violent criminal gangs.
Lopez Obrador says Mexico will handle the problem.
Earlier in the week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to designate Mexican cartels as terrorist groups, sparking concerns the move could serve as a prelude to the United States trying to intervene unilaterally in Mexico.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr is due to visit Mexico next week to discuss cooperation over security.
Lopez Obrador took office a year ago pledging to pacify the country after more than a decade of gang-fueled violence.
A series of recent security lapses has raised questions about the left-leaning administration's strategy.
Criticism has focused on the Nov. 4 massacre of nine women and children of U.S.-Mexican origin, and the armed forces' release of a captured son of drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman under pressure from cartel gunmen in the city of Culiacan.
Coahuila has a history of gang violence, though the homicide total in the state is well below where it was seven years ago. National homicide levels are pushing record levels."

Geingob, Namibia's third leader since the sparsely populated and mostly arid country freed itself from the shackles of apartheid South Africa in 1990, was seeking a second and final term in the Nov. 27 election.
First elected in 2014 with 87% of the vote, Geingob garnered 56.3% and avoided a potential re-run against a member of his own party, Panduleni Itula, who was running as an independent.
Itula, a dentist-turned-politician, trailed behind with 29.4% of the vote, and the leader of the official opposition party, McHenry Venaani, was in third position with 5.3%.
Geingob told cheering crowds that he was proud that the elections were free and fair. 
""I am just a proud Namibian that we could have free and fair elections, no fighting, no attacking each other, free movement was allowed,"" said Geingob. 
In the legislative vote to choose 96 members of parliament, the ruling party lost its two-thirds majority after the ruling party secured 63 seats, down from 77 seats, while the official opposition party, Venaani’s Popular Democratic Movement (PDM) party, will hold 16 seats, improving from its 2014 total of five in the legislative chamber.
Opposition leader Venaani told Reuters that they were considering approaching the courts over ""anomalies and irregularities"" during the election. 
The ECN had previously said the vote-tallying would take 48 hours, but it announced the winner after 72 hours, raising concerns over the potential for vote rigging.
A sputtering economy, one of Namibia's worst-ever droughts and the biggest corruption scandal in its history have weighed on support for Geingob. 
The economy has been stuck in a recession for nearly three years, marred by a drought that ravaged agricultural export crops, as well as by unprofitably low prices for Namibia's main hard commodities, uranium and diamonds.
A scandal, in which two ministers were alleged to have conspired to dole out fishing licenses to Iceland's biggest fishing firm, Samherji, in return for kickbacks, also has taken the shine off the ruling party.

Abdelwahed Hablani, 25, set himself on fire and died in hospital on Friday in protest at poverty and poor living conditions, echoing the 2010 self immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, whose death triggered the Arab Spring.
The protesters on Saturday afternoon burnt tires before police intervened to reopen roads, firing tear gas canisters, the witnesses said, but the demonstrations were continuing late into Saturday evening.
Hablani had occasional work as a casual laborer in Jelma, located near Bouazizi's home city of Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia's deeply impoverished interior. He was buried on Saturday.
Since Bouazizi's death in December 2010, numerous young men have followed his example by setting themselves alight in the face of Tunisia's chronic economic difficulties.
Mass protests that followed Bouazizi's funeral resulted in January 2011 in a revolution that pushed from power the veteran autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who died in exile in Saudi Arabia in September, and introduced democracy.
Tunisia held free presidential and parliamentary elections in September and October, but economic frustrations and perceived failures of repeated elected governments to improve state services led voters to largely reject the major parties."

VALETTA (Reuters) - One of Malta’s wealthiest men, Yorgen Fenech, was charged in a Valletta court on Saturday with complicity to murder in the car bomb killing of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017.
The probe into the murder of Caruana Galizia, a campaigning journalist who investigated and exposed corruption, has spawned a political crisis for the government of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who appeared to be close to resigning on Saturday.
Fenech pleaded not guilty to the charge of complicity to murder and to other charges related to the case, which included membership of a criminal gang and conspiracy to cause an explosion.
Official sources said Muscat was expected to make a statement announcing his resignation later in the evening or on Sunday. No official statement has been issued.
Media on the Mediterranean island had said earlier that Muscat planned to announce his resignation if charges were filed against Fenech.
Asked about this before Fenech was charged, a spokesman for the prime minister said that Muscat “has pledged various times he wants to see this case through. He will make announcements in due course”.
Fenech, 38, was taken to court under an armed police escort almost two years to the day since three men were charged with having set off the bomb that killed the journalist on Oct. 16, 2017.
The three have pleaded not guilty and are still awaiting trial.
Fenech said when he spoke to journalists on Friday that the ""truth will come out"".
Immediately after Fenech was charged, the family of Caruana Galizia issued a statement saying: ""We now expect the Prime Minister to leave office, and parliament, with immediate effect to allow a free and full investigation into his and (former chief of staff) Keith Schembri’s role in Daphne’s assassination.""
Muscat has been in power since 2013, having won two general elections in a row, the last in 2017. His Labour Party is expected to hold a leadership election in January.
MIDDLEMAN
Fenech was arrested on Nov. 20, days after another man, Melvin Theuma, was arrested in a money-laundering case and immediately told police he had been the middleman in the murder plot and offered information in return for a pardon.
The Maltese government accepted Theuma’s pardon request but later turned down another request for a pardon by Fenech.
In seeking his own pardon, Fenech said in court documents that he could give more information on the murder plot and corruption involving former chief of staff Schembri and former Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi, among others.
Both Schembri and Mizzi resigned on Tuesday. The police arrested and questioned Schembri for two days but then released him without charge.
Schembri has not commented since his resignation or arrest. He previously denied any wrongdoing. Mizzi on Tuesday denied any business links with Fenech and any wrongdoing.
Caruana Galizia had reported that Schembri and Mizzi owned secret companies in Panama. She also reported that another company, called 17 Black, was being used as a vehicle to deposit 5,000 euros a day into the Panama companies. Several months after Caruana Galizia was killed, an investigation by Reuters and the Times of Malta showed that 17 Black was owned by Fenech.
There is no evidence that funds were ever transferred and Mizzi has denied any connection with 17 Black or the murder.
The links between Fenech, Mizzi and Schembri put Muscat under pressure to resign after having refused to fire Mizzi and Schmebri.
Caruana Galizia, 53, was killed by a car bomb as she drove out of her home in Bidnija, seven miles (11 km) from Valletta, just half an hour after writing a blog describing Schembri as ""a crook"".
Investigators, who included members of the FBI and Europol, subsequently told a court that the bomb was set off from a yacht off Valletta harbour.
Fenech himself was arrested this month on board a different yacht as he tried to leave Malta. He formally handed over the reins of his business empire – including real estate, hospitality and casinos - to his brother just a day before."

PHOENIX (Reuters) - Two children were found dead and another was missing in Arizona on Saturday after the vehicle they were in became stuck while crossing a storm-swollen forest creek outside Phoenix, part of a post-Thanksgiving winter storm that pummeled wide swathes of the country.
The storm system has been slowly moving eastward across the United States, clogging the Midwest with snow and disrupting flights on the busiest travel weekend of the year.
The children were reported missing late Friday afternoon after a vehicle got stuck in Tonto Creek near Tonto Basin, northeast of Phoenix, the Gila County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.
Rescue workers in helicopters successfully reached four other children and an adult who were stranded on an island in the creek and a second adult who was on the shore. A search was launched for the three missing children.
Two of those children, a boy and a girl, both about 5 years old, were found dead on Saturday about three miles downstream from where the vehicle became submerged, said Virgil Dodd, a sheriff spokesman.
About 30 first responders were still searching for the missing girl.
""We hope we find the last one and bring her to safety,"" Dodd said.
The two adults were parents of four of the seven children involved in the incident. Dodd said the group was believed to be from out of town, but no details were known.
The group was in the area for a family reunion during the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, the KPNX news channel reported.
Blizzards and deep snowfalls were forecast for much of the Midwest and Northeast for the rest of the weekend as millions of Americans travel home from their holiday feasts, the National Weather Service said."

The military said the troops were carrying out operations in the area to prevent militant attacks when they saw three Palestinians throwing petrol bombs at an Israeli car traveling on a nearby road.
The troops then opened fire and saw that one suspect had been hit, the military said in a statement. The two other suspects were taken into custody for questioning.
Palestinian officials made no immediate comment about the incident which took place near the West Bank city of Hebron. The Health Ministry provided no further details.
Palestinians seek a state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
In the West Bank, most of which is controlled by the Israeli army, Palestinians have limited self-rule.
Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. The enclave is ruled by the Islamist Hamas group and is under an Israeli and Egyptian security blockade. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized abroad and regards the entire city as its eternal indivisible capital.

The unrest began on Nov. 15 after the government of the Islamic Republic, one of OPEC's biggest oil producers, announced gasoline price hikes. But the protests quickly turned political, with demonstrators demanding the removal of top leaders.
Khamenei has described the violence as the work of a ""very dangerous conspiracy"". The Tehran government has blamed ""thugs"" linked to its opponents in exile and the country's main foreign foes, namely the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Iran has given no official death toll, but Amnesty International has said that at least 161 people have been killed. Tehran has rejected this figure.
Mousavi's comments about Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, were posted in a statement on the opposition Kaleme website. He made a reference to an infamous 1978 massacre which rallied public support and led to the toppling of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
""The killers of the year 1978 were the representatives of a non-religious regime and the agents and shooters of November 2019 are the representatives of a religious government,"" he said. ""Then the commander in chief was the Shah and today, here, the Supreme Leader with absolute authority.""
He called on the government to ""pay attention to the repercussions of the Jaleh square killings"" of 1978.
Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi ran in a presidential election in June 2009 but lost out to hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The two men became figureheads for Iranians who staged mass protests after the vote, which they said was rigged.
Karroubi, Mousavi and Mousavi's wife Zahra Rahnavard have been under house arrest in Tehran since 2011 after the opposition leaders called on supporters to rally in solidarity with pro-democracy uprisings in Arab countries."

The election already looks highly unpredictable. Ouattara's main coalition partner defected last year, and his bitter rival, former president Laurent Gbagbo, could return after being acquitted of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Ouattara, 77, has said he intends to hand power to a younger generation but he has also argued that a constitutional change in 2016 has canceled previous term limits, enabling him to stand again. His opponents dispute this.
Addressing thousands of supporters at a rally in the central town of Katiola, Ouattara said: ""I want everyone in my generation to step aside.""
But ""if they decide to be a candidate, then I will be a candidate,"" he said, referring to Gbagbo, 74, and 85-year-old former president and ally, Henri Konan Bedie.
The alliance struck in 2005 between Ouattara's RDR and Bedie's PDCI was meant to dominate for generations and help heal the political rifts that led to civil war three years earlier.
But the pact that propelled Ouattara to presidential election victories in 2010 and 2015 collapsed in September 2018, as the parties bickered over whose candidate should be in pole position next time round.
Bedie's party is expected to announce its candidate next year.
Former rebel leader Guillaume Soro, 47, announced in October he would run in the election, the first major politician to do so.

Turkey says it has captured 287 militants in northeast Syria, where Turkish troops launched an offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia last month, and has hundreds more jihadist suspects in detention.
It began deporting foreign citizens linked to Islamic State earlier this month and Ireland confirmed shortly afterwards that Lisa Smith and her daughter were the two Irish citizens identified by Ankara for deportation.
""It is anticipated that two Irish citizens, Lisa Smith and her daughter will return to Ireland this weekend,"" Varadkar told reporters.
""Obviously when it comes to her daughter, she's a child and she will be protected. In relation to Lisa Smith, the Gardai (Irish police) are going to want to speak to her, they may be in a position to charge her and if they do a prosecution may follow.""
Dublin has said for months that it has a responsibility to find a way to bring Smith back to Ireland after she became aligned to the militant group in Syria and that its main concern was for the safe repatriation of her daughter.
Smith had said in media interviews that she wished to return home.
Varadkar had previously said that a security assessment would need to be carried out to ensure that Smith ""does not become a threat to life and limb in Ireland.""
Turkey has accused its European allies of being too slow to take back their citizens who had traveled to the Middle East to join Islamic State. Meanwhile, European countries are trying to speed up a plan to move thousands of jihadists out of Syrian prisons and into Iraq.
So far Turkey has repatriated 10 German nationals, one U.S. citizen, and one British suspected fighter. Eleven detainees from France will be repatriated in early December, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu was quoted as saying on Thursday."

DURRES, Albania (Reuters) - Albania ended its search on Saturday for survivors of a powerful earthquake that killed 51 people, and buried more victims of the disaster including toddler twins and their mother.
The 6.4-magnitude quake, the country's worst ever, struck on Tuesday, centered 30 km west of the capital Tirana. It was felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia, on the other side of the Adriatic Sea from Albania.
There have been hundreds of aftershocks, some with a magnitude of more than 5.0, rocking already damaged buildings and terrifying residents.
On Saturday, rescuers called a halt to efforts to find survivors in the rubble. At the Mira Mare hotel, on the Adriatic seafront in the city of Durres, a mechanized digger had ground to a halt near the ruins of concrete slabs, water boilers, mattresses and curtains from the six-storey building.
""No other bodies were found at the Mira Mare,"" a government spokesman said.
The 51th victim was a 20-year-old woman who died on Saturday. She had been struck on the head by falling bricks in a western district of Tirana, making her the only victim in the capital.
Most of the others were in Durres, Albania's second-biggest city and main port, and the nearby town of Thumane.
Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas between Greece and Montenegro, Albania is prone to seismic activity. This earthquake was Albania's deadliest; the previous highest toll was in 1979 when a quake killed 40 people.
Poorly-equipped Albanian troops rescued survivors from the rubble of buildings sometimes digging them out with their bare hands, until 250 troops from European countries and the United States came to their aid.
Durres authorities fanned out across the city to distribute food but some residents complained they had not received supplies.
In one case, a car trying to distribute food was surrounded by a large crowd and drove away. ""The poor get nothing,"" a white-haired lady of 65 said in despair.
She and others, who did not want to share their names, said they were not allowed back into their houses for safety reasons, and had to rely on donated food supplies.
Conscious of the difficulties, the government said it had set up national operational centers, and a phone line for people in need of food and clothing to call for help.
In a wave of solidarity, Albanians have been donating food and clothing in city centers. The GoFundMe crowdfunding platform said that, as of Friday, $3.2 million had been raised worldwide to help survivors of the disaster."

SHADNAGAR, India (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters gathered outside a police station on the outskirts of the Indian city of Hyderabad on Saturday demanding four men accused of raping and murdering a 27-year-old woman be handed over to them.
Some protesters clashed with police, hurling slippers, after the charred body of the woman, a veterinarian, was found in the town of Shadnagar, near Hyderabad, on Thursday.
Police said medical evidence would be hard to obtain given the state of the body but that they were working on the assumption the victim had been raped.
The four accused were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days, police said.
The victim's mother demanded that the culprits be burnt alive, the Times of India newspaper quoted her as saying.
The incident is reminiscent of the fatal gang rape of a young woman, labeled Nirbhaya (Fearless) by Indian media, on board a bus in 2012. The crime sparked widespread protests and drew international attention to violence against women in India.
The current case has also provoked outrage on social media with #HangRapists trending on Twitter in India.
""It has been 7 yrs to the gut-wrenching #Nirbhaya case & our moral fabric continues to be in pieces,"" Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar tweeted. ""We need stricter laws. This needs to STOP!""
India's National Commission for Women has condemned the incident, with its head Rekha Sharma saying it ""won't leave any stone unturned till these perpetrators get the punishment they deserve"".
The commission advises the government on policy regarding women's rights and aims to provide a voice for issues ranging from sexual exploitation to employment, but has no judicial powers.
On Saturday, around 30 protesters including college students rallied outside a police station in central Delhi, carrying placards demanding justice and an end to crime against women.
""If your blood doesn't boil even now, it's not blood but water,"" they chanted.
One of the protesters, student Kanchan Pal, 19, said she wanted to raise her voice in support of rape victims.
""Women are being raped everywhere, whether it is Delhi or Hyderabad or any other state,"" said Pal. ""We don't feel safe."""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Secondary school students and retirees joined forces to protest in Hong Kong on Saturday, the first of several weekend rallies planned across the city, as pro-democracy activists vowed to battle what they say are police brutality and unlawful arrests.
A top Hong Kong official said the government was looking into setting up an independent committee to review the handling of the crisis, in which demonstrations have become increasingly violent since they began more than five months ago.
Hong Kong has seen relative calm since local elections last week delivered an overwhelming victory to pro-democracy candidates. Still, activists appear keen to maintain the momentum of their movement. 
""I came out for the peaceful protest in June when there was more than one million people, but the government did not listen to our demands,"" said a 71-year-old woman in Hong Kong's Central district who only gave her name as Ponn. 
She brought her own plastic stool to join a cross-generational protest of a few hundred people at the city's Chater Garden. Elderly Hong Kongers, some with visors and canes, stood not far from young, black-clad protesters. All listened to pro-democracy speakers in a gathering marked by music and a festive mood.
""I have seen so much police brutality and unlawful arrests. This is not the Hong Kong I know. I came today because I want the government to know that we are not happy with what they have done to our generation,"" said Ponn, who attended with her daughter and son-in-law.
'FIVE DEMANDS'
Demonstrators are angered by what they see as Chinese interference in freedoms promised when Britain returned Hong Kong to Beijing in 1997. 
Although the protests were sparked by an extradition bill that was later scrapped, demonstrators have been making ""five demands"" that include universal suffrage in choosing the city's leader and an independent inquiry into police use of force. 
China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place in the Asian financial hub in 1997. It has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
People gathered on Saturday to pay their respects at a vigil outside the Prince Edward rail station where some residents believe that protesters were killed by police three months ago. Police have denied that account.
Some in the crowd shouted ""revenge"" and ""five demands"".
""They need to release the full CCTV footage of that night,"" said D. Wong, a 19-year-old protester holding up his laptop that was playing a film about perceived police brutality.
In the Kowloon Bay area, a few hundred protesters formed a line and stood side by side, holding hands.
On Saturday, citing authorities, the Communist party newspaper of the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou said police had arrested a Belize citizen for allegedly colluding with people in the United States to meddle in Hong Kong affairs.
The Hong Kong city government is looking into setting up an independent committee to review the handling of the crisis, Matthew Cheung, Chief Secretary for Administration, told reporters when asked about an independent review committee.
Some critics on social media have said that such a committee would fall short of the independent investigation they have been demanding.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, also called for an investigation into allegations of excessive police force.
""I appeal the government to take important confidence-building measures, including a proper independent and impartial judge-led investigation into reports of excessive use of force by the police,"" Bachelet wrote in an opinion piece in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper on Saturday.
'GLORY TO HONG KONG'
At Saturday's first rally, the crowd in the park rose at one point to sing ""Glory to Hong Kong"", which has become the unofficial anthem of protests. Many of them put their hands in the air with five fingers outstretched, a symbol of the pro-democracy movement.
""It has been quiet after the district elections and that is unexpected,"" senior citizen protester Ponn's 26-year-old daughter told Reuters. ""We should not stop there, I came today because we have to keep fighting.""
Some of the young protesters waved American flags, a sign of appreciation after U.S. President Donald Trump this week signed into law bills that back the protesters and threaten China with possible sanctions on human rights.
A 70-year-old retiree in a blue aviator sunglasses and a gray tracksuit, who gave his name as Ko, said seniors could offer guidance to the younger protesters.
""Starting from day one I have been involved in this movement and there is no reason to stop now,"" said Ko. 

""Today is a cross-age group meeting and there are a lot of middle school students ... We are here to give them advice and moral support. I think they need it.""

The marches, organized by the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), attracted over 10,000 people across several cities.
They are the biggest public show of strength so far by pro-government groups in response to weekly mass protests which erupted in February, when hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets to demand that the ruling hierarchy quit power and the army step back from politics.
Pressure from the protesters forced veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika from power in April and the authorities detained dozens of senior figures on corruption charges.
However, tens of thousands of people have continued to march weekly to demand a more thorough purge of the ruling elite. The army, the most powerful institution in Algeria, has pushed for the December 12 presidential election as the only way to end the crisis.
Protesters have rejected the vote, saying it cannot be free or fair so long as the old guard remains in power.
Saturday’s gatherings were a counter to the protests, with pro-government backers holding up banners reading, ""Vote for Algeria"" and ""We are united forever"".
There were also chants of ""The people and the army are brothers"", and ""We are with Gaed"", a reference to Army chief Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah who has been singled out during the mass protests, with many slogans calling for him to follow Bouteflika and step aside.
""I urge all Algerians to head for polling stations,’’ said bank employee Ahmed Kaci, who joined a march in Algiers. ``This is the only solution to our crisis."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The 28-year-old British man who killed two people in a stabbing spree on London Bridge before police shot him dead had been released from prison after a previous conviction for terrorism offenses, prompting political recriminations ahead of an election.
Wearing a fake suicide vest and wielding knives, Usman Khan went on the rampage on Friday afternoon at a conference on criminal rehabilitation beside London Bridge. He was wrestled to the ground by bystanders and then shot dead by police.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who faces a snap election on Dec. 12, said it was a terrorist attack and vowed to end a practice whereby serious offenders can be automatically let out of prison early, as the opposition attacked the policy. 
Khan, whose family is from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, was convicted in 2012 for his part in an al-Qaeda-inspired plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange. He was released in December 2018 subject to conditions.
""This individual was known to authorities, having been convicted in 2012 for terrorism offenses,"" Britain's top counter-terrorism police officer, Neil Basu, said in a statement. ""Clearly, a key line of inquiry now is to establish how he came to carry out this attack.""
Two people - a man and a woman - were killed in the attack, which took place days before London is due to host NATO leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump. A man and two women were injured and remain in hospital, Basu said.
Police searched an address in Stafford, central England, as they continued their investigation.
The opposition Labour Party criticized the government's record on crime.
""There are big questions that need to be answered,"" London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the most senior opposition politician in Britain in a position of power, told Sky News.
""One of the important tools judges had when it came to dealing with dangerous, convicted criminals... was their ability to give an indeterminate sentence to protect the public,"" he said. ""(That) was taken away from them by this government."" 
ELECTION ATTACK
During the 2017 election campaign, London Bridge was the scene of an attack when three militants drove a van into pedestrians and then attacked people in the surrounding area, killing eight people and injuring at least 48.
Islamic State said its fighters were responsible for that attack, but the British authorities have cast doubt on those claims. The 2017 attack focused attention on cuts to policing since the governing Conservatives took power in 2010.
Johnson said sentencing rules needed to be toughened up. 
""I have long said that this system simply isn't working,"" he said after visiting the scene of the attack. 
""It does not make sense for us, as a society, to be putting people convicted of terrorist offenses, serious violent offenses, out on early release."" 
The Conservatives defended an independent decision taken a few weeks ago to lower Britain's terrorism threat level.
Friday's attack, just 13 days before an election that could decide the fate of Britain's exit from the European Union, prompted political leaders to scale back campaigning.
The campaign so far has focused on Brexit and the health service but is likely to include crime over the coming days as the Conservatives seek to minimize the fallout from the incident. 
Queen Elizabeth sent her sympathies to those affected by the attack and praised those who intervened to thwart the assailant. 

""I express my enduring thanks to the police and emergency services, as well as the brave individuals who put their own lives at risk to selflessly help and protect others,"" she said.

The wood piece, just a few centimeters (inches) long, was once kept in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. It was handed over earlier this week to the custodian of the Bethlehem church, who said it brought ""great honor to believers and pilgrims in the area"".
The provenance of ancient relics is often questionable. Still, they are revered by the Christian faithful, among them the coachloads of pilgrims who squeeze through a narrow sandstone entrance in the Church of the Nativity to visit the birth grotto that is its centerpiece.
According to the Custos of the Holy Land for the Catholic church, Francesco Patton, the relic dates back more than 2,000 years and was sent to the Vatican in the 7th century.
Encased in a silver-colored ornamental table-top stand, the relic was unveiled to the public on Friday at the Notre Dame of Jerusalem Center, before it was taken to Bethlehem on Saturday.
A procession of marching bands greeted the relic as it arrived in Bethlehem. It was placed in Saint Catherine's Church, at the Church of the Nativity compound in Manger Square (NYSE:SQ).
""We are proud that part of the manger is back in Bethlehem because we feel that the soul of God is with us more than before,"" said Chris Gacaman, 53, a Bethlehem homemaker, as she stood outside the church.
Others were a little let down.
""It's a small piece, we thought it would be a bigger piece,"" said Sandy Shahin Hijazeen, 32. ""When we heard that the manger is coming back we thought it would be the whole manger, but then we saw it.""

BRUNSWICK, Germany (Reuters) - Hundreds of people rallied on Saturday in protest against the far-right Alternative for Germany in the western German city of Brunswick where the AfD gathered to elect new leaders.
Riot police fenced off the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Halle sports venue hosting some 550 AfD delegates to keep leftist protesters waving rainbow flags and banners reading ""Against the AfD and its incitement"" from reaching the building.
Party co-leader Alexander Gauland said in an opening speech that the AfD's goal was to move from the opposition to government, at least at the regional level.
The AfD is the biggest opposition party in the Bundestag national parliament, which it entered for the first time in 2017, propelled by voters angry at conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to admit almost one million mainly Muslim asylum seekers.
The AfD also sits on opposition benches in all of Germany's 16 state parliaments, where it is ostracized by all established parties, including Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).
""They call us Nazis, fascists and right-wing terrorists,"" said Gauland. ""But we need to be wise and resilient. The day will come when a weakened CDU has only one option: us.""
Merkel's conservatives have said they cannot work with the party, saying its anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic rhetoric contributes to an atmosphere of hate that encourages political violence.
Gauland, 78 and seen as a unifying figure in the AfD, has indicated he might run again for the leadership if he doubts the quality of the candidates.
His leadership partner, European Parliament lawmaker Joerg Meuthen, who is seeking re-election, echoed aspirations to prepare the party for a possible role in government.
""We need to make ourselves ready to govern,"" said Meuthen. ""It is not going to happen in 2019 or in 2020. But is going to happen.""
The party has said it wants to continue with the co-leadership model.
Tino Chrupalla, a lawmaker from the eastern state of Saxony, is the candidate favored by senior AfD members. He also has the backing of Bjoern Hoecke, AfD leader in the eastern state of Thuringia who leads a radical wing within the party that is under surveillance by the domestic intelligence agency for possible unconstitutional activities.
""If we want more success we need to change,"" Chrupalla said on Friday during a reception. ""We want to move toward the center. This will work because the CDU keeps moving to the left.""
The AfD won around a fourth of votes in elections in three eastern states this year. The party is more popular in former Communist eastern states, with double the support that it has in the west of the country.
Chrupalla's main challenger is lawmaker Gottfried Curio, a physicist and musician, whose rhetoric against Muslims has turned him into a YouTube star with almost 52,000 followers."
1263,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2019 06:48AM ET</span>",Protesters burn tires in southern Iraq in renewed anti-government rage,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Protesters burned tires and surrounded a police station in the southern Iraqi city of Nassiriya on Saturday, a Reuters witness said, pressing their demands for sweeping reform despite the prime minister promising to quit.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi announced his resignation on Friday after a call from Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric for the government to step down to end weeks of deadly unrest.
The unrest, which has killed more than 400 people, mostly demonstrators, amounts to the biggest crisis confronting Iraq since Islamic State insurgents seized vast swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory in 2014.
It pits mostly young, disaffected Shi'ite protesters against a Shi'ite-dominated government backed by Iran and accused of squandering Iraq's oil wealth while infrastructure and living standards deteriorate.
Security forces have used live ammunition, tear gas and stun grenades against protesters for nearly two months. Scores of the more than 400 dead have been killed in recent days, particularly in the southern cities of Nassiriya and Najaf.
At a funeral procession for protesters killed this week in Najaf, a Shi'ite holy city, a mourner who declined to give his name said: ""This man was protesting holding an Iraqi flag and a flower. He was shot dead. He's a sacrifice for the nation.""
Iraq's cabinet approved Abdul Mahdi's resignation, a statement from his office said on Saturday, but parliament has yet to withdraw its support for the prime minister at a session on Sunday, making it official.
""The government has done all it can to respond to the demands of protesters and enact reforms ... and calls the parliament to find solutions (to unrest) in its coming session,"" the statement said.
Iraqi protesters have welcomed the resignation but say it is not enough. They demand the overhaul of a political system they say is corrupt and keeps them in poverty and without opportunity.
Populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has supported protests but not thrown his full weight behind them, said late on Friday that demonstrations should continue.
FAMILIES MOURN DEAD
""The next candidate for prime minister should be chosen by popular referendum and picked from among five proposed candidates,"" Sadr suggested in a statement on Twitter. He said protesters should meanwhile press their demands but reject violence.
The burning by demonstrators of the Iranian consulate in Najaf on Wednesday escalated unrest and led to Abdul Mahdi's resignation. In Nassiriya, deadly clashes erupted on Thursday hours after the torching of the Najaf consulate.
Nassiriya was the scene of the worst violence to hit war-weary Iraq since anti-government protests began in Baghdad on Oct. 1. 
Many Iraqis fear violence will continue to escalate as angry families mourn dead relatives and the government moves slowly to enact only limited reform.
Weeks of political wrangling are expected before a successor to Abdul Mahdi is picked and a new government formed.
Iraq's semi-official Human Rights Commission said on Saturday those responsible for the killings of protesters must be brought to justice and that it would gather evidence for prosecution.
A statement issued by the commission did not acknowledge the prime minister's resignation.

The International Committee of the Red Cross urged a halt to rising casualties. ""Firearms and live ammunition must only be used as a last resort,"" it said in a statement.

Investigators were keeping ""all scenarios open"" on the perpetrator's identity and motive, police spokeswoman Marije Kuiper said.
The people injured were discharged from hospital late on Friday.
Police have not released any information about the suspect's appearance, but said an initial description of him as a man in his 40's was wrong.
National broadcaster NOS quoted two eyewitnesses as saying two of the victims, both girls, had run screaming from the street into a nearby store. One said an ""athletic"" man fled the scene, jumping easily over obstacles.

The oldest party in Germany is in turmoil after a run of dismal regional and European election results and a six-month long leadership race which has left them trailing in polls. Many members want to leave government and rebuild in opposition.
That, however, could trigger a snap election or a minority government - unappealing options for both the SPD and conservatives. After 14 years of leading Germany, home of Europe's biggest economy, Merkel has said she will not run again.
The SPD will announce the result of a 10-day ballot of its roughly 426,000 members at about 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) and delegates are set to approve the choice at a party conference on Dec. 6-8 where they will also vote on the coalition.
Two pairs of candidates are running on joint tickets and the choice boils down to whether members want to stick with the grand coalition or rethink.
The best-known candidate and probably frontrunner is Olaf Scholz, finance minister and deputy chancellor, a centrist criticized by the left of his party for following his former conservative predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble's fiscal caution.
With the backing of the SPD establishment and lawmakers, he and his little known running mate Klara Geywitz want to continue in the coalition.
Challenging them is Norbert Walter-Borjans, a former regional finance minister, nicknamed Robin Hood for cracking down on tax dodgers with secret Swiss bank accounts.
He and his leftist running mate Saskia Esken are highly critical of the coalition and say they want to renegotiate the 2018 coalition deal with more focus on social justice and investment - if necessary with a budget deficit.
If the conservatives refuse, Esken has said she would recommend walking out of government.
The winner faces a mammoth task. In 2017, the SPD's share of the vote slumped to its lowest level since 1933. It is now around 15% in polls, trailing the Greens and conservatives and only just ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)."

Beneath the birthday bonhomie, tensions will be simmering as the transatlantic military alliance turns 70 and leaders of the 29 member states celebrate near London on Dec. 3-4.
U.S. President Donald Trump's gripes about having to ""subsidize"" Europe is forcing it to contribute more, while French president Emmanuel Macron has ruffled feathers by calling NATO ""brain dead"" and suggesting a ""strategic relationship"" with Russia.
Expect heated debate over Turkey's threat to vote against a defense plan for the Baltics and Poland unless NATO recognizes the Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists. Unlikely, given the YPG helped defeat Islamic State. So how do they pacify Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan while keeping the YPG on side?
And summit host Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hope Trump does not wade into the British election, which could be exploited by the opposition. Johnson seems assured of a majority and will not want to take chances just a week before polling.
As for NATO's future role, the summit is will ask a group of ""wise persons"" to come up with suggestions, but they won't report until the next summit in late-2021.

2/ CARNIVAL OF DISCONTENT
South American leaders of the MERCOSUR trade bloc gathering in Brazil's Bento Gonçalvea on Thursday to discuss tariffs won't be short of talking points.
Waves of violent protest and social discontent sweeping across Latin America have already brought down Bolivia's government and pushed currencies from Chile to Colombia to record lows while showing little sign of abating.
Brazil has so far avoided such unrest but its currency, the real, is at record lows, forcing authorities to intervene. Chile's central bank is selling dollars amid the worst month for the peso since 2011 and an interest rate cut that was priced for December may now be in doubt.
There is no sign of relief for Venezuela where the economy is contracting at double-digit rates. Finally, popular discontent has helped elect a center-left president in Argentina who will have to deal with a suffocating debt burden.

3/ PAY DAY
U.S. job creation has slowed this year, running around 167,000 per month, a quarter below the 2018 average. Still there's no real sign that unemployment rates, near a 50-year low, are set to rise significantly. Non-farm payrolls, due on Dec. 6 are forecast to show 183,000 jobs were created in November, rebounding from October's 128,000. Though the October figures were likely skewed by a workers' strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM).
A forecast-beating number could further boost Wall Street where stocks have repeatedly hit record highs. But markets are on the look out for any signs of weakness; after all, labor markets are ""not that strong everywhere"", UBS economists note, pointing to pockets of manufacturing and agriculture weakness.

4/ PAIN MANAGERS INDEX
Manufacturing surveys will offer a checkup on Asia's trade-war wounds, with the consensus forecast for a seventh straight month of shrinking factory activity in China, pressured by sluggish domestic demand and limp exports.
But the devil lurks in the detail. Caixin's PMI, a separate survey with a focus on smaller businesses, is expected to show a fourth straight month of expansion, which would leave a picture that looks increasingly like a two-speed economy.
Big industry, dominated by lumbering state enterprises is shrinking, while private juggernauts such as Tencent,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and smaller e-commerce firms are soaring. Yet economic planners are biding their time, perhaps wary of creating a 2015-style runaway gravy train. While moves to ease monetary policy have so far been tentative, the PMIs may provide an additional push.

5/ BIG OIL'S BIG DAY
Dec. 5 is shaping up to be a big day for oil markets. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) gathers for a policy meeting and the same day, OPEC's biggest producer Saudi Arabia will give the final pricing for the IPO of state oil firm Aramco.
The IPO will be the elephant in the OPEC meeting room because the oil price at the time will be key to the listing, expected in mid-December.
A year ago, OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed to lower crude supply by 1.2 million barrels per day to prop up prices in the face of slowing oil demand. In July they extended that deal until March 2020.
Seasoned OPEC-watchers know never to exclude the possibility of a surprise decision but sources within the group seem pretty sure the supply-cut pact will be extended further into 2020. After all, an oil price tumble is something the Saudis won't want to risk just as the Aramco shares list.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A group of about 50 New Zealand firearm owners protested further gun reforms on Saturday, sounding a note of discord over the tightening of the country's gun laws after the mass shooting in Christchurch in March that killed 51 Muslim worshippers.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's efforts on gun control have gained global praise, but at home - with a general election next scheduled for year - she has faced resistance from the federal opposition National Party, gun lobby groups and ordinary citizens over planned legislation introduced in September.
On Saturday, the group of firearms owners staged a protest at a gun buy-back event in Auckland, according to media reports, carrying placards bearing slogans including ""This bill hurts ordinary Kiwis!"" and ""Be safe: reject arms bill"".
The new legislation now moving through parliament would create a gun register and tighten vetting of owners, among other changes. In April parliament passed nearly unanimously laws curbing the use and circulation of most semi-automatic firearms.
Stuff.nz, a New Zealand news website, cited Victoria O'Brien, a national shooting champion, as saying that guns being bought back and destroyed had cultural significance.
""There is a desecration of New Zealand history going on – we're talking World War I, World War II guns,"" O'Brien was cited as saying.
""We want them to stop and actually target the illegal possession of firearms,"" she said, urging the government to put reforms on hold."
1269,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 11:50PM ET</span>",From a box to a coffin: The long and deadly road home for Vietnamese migrants,"By James Pearson, Khanh Vu and Phuong Nguyen
HANOI (Reuters) - They left Vietnam carrying dreams of small fortunes and the heavy burden of family expectations.
But they died in a box, and came home in coffins.
For the 39 migrants who set off from one of the poorest parts of the Southeast Asian country in search of work in Britain, the promise of riches outweighed the risks of the perilous journey through Latvian forests and Belgian streets, to the oxygen-starved truck container in which they met their fate.
The bodies were discovered in late October, in the back of a refrigerated lorry, just outside London.
On Saturday, the last bodies were repatriated to Vietnam.
Here are the stories of three of the victims.
THE LOST BOY
Teenager Nguyen Huy Hung had longed to see his parents, both of whom had left Vietnam to find work in Britain's nail salons.
""It should have been a family reunion,"" said a neighbor who declined to be identified. ""His parents reached Britain safely and smoothly. They'd already paid smugglers to arrange his trip.
""He was too young to suffer from tragedy"".
Hung was one of two 15-year-old victims. Raised in a small fishing village in Ha Tinh province, rooms in the family home had been rented out because most of his family, apart from Hung's grandparents, had already relocated overseas for work.
Hung flew from Hanoi to Russia on August 26, his sister, who works in South Korea, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post days after news of the incident emerged.
By October 6, he was in France, she wrote, but they lost contact on October 21, two days before the container was found.
The family had paid 10,000 pounds ($12,900) to get him to Europe, his sister told Reuters. They were due to pay more money to people smugglers in Vietnam once he reached Britain, she added.
Hung's body was repatriated on Saturday.
But with no documentation and their hopes of being reunited with their son in Britain shattered, Hung's parents will miss his funeral.
THE CARPENTER
    Rudimentary dumbbells made from rusted iron and mossy lumps of concrete are some of the few objects Nguyen Dinh Gia has to remind him of his son.
    Luong was an honest boy, Gia said. At 20, Luong didn't drink, he didn't smoke, and he had never had a girlfriend.
    Luong loved sports, and his ramshackle weights. In October 2017, he left Ha Tinh province and found work in a nearby province as a carpenter, a skill he learned from his brother.
    ""He didn't try to get into university,"" Gia said. ""Not many children around here do"".
From there, Luong traveled to Hanoi where he boarded a flight to Russia.
He stayed there until April 2018, when he drifted to Ukraine where he spent his nights with other migrants in a warehouse. He would contact his father sometimes, Gia said.
""I felt comfortable knowing he was safe, living there"".
Weeks later, Luong left for Germany. He moved by road, but he walked for seven hours too. ""It was a one-day journey and everyone with him was Vietnamese,"" Gia said.
There, Luong begged his father to pay for him to go to France, where he stayed until this October, when he decided to join friends working in Britain.
""I tried to persuade him not to go,"" said Gia. ""I told him the money he had earned in France was huge for the family.""
Gia had paid $18,000 to people smugglers to get his son that far. A few days before he boarded the doomed truck, Luong called home.
Gia said he was in good spirits.
    Luong's body was repatriated on Wednesday and he was buried on Thursday.
""After waiting for so many days, my son has finally arrived,"" said Gia.                      
THE DREAMER
Bui Thi Nhung had been dreaming of Europe.
She hoped to be reunited with her boyfriend, in Britain.
Her Facebook posts in the days before she died showed her in Brussels, where she drank bubble tea on the steps of the old stock exchange.
Like the other two, she flew from Vietnam to Russia, then crossed into Latvia. From there she moved to Lithuania, then Poland, Germany, and Belgium, friends and neighbors told Reuters.
It wasn't her first attempt.
""My life is full of ups and downs. I want to fly to Europe, but I can't,"" she wrote, four months earlier.
""I don't want to stay home, marry young and live penniless,"" Nhung told friends who had suggested she stay in Vietnam and raise cattle instead.
""I'll try my luck next time"".
According to her friends, Nhung first wanted to find work in Germany, and spent a year in Vietnam learning to paint nails. ""A girl has to have a job otherwise no one will marry her,"" she wrote.
On her third try, Nhung finally made it to Europe. The trip ended in disaster.
""I'm about to start a new journey,"" Nhung wrote to friends a few days before they lost contact with her.
Nhung's friends have memorialized her Facebook page to keep her stories alive. Many of her friends are scattered overseas, working in Europe's nail bars.
""Please don't blame us,"" one of her friends told Reuters.
""Don't blame the 39 victims in the back of the truck"".
Nhung made her final journey home on Saturday.
She was 19 years old."

Geingob, Namibia's third leader since the sparsely populated and mostly arid country freed itself from the shackles of apartheid South Africa in 1990, was seeking a second and final term in the Nov. 27 election.
His SWAPO party is contending with an economy in recession for nearly three years, one of Namibia's worst droughts and its biggest corruption scandal - all of which conspired to make the vote unexpectedly tough for Geingob.
He faced nine challengers including Panduleni Itula, a dentist-turned-politician who is a SWAPO member but running as an independent. Itula is popular with young people, nearly half of whom are unemployed.
With 62.3% of the vote countered so far, presidential results from 76 out of 121 constituencies showed that Geingob was on track to retain office despite a dwindling support base in urban areas.
Geingob, who was first elected in 2014 with 87% of the vote, has so far garnered 56.9% of the votes counted, followed by Itula with 28.34%, while the leader of the official opposition party, McHenry Venaani, was in third position with 5.04%.
In legislative voting for 96 members of parliament, SWAPO has garnered 65.21% of the vote with 53.28% of the ballots counted, while Venaani's Popular Democratic Movement (PDM) has secured 15.73%.
A SWAPO victory could be disputed after a court threw out a case mounted by the opposition against the use of electronic voting machines it fears would be used to cheat."

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's human rights prosecutor on Friday indicted another former top military official for genocide and crimes against humanity committed during the bloodiest phase of the Central American country's 36-year civil war.
A military operations chief under deceased Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt, Luis Enrique Mendoza Garcia will be tried in March for his role in an operation in the early 1980s that killed at least 1,771 Maya Ixil and displaced thousands.
Judge Jimmy Bremer on Friday formally received the charges the prosecutors presented against the 76-year-old in a court in Guatemala City.
Mendoza Garcia is the fourth top military official facing justice in less than a week after Benedicto Lucas Garcia, Manuel Callejas and Cesar Noguera were indicted in a separate case of genocide against the same community.
""I was not the one who ruled,"" Mendoza Garcia said in a declaration given by video conference, adding that he had had no means to plan or carry out such an operation. Reuters was unable to contact the accused, all of whom have denied the allegations.
Mendoza Garcia was captured six months ago after having been on the run since 2011. Guatemala's human rights prosecutor said there were more victims and witnesses who could testify against him than in other processes.  
Former military intelligence chief Jose Mauricio Rodriguez was acquitted last year of charges of genocide and crimes against humanity after the court said it had insufficient evidence.
During the civil war, from 1960 to 1996, an estimated 200,000 mostly Mayan civilians were killed and another 45,000 went missing.
Rios Montt, who ruled during the war's bloodiest phase, between 1982 and 1983, died in April last year. At that time, he was facing renewed charges after his conviction for genocide and crimes against humanity was overturned.
Lucas Garcia is the brother of former president Romeo Lucas Garcia. Guatemala's human rights prosecutor accuses him of having planned one of the operations in the Maya Ixil region some 225km northwest of the capital.
Separately on Friday, Guatemalan President-elect Alejandro Giammattei regretted the decision of a Swiss court to uphold a 15-year prison sentence for Swiss-Guatemalan Erwin Sperisen for his role in a 2006 prison operation.
Giammattei himself faced accusations of human rights violations for the same incident, during which seven prisoners but no government officials died; he was later exonerated for lack of evidence.
""An act of injustice,"" Giammattei said. ""I would have liked to testify in the case."" Sperisen's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment but told local media they would take the case to the European Court of Human Rights."

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian opposition leader Keiko Fujimori walked free from prison on Friday night after being jailed for more than a year pending a trial over allegations she accepted illegal campaign contributions from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht.
Fujimori, leader of the powerful right-wing Popular Force party, left prison in the Chorrillos district of capital city Lima, according to a Reuters witness at the scene where hundreds of supporters gathered outside in anticipation of her release.
Fujimori was met by her husband outside the prison with flowers and balloons. Others supporters carried the orange banners of her political party.
The country's Constitutional Tribunal, Peru's top court, ordered her release on Monday after she was handed an 18-month pre-trial sentence in October last year.
""I have lived though the most painful moment of my life,"" Fujimori told reporters, adding the decision to release her ""corrected a process full of abuse and arbitrariness"".
Prosecutors allege she led a criminal organization and received millions of dollars from Odebrecht, which is at the center of a region-wide corruption scandal. Fujimori denies the accusations.
Fujimori is the daughter of Peru's ex-President Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes and graft.
Her release comes as Peru prepares for legislative elections in January after President Martin Vizcarra dissolved Congress amid a battle with opposition lawmakers over his anti-corruption campaign. Keiko Fujimori's party had held a majority in Congress before its dissolution.
The far-reaching Odebrecht scandal has swept through Peruvian politics. Earlier this year, former president Alan Garcia killed himself to avoid arrest in the probe. A number of other former presidents are also under investigation.
Fujimori, who still faces an eventual trial on the corruption allegations, said she would continue to cooperate with Peru's judiciary. She added she would look to spend time with her family before making decisions on any other plans.
""Later I will decide what I will do in the second stage of my life,"" she said. ""I have had the opportunity to reflect and also realize there have been things I could have done better."""

HANOI (Reuters) - The remains of 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a truck near London last month have been brought to Vietnam, bringing to a close a tragic saga that has devastated rural communities in the Southeast Asian country.
The remains of 23 victims arrived at Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi early on Saturday, a local government official said. Seven of the bodies were cremated in Britain before being repatriated, the official Vietnam News Agency said.
The first 16 of the bodies were repatriated on Wednesday to their home towns in northern-central Vietnam, where they were received by relatives and friends holding white roses.
The discovery of the bodies in the back of a refrigerated truck after being smuggled into Britain has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.
Police in Vietnam have arrested 10 people in connection with the deaths. On Monday, the British driver of the truck admitted plotting to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property.
In Vietnam, poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial rewards are all factors pushing people to leave.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's top attorneys agreed on Friday to standardize laws across the country forcing priests to report child abuse revealed to them during confessions in a move that could widen a schism between the church and the government. 
Federal and state attorneys-general agreed on key principles for the laws, which fall under the responsibility of state and territory governments and which address the most contentious recommendations from a government inquiry into child abuse.
With half of the country's population identifying themselves as Christian, Australia has faced a crisis of faith amid worldwide allegations that churches and religious leaders had protected pedophile priests and habitually covered sexual abuse. 
""Confessional privilege cannot be relied upon to avoid a child protection or criminal obligation to report beliefs, suspicions or knowledge of child abuse,"" according to a communique published after the attorneys meeting. 
In addition, priests would not be able to use a ""confessional privilege"" defense to avoid giving evidence against a third party in criminal or civil proceedings.
Although most states have already been working on such laws, the unified position would implement a nationwide standard - but could also lead to a widening rift between the church and the government in a country that adheres to a secular constitution.
Archbishop Mark Coleridge, president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, the country's top Catholic body, said the Catholic Church supports ""nationally consistent"" reporting regimes to protect children. 
However, he said, the church does not consider the removal of the legal protection for the ""sacramental seal of confession"" helpful or necessary.
""The removal of protections at law would be ineffective, counter-productive and unjust: ineffective because abusers do not seek out confession and certainly would not seek it out if they knew that their offences would be reported,"" Coleridge was cited as saying in a statement e-mailed to Reuters.
""Counter-productive because the rare opportunity a priest may have to counsel abusers to turn themselves in and amend their life would be lost; and unjust because it would establish as a matter of law a situation where a priest would not be able to defend himself against an accusation made against him.""
In 2017, Australia ended a five-year powerful government inquiry into institutional child sex abuse, which came up with 122 recommendations, including that Australia introduce a law forcing religions leaders to report child abuse. [REUTERSNEWS-T004/Id635fe00e15211e7acb4cd90b8c479ce]
Australia's Cardinal George Pell, who is appealing a conviction for sexually assaulting two teen-aged choir boys, has been so far the most senior Catholic official worldwide to be jailed for child sex offences.

SITIO PARIAHAN, Philippines (Reuters) - Danica Martinez, 16, grew up in a house that grows taller every few years.
Her father raises the stilts of their bamboo hut so water from the sea doesn't reach the floor. They live in Sitio Pariahan, a coastal village in the Philippines that was once an island, and is now without land. 
Sitio Pariahan, about 17 km (10.5 miles) north of Manila, is sinking about 4 cm (1.5 inches) every year, owing largely to land subsidence from the population's overuse of groundwater, according to experts.
Now rising sea levels caused by global warming could soon make this village unlivable, a problem faced by other countries in Asia, where the poorest communities are hardest hit.
A deep well is the only source of water, and residents use it to bathe, clean, cook and, sometimes, even to drink.
Solar panels are installed on many rooftops for electricity, mostly to watch television that's shared between neighbors. On days that power is low, residents pass the time by gambling.
Martinez remembers that their village wasn't always like this. She recalls basketball tournaments and grand feasts that their community once held, so popular that visitors from nearby towns would flock to watch performances, and celebrate mass at the church.
The court is now fully submerged, and the church that was once filled with devotees is stained with moss.
Much of the destruction happened when Typhoon Nesat struck in 2011, bringing waves Martinez said were as big as houses.
She saw how the huts were pulled into the sea, one by one, as she and her siblings held onto bamboo poles. Their school was also destroyed, and left only with walls. More than 50 families left and never returned.
Now, Martinez and her siblings take a 30-minute boat ride to school, sometimes with uniforms drenched by big waves.

National broadcaster NOS said the attack could not immediately be attributed to terrorism.
Police launched a manhunt after the attack, which took place on a busy shopping street near the city's historic center. The area was cordoned off and dozens of police and ambulances were on the scene.
All the victims were minors and were treated in hospital before being discharged, police said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - British police on Friday shot dead a man wearing a fake suicide vest who stabbed two people to death in London and wounded three more before being wrestled to the ground by bystanders, in what the authorities called a terrorist attack.
The attacker went on the rampage just before 2 p.m. (1400 GMT), targeting people at Fishmongers' Hall near London Bridge in the heart of the city's financial district - the scene of a deadly attack by Islamist militants two years ago.
The Times newspaper, citing unnamed government sources, reported that the man had previously been convicted of an Islamist terrorism-related offence and was released from prison about a year ago after agreeing to wear an electronic tag.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sentences should be served.
""It is a mistake to allow serious and violent criminals to come out of prison early, and it is very important that we get out of that habit and that we enforce the appropriate sentences for dangerous criminals, especially for terrorists,"" he said.
Once the attacker was out on the street, a dramatic video posted on Twitter captured the moment when half a dozen bystanders tackled the suspect on London Bridge and grabbed his knife.
The video showed police dragging one man off the suspect before an officer took careful aim. Two shots rang out. The man stopped moving.
Johnson, who has called a snap election for Dec. 12 and is due to host NATO leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump next week, praised those who took on the man for their courage and said Britain would never be cowed.
""I ... want to pay tribute to the extraordinary bravery of those members of the public who physically intervened to protect the lives of others,"" Johnson told reporters in Downing Street.
""For me they represent the very best of our country and I thank them on behalf of all of our country,"" Johnson said. ""This country will never be cowed, or divided, or intimidated by this sort of attack.""
He said the incident was now thought to have been contained and vowed that anyone else involved would be hunted down. He later chaired a meeting of the government's emergency security committee.
Britain's top counter-terrorism officer, Neil Basu, said specialist armed officers from the City of London police shot the suspect, who died at the scene. He said a hoax explosive device was strapped to his body.
""Our Counter Terrorism detectives will be working round the clock to identify those who have lost their lives, to support all the victims and their families,"" London police chief Cressida Dick told reporters.
""We are also working at full tilt to understand exactly what has happened and whether anyone else was involved.""
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson's main opponent in the election, said he was shocked by the incident and that his thoughts were with those caught up in it.
Campaigning has been temporarily suspended.
KICKED IN THE HEAD
Commissioner Dick said the attacker launched his assault at Fishmongers' Hall, a grand building at the northern end of the bridge.
One of those who confronted the attacker there told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that he had kicked him in the head to make him drop the knife.
Stevie Hurst, who gives tours of the capital, said he and a colleague took on the suspect with about five others.
""I jumped in and kicked him in the head to make him release his knife. A few others did so,"" he told the Telegraph. ""He was shouting 'get off me, get off me'.""
As three armed police officers circled the suspect in the shadow of the Shard skyscraper, western Europe's tallest building, one bystander in a suit and tie grabbed the knife and swiftly retreated as police engaged.
The city's mayor Sadiq Khan said ordinary Londoners had demonstrated ""breath-taking heroism"" in disarming the knife-wielding attacker despite him having a device which they did not know to be a hoax.
""What's remarkable about the images we've seen is the breath-taking heroism of members of the public who literally ran towards danger not knowing what confronted them,"" Khan told reporters.
The ambulance service declared a ""major incident"" in the area and London Bridge station, a busy commuter hub, was closed for a number of hours.
PREVIOUS ATTACKS
During the 2017 election campaign, London Bridge was the scene of an attack when three militants drove a van into pedestrians and then attacked people in the surrounding area, killing eight and injuring at least 48.
Islamic State said its fighters were responsible, but the British authorities have cast doubt on those claims.
The month before, a suicide bomber killed 22 children and adults and wounded 59 at a packed concert hall in the English city of Manchester, as crowds began leaving a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande.
In March the same year, an attacker stabbed a policeman close to London's parliament buildings after a car plowed into pedestrians on nearby Westminster Bridge.
Six people died, including the assailant and the policeman he stabbed, and at least 20 were injured in what police called a ""marauding terrorist attack"".
Earlier this month, Britain had lowered its national terrorism threat level to ""substantial"" from ""severe"", its lowest level since 2014."

North Korea fired two short-range projectiles into the sea off its east coast on Thursday in a fourth test of its new ""super-large multiple-rocker launcher,"" with its North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressing ""great satisfaction"" over the latest test.
In the wake of Pyongyang's firing, Abe said on Thursday that North Korea's missile launch was a threat to Japan and the international community, and that Tokyo would monitor the situation with its partners.
""It can be said that Abe is the only one idiot in the world and the most stupid man ever known in history as he fails to distinguish a missile from multiple launch rocket system while seeing the photo-accompanied report,"" the North's KCNA news agency said, citing a vice director general of the North Korean Foreign Ministry's Department of Japanese Affairs.
""Abe may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future and under his nose ... Abe is none other than a perfect imbecile and a political dwarf without parallel in the world.""
U.N. Security Council resolutions ban North Korea from firing ballistic missiles and using such technology, but North Korea rejects the restriction as an infringement of its right to self-defense.
In early November, Pyongyang criticized the Japanese prime minister after Tokyo said North Korea's test of what it called ""super-large multiple rocket launchers"" on Oct. 31 was likely ballistic missiles that violated U.N. sanctions."

PARAMARIBO (Reuters) - A court in Suriname on Friday convicted President Desi Bouterse of murder for the execution of 15 opponents in 1982 following a coup to seize power, sentencing the man who has dominated the former Dutch colony's recent history to 20 years in prison. 
Opposition parties called for Bouterse, currently in China on an official visit, to step down. The military court that found him guilty has not yet ordered his arrest. 
Bouterse led the South American country through the 1980s as head of a military government, then assumed office again in 2010 and secured re-election five years later.
The court ruled that Bouterse had overseen an operation in which soldiers under his command abducted 16 leading government critics - including lawyers, journalists and university teachers - from their homes and killed 15 of them at a colonial fortress in the capital Paramaribo.
One trade union leader survived and later gave testimony against Bouterse.
Bouterse, who has steadfastly denied the charges, is able to appeal the decision. So far he has made no comment on his conviction and he is expected to travel to Cuba, as planned, on Saturday.
In a statement, the Surinamese government said it had ""taken note of the developments and calls on the community to keep the peace.""
The Dutch government said it was important that the final verdict be upheld and implemented once the appeals process is complete. ""This is an important moment for determining the truth. After 37 years, the relatives have an answer,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said on Twitter.
Critics have vilified the 74-year-old Bouterse as a dictator who has clung to power in the country of 560,000 people, which gained independence from the Netherlands in 1975.
Angelic del Castillo, head of the opposition Democratic Alternative '91 party, said Bouterse had ""disqualified himself"" from remaining Suriname's leader and demanded he immediately resign. ""This is in the interest of the dignity of the office and of our nation,"" del Castillo said in a statement.
In 1999, Bouterse was convicted in absentia of drug trafficking by a court in the Netherlands, though he has denied any wrongdoing. A Suriname judge in 2005 convicted Bouterse's son, Dino, of leading a gang that trafficked in cocaine, illegal arms and stolen luxury cars.
As a junior military officer, Bouterse took part in the 1980 coup against Suriname's first prime minister, Henck Arron, and immediately promoted himself to army chief-of-staff, becoming effective ruler of the government.
Bouterse left the army in late 1992 and went into business and politics, heading the pro-military National Democratic Party (NDP) and remaining a prominent if controversial national figure.

Bouterse and the NDP have consistently tried to obstruct court proceedings, which began in 2007. In 2012, the NDP-controlled National Assembly passed an amnesty law giving him immunity but that was later invalidated by a court ruling.

VALETTA (Reuters) - A prominent Maltese businessman suspected of involvement in the killing of a journalist went to court on Friday and accused the prime minister's right-hand man of being implicated in the plot.
Yorgen Fenech, who is on police bail, also asked the court in Valetta to order the removal of Inspector Keith Arnaud, the chief investigator in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.
Caruana Galizia, a campaigning journalist who investigated and exposed corruption, was blown up by a car bomb in October 2017. The case has developed into a political crisis for the government of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat.
Lawyers for Fenech alleged that Schembri, who was Joseph Muscat's chief of staff until he resigned on Tuesday, has for the last two years leaked secret details of the probe to Fenech.
The lawyers told the court that audio recordings seized by police proved Fenech was privy to secret blow-by-blow details of Arnaud's inquiries.
Shaven-headed Fenech, who is currently on police bail, appeared in court flanked by his two lawyers but with no police escort, in a grey pin-striped suit and dark glasses, looking exhausted but calm.
Fenech's lawyer Marion Camillieri said the recording were recovered from Melvin Theuma. He was granted an official pardon this week in return for testifying that he acted as the middleman in passing a contract to three people already indicted for planting the bomb that killed Caruana Galizia.
Camillieri told the court the evidence, which included a photo of Theuma in Schembri's office, proved his involvement, despite the fact that Schembri was released on Thursday evening by police after being held since Tuesday morning.
""We are saying that although there is a lot of evidence against Keith Schembri...we have a recordings, a contract. And yet it was declared that he is no longer a person of interest,"" she said.
Camilieri said Inspector Arnaud was an associate of Schembri who had briefed him constantly on the case. She said Schembri organized a job for Arnaud's wife, an accusation denied by the Maltese government and police. 
""How can justice be done by Yorgen Fenech when we know that this person had a close relationship with the person investigating,"" Camillieri said.
Responding for the government, Victoria Buttigieg said it would be damaging to suspect Arnaud who ""knows the case inside out"".
His wife got no favors from Schembri and a suspect cannot dictate how an investigation is carried out. Buttigieg said.
""The dynamics of investigation are at the absolute discretion of the police,"" she said.
No country allowed a suspect to choose who investigated the case. She denied Arnaud's wife had been handpicked for a government job.
Reporters were excluded from part of the government's case to avoid disclosure of further sensitive details. Judgment by Justice Miriam Hayman will be delivered on Monday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. digital currency specialist living in Singapore has been arrested and criminally charged with helping North Korea use cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade American sanctions, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Virgil Griffith, 36, traveled to North Korea via China in April to attend the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference, despite being denied permission by the U.S. Department of State to go.
Griffith, who has a doctorate from the California Institute of Technology, gave a presentation on topics preapproved by North Korean officials, provided valuable technical information, and engaged in talks about using cryptocurrency technology to circumvent sanctions and launder money, prosecutors said.
A lawyer for Griffith did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.
Griffith was arrested on Thursday at Los Angeles International Airport, and charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which carries a maximum 20-year prison term.
Prosecutors said Griffith was expected to appear on Friday in Los Angeles federal court.
His case was announced one day after North Korea launched two short-range rockets off its eastern cost, ahead of a year-end deadline that Pyongyang had given the White House to show flexibility in stalled denuclearization talks.
""The consequences of North Korea obtaining funding, technology, and information to further its desire to build nuclear weapons put the world at risk,"" FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said in a statement.
""It's even more egregious that a U.S. citizen allegedly chose to aid our adversary,"" he added.
According to a criminal complaint, Griffith's presentation titled ""Blockchain and Peace"" described how blockchain technology including a ""smart contract"" could help North Korea.
Prosecutors said Griffith later started work on making it easier to move cryptocurrency between North Korea and South Korea and encouraged other U.S. citizens to travel to North Korea, including for the same cryptocurrency conference in 2020.
The complaint said a search this month of Griffith's cellphone with his consent uncovered an Aug. 6, 2019, message to an unnamed individual, known as Individual-2, indicating a need to send some cryptocurrency between North Korea and South Korea.
""Individual-2 asked, in sum and substance, 'Isn't that violating sanctions?' Griffith replied, 'it is,'"" the complaint said.
The case is U.S. v. Griffith, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-mag-10987."

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelans flocked to shopping centers in Caracas, the country's largest city, on Friday to take advantage of the first ""Black Friday"" discounts in recent memory, as socialist President Nicolas Maduro's government loosens controls in the face of an economic crisis.
For the first six holiday seasons of his presidency, Maduro attempted to keep consumer goods prices low despite galloping inflation with strict enforcement of price controls. This year, with the OPEC nation facing crippling U.S. sanctions on its oil industry, the government has left retailers more or less alone.
""My sister saw it on social media and said, 'Look, there are 70% discounts at the Sambil,' and we came running,"" said Elizabeth Diaz, a 42-year-old bank worker from the city of Los Teques some 35 km (22 miles) from Caracas' Sambil mall, where she was waiting in line outside a toy store to buy gifts for her three grandchildren.
""Discounts are the only way, because with prices through the roof one can't afford anything,"" she said.
Malls and small retailers across the country advertised discounts of up to 80% on goods from shoes to electronics, hoping an influx of Christmas shoppers could compensate for weak sales so far in Venezuela's sixth straight year of economic contraction.
In January, the government said it would make price controls more ""flexible"" and loosen a complex, longstanding system of currency controls. That has led to a wider circulation of foreign currency, as Venezuelans turn to the dollar to protect their earnings against a fast-devaluing local bolivar.
The reforms, however, have not revived the economy. Inflation in the nine months through September was 4,680% while commercial activity fell 39.2% in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, according to the most recent central bank data. A migration wave that has seen more than 4 million Venezuelans flee the country has continued unabated.
But the contours of Venezuela's economic crisis have shifted. While price controls once led to bare supermarket shelves and long lines, stores are now better stocked but with goods whose prices are far beyond the reach of those who earn the minimum wage of less than $10 per month.
""Sales are down 50% so far this year, so we decided to do Black Friday to get people excited and boost sales,"" said Rosmary Mogollon, 42, who works at a shoe store in Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city, which has been hard-hit by blackouts and gasoline shortages this year.
Stores in the western city of San Cristobal joined the rest of the country in offering discounts, but thousands of its residents streamed across the Colombian border to go shopping in the nearby city of Cucuta, where Black Friday has long been a mainstay.
But in the rest of the country, Reuters witnesses and retailers said attendance was above average for normally moribund shops - though a far cry from the frenzy often associated with the event elsewhere in the world.
""It's a way for people to forget about the gasoline lines and the whole crisis,"" said Maria Sakhr, who works at a toy store in the western city of Barquisimeto that was offering 20% discounts."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday he will not permit an armed foreign intervention a century after Mexico was last invaded, reflecting fears over U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to designate the country's drug cartels as terrorist groups. 
Designating groups as foreign terrorist organizations is aimed at disrupting their finances by imposing U.S. sanctions. While it does not directly give authority for overseas military operations, many Mexicans are nervous it could lead to unilateral U.S. action against gangs.
""Since 1914 there hasn't been a foreign intervention in Mexico and we cannot permit that,"" Lopez Obrador said at a news conference, referring to the U.S. occupation of the port of Veracruz 105 years ago. U.S. troops also entered Mexico in 1916, chasing revolutionary Pancho Villa after he killed U.S. citizens.
Trump has repeatedly offered military assistance to help combat the cartels, but Mexico has consistently declined the offer, even after the gangland massacre of a U.S.-Mexican family this month.
""Armed foreigners cannot intervene in our territory,"" Lopez Obrador said, instead offering more cooperation with the United States on fighting drug gangs, which have shown their power in a series of battles with security forces and civilians in recent months.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr will visit Mexico next week to discuss security cooperation, Mexico's foreign minister said earlier. The U.S. embassy in Mexico did not respond to a request for comment.
The growing pressure on criminal gangs comes after Trump this year forced Mexico's hand on immigration by threatening to impose tariffs on Mexican exports to the United States.
Lopez Obrador conceded to a U.S. initiative launched in January called the Migrant Protection Protocols that has forced nearly 59,000 migrants to wait in Mexico for their U.S. immigration court hearings.
He also sent the newly formed National Guard, created to tackle Mexico's spiraling gang-fueled violence, to Mexico's borders to help stop migrants from reaching U.S. soil.
While the two countries already work together extensively on combating cartels, some U.S. security officials have said they find it harder to work with Lopez Obrador's government, which took office a year ago. 
Gladys McCormick (NYSE:MKC), a security analyst at Syracuse University in New York, said she expected Lopez Obrador and Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard to ""put up more of a fight on this issue."" 

""Ebrard is waiting to hear from Barr on what precisely such a designation will entail for Mexico given the lack of details and precedent such designation carries,"" she said.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - After armed men raided the home of Hussein Adel al-Madani and his wife Sara Talib last year, the Iraqi activists spent months of self-imposed exile in Turkey, changed address upon returning home and ceased participating in protests, according to two friends of the couple.
But a day after anti-government demonstrations erupted in Baghdad in October, unidentified gunmen believed by activists to be working on behalf of Iran-backed militia shot the couple dead in their home in the southern city of Basra, said the friends and two security sources familiar with the incident. Sara was several months pregnant.
""It was a message. No matter who you are, how peacefully you object - if you go out and demonstrate, you'll be threatened, locked up, or killed,"" said one of the friends, an activist who gave the name Abbas, an alias, for fear of reprisal from armed groups.
Reuters interviews with five officials and more than half a dozen Iraqi rights activists depict a pattern of mass arrests, intimidation and torture, and in some cases targeted killings of Iraqi protesters.
On Friday, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi announced his resignation following weeks of protests calling for the removal of a government viewed as corrupt and the powerful Iran-backed paramilitary groups that support it. Iraqis say the resignation alone will not curb the power of corrupt officials or armed groups.
At least six activists have been shot dead in or near their homes over the past year in what appear to be targeted assassinations, according to activists and one government official. The official and the activists said they believed Iran-backed militia were behind the deaths because those killed had been openly critical of the militias and had also received threats based on their anti-government and anti-Iranian activism.
The number of targeted killings and details of intimidation tactics used in the crackdown have not previously been reported. Several activists say it amounts to what they view as a campaign intended to silence dissidents and is causing them to abandon protests or consider fleeing the country.
An Iranian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said accusations of killings and threats by militias Tehran supports were “baseless.”
Ahmed al-Asadi, a spokesman for the state umbrella grouping of paramilitary factions that include the biggest Iran-backed militias, could not be reached for comment. The body has previously denied any involvement in killing protesters and activists.
Iraqi government spokesman Saad al-Hadithi declined to comment on the assassination of activists.
Iraqi authorities say they have arrested and released some 2,500 protesters, with another 240 detained on criminal charges. More than 400 people have been killed since October during the biggest challenge to Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim-dominated, Iran-backed political class that emerged after a 2003 U.S.-led invasion which toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.
The protesters, many under the age of 30, represent a cross-section of society clamoring for an overhaul of the post-2003 political system, which they say has plundered the state’s resources including abundant oil and pushed ordinary people into poverty. They have become increasingly critical of Iran’s dominant role in the country.
According to two Iraqi security officials, it is not uncommon for those detained to be beaten, electrocuted and forced to sign pledges not to demonstrate or speak to media. Heads of Iraqi security services have given their forces operating in Iraq the green light to detain ""anyone they suspect of being a security threat or involved in inciting unrest,"" one of the Iraqi security officials said.
The Iraq government spokesman, al-Hadithi, denied that those detained had been tortured or subjected to violence, adding that the Justice Ministry and Supreme Judicial Council were overseeing the questioning of those arrested. He denied that security services or the military were detaining peaceful protesters.
If activists do have evidence of torture, it should be investigated, said Abdul Karim Khalaf, a government military and security spokesman. But, he added, “we have not had any confirmation of this happening.”
Iraqi authorities say some protesters have tried to incite violence after properties in Baghdad and the headquarters of several Iran-aligned parties in southern cities were burned. More than a dozen members of the security forces have been killed and scores injured in the unrest, authorities add.
Demonstrators on Thursday torched the Iranian consulate in the southern holy city of Najaf, the strongest expression yet of the anti-Iranian sentiment of Iraqi protesters as the gulf widens between a largely Iran-aligned ruling elite and an increasingly desperate Iraqi majority with few opportunities and minimal state support.
“POWERFUL MILITIA”
Hussein Adel al-Madani and his wife, aged 25 and 24, respectively, were among protesters who openly opposed the influence of Iran-backed militias that were made formally part of the armed forces after they helped the government defeat Islamic State in 2017.
Abbas, a close friend and former housemate of al-Madani, said the couple were among the first to protest last year in the southern city of Basra, and Sara was among the first women out on the streets.
""But they had to stop. Gunmen raided their home late in 2018 and asked them to write down names of other protesters,” he said, adding that the couple were accused of helping to burn and destroy Iran’s Basra consulate.
“They decided to leave for Turkey until things calmed down.""
The couple returned to Basra days before the latest wave of protests began on Oct. 1, the two security sources familiar with the incident said. Armed men broke into the home on Oct. 2, fatally shooting al-Madani twice in the chest and once in the head, and his wife once in the head, they said.
The security sources did not say who they believed killed the couple. An investigation into the deaths was being treated as a targeted killing by an unidentified armed group, they said. But they didn’t rule out other motives such as an honor killing by family members belonging to a militia who disapproved of their marriage.
""Investigators are working on the basis it was an organized armed group because it’s two victims who were activists and had been threatened,"" one of the two sources said.
The government official, asked whether Iran-backed militiamen had killed the couple to silence them, said: “A powerful militia threatened them, they fled and when they returned were killed. Everyone knows who did it, but doesn't dare say."" He didn’t specify which group.
Other protesters have died in circumstances that activists and some government officials say point the finger squarely at Iran-backed groups because the protesters had spoken out against them, but which are still under investigation.
Gunmen driving unmarked cars killed two other outspoken activists in November using silenced pistols in separate incidents in Baghdad and southern Amara, the two security officials said.
In the Baghdad incident, Adnan Rustum, 41, was shot dead returning from an anti-government protest in his neighborhood, which is dominated by one Iran-backed militia. Asked about whether Iran-backed militia were responsible, two local police sources said Rustum’s role in the protests was the reason he was killed but didn’t elaborate.
The Iraqi parliament’s human rights committee has demanded the government investigate ""assassinations and kidnappings"" of activists and bloggers, including Rustum’s death.
As previously reported by Reuters, Iran-backed militias deployed snipers on Baghdad rooftops during anti-government protests in October, according to two Iraqi security officials.
BEATEN, ELECTROCUTED
Four of the activists Reuters spoke to said they were arrested in the past year and two of those said they detained and beaten in recent weeks. They asked that their names not be published for fear of being targeted by security forces or militias.
One of those protesters described being arrested shortly after leaving a demonstration, beaten and electrocuted during 10 days of detention.
""They asked me to give names and addresses of other protesters, which I did,"" said the 26-year old man.
""I refused to confess to attacking police and damaging property but signed a document promising not to demonstrate again, and not to talk to press. They said they'd kill me if I did."" He denied involvement in any attacks or vandalism.
The man said he was released, wrapped in a blanket and left outside his home in Baghdad after relatives pleaded for his freedom with contacts they knew in security forces and one paramilitary group. Reuters could not independently verify his account.
""Those detained and released are only released on bail. Charges are not dropped so they face re-arrest and trial,"" said Hassan Wahab from Baghdad-based human rights group Amal Association.
""Many people are fleeing, either heading to Erbil (the capital of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region) or abroad,"" Wahab said."

Concerns have focused on a Chinese law on domestic companies’ cooperation with the government on security matters, with critics saying that these could compel them to be a vehicle for Chinese spying.
Huawei denies the allegations made by Washington.
The U.S. official added that China presents a challenge to NATO and wants to undermine the rules-based international order.
""China is actively seeking a great presence and more influence across the globe, including in NATO's area of responsibility,"" the official told reporters.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have been inflamed by Trump's signing into law on Wednesday bills that back protesters in Hong Kong and threaten China with possible sanctions on human rights. The bill signing prompted China's Foreign Ministry on Thursday to warn of ""firm counter measures."""
1287,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 12:43PM ET</span>",Malta prime minister expected to quit in crisis over journalist murder,"By Chris Scicluna
VALLETTA (Reuters) - Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has told associates he plans to resign over the political and legal crisis stemming from the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, the Times of Malta reported on Friday.
Muscat's spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the report. His Labour Party canceled an event scheduled for Sunday at which Muscat was set to speak.
Muscat's chief of staff and two members of the cabinet have already stepped aside this week over the murder case, which threatens to bring down the island nation's close-knit elite.
Caruana Galizia, a campaigning journalist who investigated corruption, was blown up by a car bomb on Oct. 16, 2017. Her family demanded on Friday that Muscat resign, after his right hand man Keith Schembri was set free overnight.
Schembri, who quit as Muscat's chief of staff and was held for questioning in the case this week, denies wrongdoing. Police said they no longer needed him held for their investigation.
Caruana Galizia's family said Muscat should not preside over an investigation that implicates three of his closest colleagues.
""This travesty of justice is shaming our country, ripping our society apart, and it is degrading us. It cannot continue any longer,"" the family said in a statement.
Muscat has previously rebuffed calls to quit.
""I will not abdicate my responsibilities. Malta needs stable leadership and I will continue to take decisions in the interests of the country and will not protect anyone,"" he said.
His spokesman said Muscat would make an announcement ""in due course"".
""The PM has pledged various times he wants to see this case through,"" he said.
Roberta Metsola, a Maltese member of the European parliament, said in a tweet: ""If only #DaphneCaruanaGalizia was alive to see that even after they assassinated her, she brought the criminals down in disgrace.""
Three men have been awaiting trial for setting the bomb that killed Caruana Galizia but so far the authorities have failed to track down the person who hired them.
The case has moved quickly in recent weeks since a middleman suspected of introducing the killers to the person who ordered the hit was pardoned in return for testimony.
Earlier on Friday, Muscat's cabinet turned down a request to pardon a businessman, Yorgen Fenech, over the murder in return for testimony that Fenech's lawyers said would implicate senior government figures, including Schembri.
Fenech, who was arrested last week while trying to leave the island in his yacht, was also freed on bail on Friday.
He appeared in court later for a hearing at which he hopes to remove the lead investigator from the case for his alleged links to Schembri, the former chief of staff to the prime minister. He will be questioned by police again tomorrow. 
""I fear for my life, I'm ready to go all the way for justice to prevail and the truth to come out,"" Fenech told reporters outside the court.
COVER UP
The investigation focuses on Fenech, a businessman whose empire included property, retail, hospitality, gambling and energy companies. He handed the business reins to his brother a day before attempting to leave Malta. 
In a letter to the president, Fenech's lawyers said he was prepared to give information involving Schembri and two cabinet ministers - Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi and Economy Minister Chris Cardona. Mizzi resigned on Tuesday and Cardona has suspended himself from his duties. All three deny wrongdoing. 
Dunja Mijatovic, human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe, said she was ""seriously concerned by recent allegations of political interference in the investigation"" and called on Muscat to prevent the appearance of collusion.
Before she was killed, Caruana Galizia had revealed the existence of a secret offshore company called 17 Black. A Reuters investigation last year revealed Fenech was the owner of the company, named in emails as a vehicle to fund secret Panama companies owned by Schembri and Mizzi.
There is no evidence that money changed hands and Mizzi has said there are no links between him and Fenech's company. Cardona has also denied involvement.
One of Fenech's companies formed part of a consortium which was awarded a government contract in 2015 to build a power station. Other partners in that consortium included SOCAR of Azerbeijan and Siemens. Siemens and SOCAR have both denied their staff was involved in wrongdoing.

In a separate case on Friday showing how the corruption allegations have closed in on the government, a court ordered Mizzi, Cardona and Finance Minister Edward Scicluna to face a criminal probe over the granting of a contract to run hospitals. The three all deny wrongdoing in that case.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 12:27PM ET</span>",Iraq PM says he will quit after cleric's call but violence rages on,"By John Davison
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi announced his resignation on Friday after the country's senior Shi'ite Muslim cleric urged lawmakers to reconsider their support for a government rocked by weeks of deadly anti-establishment unrest.
Violence raged on in southern Iraq, however, killing at least 21 people, and protesters continued a thousands-strong sit-in at Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ) in central Baghdad.
Young, unemployed and unarmed protesters have led calls for a rehaul of a political system they say is endemically corrupt and serves foreign powers, especially Baghdad's ally Tehran.
The departure of Abdul Mahdi could be a blow for Iranian influence after Iran's militia allies and its own commanders intervened last month to keep the premier in place despite mass anti-government unrest.
The biggest unrest for years in a country struggling to recover from decades of conflict and sanctions pits protesters from Shi'ite heartlands in Baghdad and the south against a corrupt Shi'ite-dominated ruling elite seen as pawns of Iran.
Iraq's current political class is drawn mainly from powerful Shi'ite politicians, clerics and paramilitary leaders including many who lived in exile before a U.S.-led invasion overthrew Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003 - including Abdul Mahdi.
""In response to this (the cleric's) call, and in order to facilitate it as quickly as possible, I will present to parliament a demand (to accept) my resignation from the leadership of the current government,"" a statement signed by Abdul Mahdi said.
The statement did not say when he would resign. Parliament is to convene an emergency session on Sunday to discuss the crisis.
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani earlier urged parliament to considering withdrawing its support for Abdul Mahdi's government to stem spiraling violence.
Protesters celebrated the imminent departure of Abdul Mahdi, but said they would not stop their demonstrations until the whole of the political class was removed. Violence continued in southern Iraq.
""Abdul Mahdi's resignation is just the beginning. We'll stay in the streets until the entire government has gone, and all the rest of the corrupt politicians,"" said Mustafa Hafidh, a protester at Baghdad's Tahrir Square.
""It's not enough,"" said Ali al-Sayeda, another demonstrator. ""We need them all out, root and branch. We can't let up the pressure.""
VIOLENCE UNABATED
Security forces meanwhile shot dead at least 21 people in the southern city of Nassiriya after protesters tried to storm a local police headquarters, hospital sources said. In Najaf, unidentified armed men shot live rounds at demonstrators sending dozens scattering.
Iraqi forces have killed nearly 400 mostly young, unarmed demonstrators people since mass anti-government protests broke out on Oct. 1. More than a dozen members of the security forces have also died in clashes.
The burning of Iran's consulate in the holy city of Najaf on Wednesday escalated violence and drew a brutal response from security forces who shot dead more than 60 people nationwide on Thursday.
Sistani, who only weighs in on politics in times of crisis and wields huge influence over public opinion, on Friday warned against an explosion of civil strife and tyranny. He urged government forces to stop killing protests and protesters themselves to reject all violence.
The government ""appears to have been unable to deal with the events of the past two months...parliament, from which the current government emerged, must reconsider its choices and do what's in the interest of Iraq,"" a representative of Sistani said in a televised sermon.
Protesters ""must not allow peaceful demonstrations to be turned into attacks on property or people,"" he said.
Wednesday's attack on the Iranian consulate in Najaf set off an escalation in violence. 
On Thursday, security forces shot dead 46 people in Nassiriya, 18 in Najaf and four in Baghdad.
Friday's deaths in Nassiriya bring the death toll since Oct. 1 to at least 435, mostly unarmed protesters, according to a Reuters tally from medical and police sources.

Iraq's ""enemies and their apparatuses are trying to sow chaos and infighting to return the country to the age of dictatorship ... everyone must work together to thwart that opportunity,"" Sistani said, without elaborating.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 11:19AM ET</span>","Paris and Berlin at odds, but talk of rupture overblown","By Luke Baker and Andreas Rinke
LONDON/BERLIN (Reuters) - France and Germany have been at loggerheads in recent weeks, with differences over NATO and the future of Europe prompting some commentators to conclude that the two nations underpinning European unity are fundamentally split.
But away from the headlines, steady work continues that suggests they are not as far apart as sometimes appears, at least on foreign and security policy, even if the chances of a bold new Franco-German understanding remain remote.
While there are vast contrasts in style and at times substance between Emmanuel Macron, 41, a hard-charging first-time president, and Angela Merkel, 65, a consensus-building fourth-time chancellor, both are acutely aware that the need to reach a Paris-Berlin consensus tends to trump all else.
""The situation is not as tense or ruptured as some have stated,"" said Francois Heisbourg, a senior advisor on Europe at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and a former senior official in the French foreign and defense ministries.
""The French do understand that the German government is currently in a state of paralysis, which means the ability of Germany to take substantive new initiatives or to respond to French initiatives is very limited.""
In June 2018, Merkel and Macron met outside Berlin and agreed the Meseberg declaration, a series of commitments on issues from security and defense policy to migration, economic policy, climate and a eurozone budget.
On foreign policy and defense, Paris and Berlin are pushing ahead on a European Intervention Initiative, will host talks next month between Kiev and Moscow in an effort to end the conflict in Ukraine, and are exploring ways of making EU foreign-policy decision-making more effective, including a possible U.N.-style European Security Council. They also agree on joint fighter planes and tank development.
Macron and Merkel will meet next week at a gathering of NATO's 29 heads of government outside London.
While the agenda may be dominated by the French president's criticism of the alliance as ""brain dead"", it equally will be an opportunity for the two leaders to clear the air and talk up how closer coordination among Britain, France and Germany can bolster both European security and NATO.
""Whether Britain is in the EU or not, there is a clear recognition in Paris and Berlin that Britain has a key role to play in European security, under the umbrella of NATO and otherwise. There is a lot of focus on making that happen,"" said a British official involved in the discussions.
CAUTIOUS MERKEL
Since coming to power in May 2017, Macron has chaffed at German foot-dragging. Merkel, who must always weigh the demands of her ruling coalition, has been unable to match the French president's zeal for sweeping reform on issues ranging from a eurozone budget to changes to EU enlargement policy.
Merkel's term is up in 2021, but she shows little inclination to pursue grand legacy policies. Her putative successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is similarly restrained by Germany's consensus politics.
Hence the impatience on the part of Macron, who wants to move fast while also conscious that even if he is reelected in 2022, time is limited to achieve his vision, which will still require German buy-in.
""German-French cooperation is like two sides of an accordion, sometimes you pull it apart a bit, then both sides are coming back together again,"" said a German diplomat.
""They know that they are fixed to each other. And they know that they can only produce a nice sound together.""
Germany holds the rotating presidency of the EU in the second half of 2020 and is already coordinating with Paris on ensuring consistency between that period and France's presidency in the first half of 2022."
1290,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 11:19AM ET</span>",China mixing military and science in Arctic push: Denmark,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - China's military is increasingly using scientific research in the Arctic as a way into the region, a Danish intelligence service said on Friday, as it warned of intensifying geopolitical rivalry in the Earth's freezing North.
Disputes in the Arctic over global warming and access to minerals broke into the open in May when U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo accused Russia of aggressive behaviour in the polar region and said China's actions must be watched closely.
""A great power play is shaping up between Russia, the United States and China, which is increasing the level of tension in the (Arctic) region,"" the Defence Intelligence Service said in its annual risk assessment report.
China, which defines itself as a 'near-Arctic state', has an ambition to gain greater access to untapped resources and faster trade through the Northern Sea Route.
In 2017, Beijing included Arctic sea routes in its so-called Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to strengthen China's ties to the rest of the world through infrastructure projects and research.
China has in recent years invested heavily in Arctic research. But Danish Defence Intelligence Service chief Lars Findsen said on Friday that Chinese research expeditions in the Arctic are not just a matter of science but serve a ""dual purpose.""
""We have looked at Chinese research activities in the Arctic, and see that the Chinese military is showing an increasing interest in being part of that,"" he said.
Findsen declined to name specific research expeditions involving the Chinese military, but said examples in recent years signalled a ""new development"".
""It is likely that a part of China's build-up of knowledge about the Arctic and capacity to operate in the Arctic will take place in a collaboration between civilian and military actors,"" the report said.
Denmark has made it a priority to maintain the Arctic as an area of international cooperation and resolve any potential issues through political negotiations between countries with Arctic territory. Greenland, a vast island straddling the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, is a self-ruling part of Denmark.
But Denmark's goal has become harder to achieve as Russia in particular is strengthening its military capabilities there, the intelligence report said.
""This is an essential driving force for several other Arctic coastal states starting to strengthen their (own) regional military capabilities,"" it said.
The report also said a new U.S. Arctic strategy published in June this year combined with public comments from high level government and defence officials, have also contributed to heightened tension in the region.
Increased U.S. interest in the Arctic became apparent in August when President Donald Trump suggested buying Greenland from Denmark, an idea quickly dismissed by the Danish and regional Greenland governments."

Israel's military said soldiers had been fending off Palestinians who had approached and tried to sabotage its security fence. The military also said the demonstrators threw a number of explosive devices.
Residents in Gaza said a few dozen Palestinians had approached the border fence, an area in which Israel's military, citing security concerns, enforces a ""no go"" zone. Some in the crowd hurled stones at the barrier, residents said.
One 16-year-old was killed and four other people were wounded by live fire, Gaza's health ministry said.
An Israeli army spokesman said soldiers had ""identified a number of attempts to approach the fence as well as a number of attempts to sabotage it"".
""Troops responded with riot dispersal means and 0.22 caliber rounds,"" the spokesman said. ""A report regarding the death of a Palestinian is being looked into.""
Israeli soldiers have been confronted by frequent Palestinian protests that often turn violent along the Gaza border. They have used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition against demonstrators who the military said hurled rocks or petrol bombs at them.
The organisers of those protests said they had called off this week's mass-demonstration, but a smaller crowd still gathered.
Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations have been working to keep the border calm.
Gaza officials say about 210 Palestinians have been killed since the weekly protests began in March 2018. In that time an Israeli soldier was shot dead by a Palestinian sniper along the frontier and another was killed during an undercover raid into Gaza."

The marches, held in cities and towns across the country, marked the 41st consecutive weekly protest of a movement that has already forced the ruling hierarchy to jettison a veteran president and jail top officials.
The protest movement's continued momentum now poses a major challenge to the military, which has pushed for the December 12 election as the only way to resolve the deadlock between the authorities and the nebulous, leaderless opposition movement.
Protesters on Friday chanted ""No to the election"", ""Free the detainees"" and ""the army should leave politics"" as they marched through central Algiers. One protester held up a placard reading: ""They have the vote. We have the veto"".
Since the election campaign officially began earlier this month, tensions have escalated, with more frequent demonstrations, more arrests, longer prison terms and scuffles between police and protesters in a provincial town on Wednesday.
Algeria's main labor union, which is pro-government, plans a rare march on Saturday in Algiers to demonstrate in favor of the election.
The protests began in February as it became clear that veteran leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika planned to seek another presidential term in a vote originally scheduled for July.
As hundreds of thousands marched across the country, the army pushed him to quit in April. Dozens of senior figures, including a former intelligence chief, Bouteflika's brother, government ministers and allied business tycoons were detained.
Several of them have been jailed for long terms on corruption charges and two former prime ministers, Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal, are to be prosecuted next week.
However, the protesters have demanded a more thorough purge of the ruling elite, which has controlled Algeria since winning independence from France in 1962, and the authorities have also arrested dozens of opposition figures and demonstrators.
Algeria, which relies heavily on oil and gas sales, has been hit hard by the crash in oil prices, halving its revenues from $60 billion to $30 billion."

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - International organizations warned on Friday of a potential resurgence of Ebola in Congo after deadly militia attacks on health centers forced aid groups to suspend operations and withdraw staff from the epidemic's last strongholds.
Maid Maid militia fighters killed four people and injured several others at two Ebola centers on Thursday in the worst yet of violence hampering efforts to tame the outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The world's second biggest Ebola epidemic on record has killed over 2,200 people since mid-2018, but new infections slowed in recent months.
""Ebola was retreating and now it is likely to resurge,"" World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a news briefing in Geneva. WHO has relocated 173 staff while the U.N. children's agency UNICEF has evacuated 20 staff.
After Thursday's fatal raids on health centers in Mangina and Byakoto, a screening center was also attacked overnight in the town of Oicha, Congolese health authorities said.
Maid Maid fighters and local residents have attacked health facilities sometimes because they believe Ebola does not exist and in other cases because of resentment that they have not benefited from the influx of donor funding.
The International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) halted operations in the towns of Mangina, Beni and Butembo.
""We've had to put all Ebola activities on hold in high-risk areas,"" said Corrie Butler, spokeswoman for the IFRC in Congo, saying the attacks had been in areas with most Ebola cases.
At least 1,500 Red Cross staff and volunteers are involved in Ebola work in east Congo, she said, most in areas where activities are now suspended due to violence.
The World Food Programme (WFP), another U.N. agency which provides food to those around infected people and at risk of Ebola, said its activities had also been interrupted due to insecurity.
Congolese health authorities said they had evacuated 13 staff and other transfers were underway.
The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) charity said activities at its treatment centers in Mambasa and Katwa towns were not suspended but it was monitoring the security situation closely.
Thursday's attacks followed raids on communities by suspected Islamist rebels believed to have killed at least 100 people in the past month, according to U.N. figures.
At least four people also died this week during protests at the perceived failure of the army and U.N. peacekeepers to protect civilians from the Islamist Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 09:43AM ET</span>","Sudan's ex-ruling party condemns law dissolving it, to continue 'reforms'","KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's former ruling National Congress Party of deposed president Omar al-Bashir condemned a law passed by transitional authorities to dissolve the NCP and seize its assets, saying it would pursue internal reforms.
The legal committee of the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) coalition, which spearheaded months of unrest that led to Bashir's ouster in April and now shares power with the military, said on Friday that the NCP has been dissolved in accordance with the law. There was no immediate official comment.
The law will be a test of the transitional authorities' ability to banish to the past three decades of rule by Bashir, who seized power in a June 1989 coup and implanted his repressive Islamist movement deep into Sudanese institutions.
The FFC now shares power with the military ahead of planned free elections in three years' time.
An NCP statement issued on Friday said the dissolution order, if carried out, ""would add nothing to the country but tension and hyperbole devastating to political life.
""We assure our proud people and our extended membership in cities, villages, towns and districts across Sudan that we are continuing to complete the reform and change we have initiated before others in order to safeguard our country and serve our people,"" the NCP said.
""With its reckless decisions (the FFC) wants to return (Sudan) to the malicious, vicious cycle that has held back the country for the past 63 years,"" the statement added, referring to Sudan's six decades as an independent state.
The NCP said its right to participate in political life was guaranteed by national and international statutes.
On Thursday evening, the co-ruling Sovereign Council and government Cabinet approved the dissolution of the NCP and repealed a public order law that had been used to regulate the behavior of women under the Islamist Bashir.
The two measures responded to key demands by the protest movement.
The law's text was posted on Twitter by the Sudanese Congress Party, a member of the FFC. The text stipulates: ""The National Congress Party shall be dissolved and its legal personality shall expire and shall be removed from the registry of political parties and organizations in Sudan.""
Properties and funds owned by the NCP or associated groups shall be seized and transferred to the finance ministry, it said.
The Sovereign Council and the technocratic Cabinet plan to form a ""Committee for the dismantling of the June 30 regime"" with broad investigative powers and authority to break up unions, parties and other organizations from the Bashir era."

AGUILA BEACH, Spain (Reuters) - Sunbathers in the Canary Islands joined forces with emergency workers to give water, food and clothes to migrants who arrived unexpectedly on a beach in the Spanish archipelago on Friday. 
Some two dozen migrants, among them three infants and one pregnant woman, landed in a rickety boat on the rocky shores of the Aguila beach, Gran Canaria. 
Exhausted, cold and some seemingly in a state of shock after weathering the Atlantic, they were given thermal blankets, food and water by rescue workers. 
Red Cross officials said the migrants, who were from northern and sub-Saharan Africa, told them of six days spent navigating at times rough waters. 
""It was a really tough journey,"" Jose Antonio Rodriguez of the Red Cross said. One of the babies on the boat was taken to hospital with a fever. 
Sunseekers, who ranged from tourists visiting the island to locals, sprang into action after the boat arrived, he said. 
""They were the first ones to help out, giving them food, water and milk for the babies after they saw how hungry they were,"" he said. ""They also gave clothing as the migrants were soaking wet."" 
One woman cradled a weary migrant in her lap as another swimsuit-clad woman gave her water. Another used his beach towel to keep her feet warm. 
Some 27,594 migrants had arrived in Spain this year by mid-November, according to data from the Interior Ministry, a decrease of more than 50% from the same period last year. 

The popular tourist destination of the Canary Islands, however, has seen an increase of 22% in arrivals, with 1,493 migrants arriving so far this year by mid-November.

""I will miss warm hugs and the occasional kisses from my boss,"" King said of Commission President Juncker, known for kissing on the cheek colleagues and world leaders alike, including U.S. President Donald Trump.
With Britain set to leave the bloc on Jan. 31, London has declined to name a representative to the new European Commission, which takes office on Sunday under German conservative Ursula von der Leyen, helping to shape policies and trade deals for more than 500 million Europeans.

LA ROCHELLE, France (Reuters) - Tugboat captain Jean-Yves Lagarde should be only 10 years from retiring thanks to special benefits for mariners that date back to the 17th century. But President Emmanuel Macron's ambition to simplify France's Byzantine pension system may scuttle his plan.
The weather-beaten 45-year-old spent a decade traversing the world's oceans on cargo ships, encountering pirates in Asia and working in stifling temperatures below deck before returning to the port town of La Rochelle to do battle with Atlantic storms.
A career toiling in punishing conditions merits the early retirement accorded to mariners, Lagarde said. Angry he could lose the perk, Lagarde will join a nationwide strike on Dec. 5 called by public sector unions to force Macron to back down.
""After all, we have a pension plan that has stood the test of time for four centuries,"" Lagarde said, steering his tug towards a choppy sea.
The showdown against unions will set the tone for the second half of Macron's mandate, with more reforms including an overhaul of unemployment benefits lined up, and comes as discontent swirls in hospitals, the police force and in schools.
Sailors are covered by France's earliest pension regime, drawn up in 1673 during the rule of Louis XIV to look after seamen disabled at sea.
They are entitled to retire on a full pension aged 52.5 - nearly a decade earlier than the typical worker - if they have worked for 37.5 years.
It is one of a dozen 'special regimes' with different retirement ages and benefits that cover among others rail workers, dancers at the Paris Opera and comedians. In all, the pension system comprises more than 40 different plans. 
Macron says the system is unfair. He wants a single, points-based system under which for each euro contributed, every pensioner has equal rights.
NATIONWIDE STRIKE
It will not be easy. Nearly one in every two people oppose Macron's pension reform, an Elabe survey showed this month.
As the government finalizes the draft bill, transport unions are plotting to bring major disruption to France's rail network, ports and airports on Dec. 5th and perhaps beyond. Teachers, emergency room doctors and truck drivers are joining in.
After last-ditch talks this week, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe promised unions there would be no brutal transition from the old to new regime. But the government would hold its course, he said.
The last time a French president squared off against unions over special pension regimes it ended badly. In 1995, strikes paralyzed Paris and prime minister Alain Juppe pulled the reforms in a stinging defeat from which he failed to recover.
After Greece and Italy, France is the third biggest spender on pensions among developed nations, spending 14% of national output on pensions, OECD data shows. In comparison, Germany spends 10%, the United States 7% and Britain 6%.
Mariners are particularly burdensome: the state largely covers company contributions, in some cases fully, financing 78% of total contributions in a sector with 39,000 active workers and nearly three times as many retirees.
Furthermore, a sailor who spends part of his career on the sea before taking a land-based maritime job can still earn full benefits - a cherished idiosyncrasy at odds with Macron's ambition.
""No-one argues that a mariner's job is tough. The question is how do we gauge how tough?,"" said an adviser to Macron's pension reform tsar Jean-Paul Delevoye.
As the wind whipped across the Bay of Biscay, Lagarde argued his benefits were costly but deserved.

""At forty-five,"" he said, ""I'm at the age where I am starting to feel a weariness that's down to my work.""

The talks are meant to be a step forward in what the U.N. says will be a long road to political rapprochement, followed by elections.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 08:04AM ET</span>","After Trump's Afghan visit, Taliban say they are ready to resume peace talks","KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban said on Friday they were ready to restart peace talks with the United States, a day after President Donald Trump visited U.S. troops in Afghanistan and said he believed the radical group would agree to a ceasefire.
Trump's surprise Thanksgiving Day visit was his first to Afghanistan since becoming president and came a week after a prisoner swap between Washington and Kabul that raised hopes for a long elusive peace deal to end the 18-year war.
""The Taliban wants to make a deal and we are meeting with them,"" Trump told reporters after arriving in Afghanistan on Thursday.
""We say it has to be a ceasefire and they didn't want to do a ceasefire and now they want to do a ceasefire, I believe. It will probably work out that way,"" he said.
Trump canceled peace negotiations in September after the militant group claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul that killed 12 people, including an American soldier. 
Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline Islamist insurgent group, said on Friday they were ""ready to restart the talks"".
""Our stance is still the same. If peace talks start, it will be resumed from the stage where it had stopped,"" Mujahid told Reuters.
Taliban leaders have told Reuters that the group has been holding meetings with senior U.S. officials in Doha since last weekend, adding they could soon resume formal peace talks.
""We are hoping that Trump's visit to Afghanistan will prove that he is serious to start talks again. We don't think he has not much of a choice,"" said a senior Taliban commander on conditions of anonymity. 
Trump did not answer reporters' questions when he returned on Friday morning to Florida, where he is spending the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend away from Washington. 
There are currently about 13,000 U.S. forces as well as thousands of other NATO troops in Afghanistan, 18 years after a U.S.-led coalition invaded the country following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States.
About 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed in the course of the Afghan conflict.
A draft accord agreed in September would have thousands of American troops withdrawn in exchange for guarantees that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States or its allies.

Still, many U.S. officials doubt the Taliban could be relied upon to prevent al Qaeda from again plotting attacks against the United States from Afghan soil.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police on Friday withdrew from a university campus trashed by weeks of clashes as pro-democracy activists canvassed social media to promote more protests at the weekend.
Senior members of Hong Kong Polytechnic University toured buildings strewn with debris after police left, including a sports hall and a ruined Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) outlet, seeing smashed windows and charred piles of former barricades.
After more than five months of increasingly violent demonstrations, the Chinese-ruled city has enjoyed relative calm since local elections on Sunday delivered an overwhelming victory to pro-democracy candidates.
Activists are trying to keep up momentum, after winning backing from U.S. President Donald Trump that has renewed global attention on the Asian financial hub and infuriated Beijing.
""Many classrooms, laboratories and library were destroyed. Even so, there's been no loss of life. We insisted on adopting a humane way to solve the crisis,"" university president Teng Jin-Guang told reporters, saying the next semester would go ahead on time.
Located on Kowloon peninsula, the campus became a battleground earlier this month when protesters barricaded themselves in and fought riot police in a hail of petrol bombs, water cannon and tear gas. 
Police arrested more than 1,300 people during the turmoil at the university, Kwok Ka-chuen, a senior police official, told reporters on Friday. A total of 5,890 people have been arrested since early June, he added.
Before police left, they seized nearly 4,000 Molotov cocktails and hundreds of bottles of chemicals, Kwok said.
At one point on Friday, a man and woman emerged from the campus wearing black face masks and walked out hand-in-hand, with no sign of police. 
""WE ARE ALL SIMON""
Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering, says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time, and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
Beijing warned Washington of ""firm counter measures"" after Trump signed legislation supporting the protesters on Wednesday. 
On a visit to Bangkok, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Friday tried to reassure the Thai government and businesses that her city was still an attractive financial hub.
The anti-government protests have at times forced businesses, government, schools and even the international airport to close. The unrest has hit the economy, with data on Friday showing tourist arrivals fell 44% in October from a year earlier.
A few hundred protesters, some carrying Union Jack flags, gathered at the British consulate on Friday urging London to extend citizenship to Hong Kong residents born before the 1997 handover to China and classified as overseas British nationals. 
They chanted ""We are all Simon"", referring to a former consulate employee, Simon Cheng, who said Chinese secret police beat him and deprived him of sleep seeking information about activists behind the protests.
Hong Kong's justice secretary has urged him to report the matter to the relevant Chinese authorities and said she has no opinion on the accusations. 
Other demonstrations planned over the weekend include a rally by secondary school students, a protest against the use of tear gas near children, and a ""march of gratitude"" to the U.S. consulate.

A rally planned for Dec. 8 by Civil Human Rights Front, the group that organized million-strong marches in June, is likely to provide the best gauge of the democracy movement's support.

DURRES, Albania (Reuters) - Rescue workers sifted through the rubble of a hotel by the Adriatic Sea for possible survivors on Friday, three days after a 6.4-magnitude destroyed the six-storey building and many others in the Albanian port of Durres and surrounding areas.
The death toll from the quake, Albania's worst ever, has reached 49. There have been more than 500 aftershocks since Tuesday's quake, some with a magnitude of more than 5.0, rocking already damaged buildings and terrifying residents.
The sea-front hotel, the Mira Mare, is now the only site where rescue work is still continuing. The search teams, from neighboring Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia, said a female dancer was believed to be buried beneath the rubble.
Nearby, another hotel, the Ljubljana, was leaning to one side, its ornamental Roman columns cracked. Shattered glass and a toppled potted plant lay strewn across what had been its reception area.
A woman pushed a pushchair piled high with bags of what appeared to be possessions she had managed to rescue from the wreckage of her home.
""At the moment when the earthquake struck, I wasn't scared at all. But when I went out, and saw the horror, I became petrified,"" said Durres resident Tahir Halili.
""Even now, as we speak, I am not at all well. When I saw all that destruction, that hell, all those lost lives, my friend, it is unbelievable.""
Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said 25 people had died in Durres, 23 in the northern town of Thumane and one in the town of Lac. The quake damaged more than 700 houses in Durres, destroyed 12 more and left nearly 200 apartment buildings with cracks and fissures, he said.
Rama extended a 30-day state of emergency already in force in Durres and Thumane to Lac. A family of six was due to be buried in Thumane on Friday.
More than 5,000 people have been left homeless by the quake, Rama said. They are being housed in hotels, schools, gyms and other temporary accommodation.
""Do not stay at home if it is damaged,"" Defence Minister Olta Xhacka appealed to citizens during a news conference.
""We are able to offer shelter, food and clothing. The quality of life and health of citizens is our concern and life in tents is temporary."""

Atambayev, who refused to attend preliminary hearings, was escorted to the courtroom on Friday, his lawyer Sergei Slesarev told reporters. News media have been banned from the trial.
Atambayev, who ruled the Central Asian nation of six million people between 2011-2017, supported his then-ally and prime minister Sooronbai Jeenbekov in the 2017 election, but the two fell out just months into Jeenbekov's presidency.
The charges against Atambayev stem from the 2013 release from a Kyrgyz prison on stated compassionate grounds of Aziz Batukayev, a man described by Kyrgyz officials as a mob kingpin who had been convicted of illegal possession of drugs and firearms and of organizing riots.
At the time, the authorities cited Batukayev's terminal illness as the reason for the release - which investigators now say was untrue. There have been no reports that Batukayev has died and he is believed to be living in Russia.
Atambayev earlier denied all charges against him, calling them politically motivated. On Friday, according to his lawyer, Atambayev remained silent throughout the hearing, ignoring all questions from the judge."

A day earlier, Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) said the helicopters collided after one of them retreated under fire from its fighters, but it did not provide any evidence for its claim. 
""There has been no gunfire from jihadists on our helicopters,"" French army chief of staff François Lecointre told French radio station RFI. The army has said the helicopters had crashed after colliding accidentally during a combat operation. 
Lecointre also said France had no intention of withdrawing from Mali but that it needs more support from its allies.
France, the former colonial power in the region, intervened in Mali in 2013 to drive out militants who had occupied the north. It still has a 4,500-strong Barkhane force countering insurgencies in the wider region.
On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron - in a joint news conference with NATO General-Secretary Jens Stoltenberg - said that France was acting on everyone's behalf in the Sahel and also pressed French allies to do more.
Macron has asked his government to look hard at France's operations in the region and has said ""all options are open"". 

However, French officials have ruled out France withdrawing its 4,500-strong force from the region for fear that this could lead to even more chaos.

The ruling paves the way for Zuma's long-awaited trial to start in February 2020.
Zuma, in office from 2009-2018, had previously applied for a permanent stay of prosecution on 18 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to an arms deal with French defense firm Thales in the 1990s.
In mid-October, the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed an application by Zuma and Thales for a permanent stay of prosecution. Zuma appealed against it, but on Friday the court struck out his appeal.
Zuma is accused of accepting 500,000 rand ($34,000) annually from Thales in 1999, in exchange for protecting the company from an investigation into the deal. He rejects the allegations as a politically motivated ""witch-hunt"" against him.
Thales, known as Thompson-CSF in 1999, has said it had no knowledge of any transgressions by any of its employees in relation to the awarding of the contracts.
The National Prosecuting Authority initially filed the charges against Zuma a decade ago, but set them aside shortly before Zuma successfully ran for president in 2009. Following appeals and lobbying by opposition parties, the NPA reinstated the charges in March 2018."

A 16th Century translation of the first book of Tacitus’s Annals - written in elegant italic hand on ruled paper - has been shown to be Elizabeth's after an analysis of handwriting, her style of writing and the type of paper used.
""The manuscript translation of Tacitus Annales now preserved at Lambeth Palace Library is the work of Elizabeth I,"" John-Mark Philo wrote in The Review of English Studies.
""Elizabeth goes to some lengths to retain the density of Tacitus’s prose and his celebrated brevity,"" Philo wrote. ""She follows the contours of the Latin syntax with remarkable commitment, even at the risk of obscuring the sense in English.""
Tacitus, a historian of the Roman Empire, casts Tiberius and Nero as tyrants and relates the debauchery and corruption of the empire's rulers.
Elizabeth endured a tumultuous childhood including the disgrace and death of her mother, and persecution under her half sister Mary I, before ascending to the throne aged 25.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court sentenced a K-pop musician to six years in prison on Friday for raping a woman and distributing a video capturing the act in a case that drew attention to the darker side of the country's lucrative entertainment industry.
Jung Joon-young, 30, was arrested in March. Choi Jong-hoon, 30, a former member of South Korean boy band FT Island, was also sentenced to five years in prison for the rape of the woman.
Both were members of online chat groups that shared secret sex tapes and made jokes about drugging and raping women, the Seoul Central District Court said.
Jung's conviction also includes the illegal distribution of other videos he took secretly while having sex with women. The identities of the victims were suppressed to protect their privacy.
The court also sentenced each man to 80 hours in ""sexual violence treatment"" education.
""The defendants are well-known celebrities and friends, but the chat they've had showed that they simply considered women as objects of sexual pleasure, and committed crimes that were extremely serious,"" Judge Kang Seong-soo said as he handed down the verdict. 
""Strict punishment is inevitable as the damage inflicted has not properly been recovered and the victims demand harsh penalties.""
Jung admitted distributing the video and others he took, though he argued the sex was in all cases consensual. Choi denied raping the woman, and had argued that he did not remember having sex with her and that if he had, it was likely consensual.
Lawyers for Jung and Choi could not be reached for comment.
Their case was one of several scandals involving sex crimes and other illegal activity that revealed a dark side of an industry at the center of the global K-pop craze.

Lee Seung-hyun, a former member of K-pop group Big Bang better known by the stage name Seungri, is also on trial over accusations he paid for prostitutes for foreign businessmen to drum up investment in his business.

GRAAFF-REINET, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africa's Karoo region has always been parched - it means land of thirst in the language of its earliest inhabitants, the Khoisan hunter gatherers.
Yet nothing prepared residents of its oldest town, Graaff-Reinet, for their worst drought in more than a century.
As the dry spell entered its fourth year, tap water turned brown and smelled like rotting fish. When the water behind the Nqweba Dam dried up, depositing tens of thousands of dead fish onto cracked earth, queues began forming at municipal bore holes and farm animals died in their hundreds.
The bleak choices facing millions of people in drought-stricken southern Africa - whether to flush toilets or not, or to keep animals alive or let them die - could soon be faced by other places on a warming planet with shrinking water supplies.
""This area is dry but our taps have never been completely empty. Never,"" said Bukelwa Booysen, who has had to send staff in search of borehole water for her school for disabled children, and send the kids home when they can't find any.
An abnormally hot summer with rainfall 75% below average, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has struck the whole region. The United Nations says 45 million people in southern Africa face hunger.
'WHEN IT RUNS OUT'
Bushes and trees clinging to the Karoo's rocky ravines are withered and grey - even hardy acacia thorns are dying. Signs mark rivers that are now dry beds.
At one farm, Gerrie Snyman, 65, was feeding grain to sheep and goats that couldn't find pasture.
More than a third of his couple-thousand goats and sheep had either died or been sold this year. His 80 cows were now 15. He loaded a calf that was starving - its mother had stopped producing milk - onto his truck to take home and shoot.
A friend had shot himself dead after his animals died of thirst.
""We are grateful to the Almighty for our borehole water,"" he said. ""We don't know what we'll do when it runs out.""
When Cape Town's reservoir nearly ran dry 18 months ago, it made international headlines and authorities rationed water. Yet Karoo is long past water rationing.
For Valentia Esho, 45, an unemployed mother of seven in the township of Umazisakhe, it means letting her toilet fill up instead of flushing, never washing clothes and only washing plates that stink. Water is just for drinking.
""The house is really smelling,"" she said, inside her one-room brick-and-tin home. ""Everyone is paining from stomach aches and diarrhoea.""
In another township, Asherville, where wind kicked up dust devils, school headmaster Basil Vaaltyn was overseeing water distribution from a truck. He'd done everything to cut down on his usage: ""I'm down to a minute showering instead of two."" His wife saves dirty dishwater to fill the cistern.
A spokesman for the municipality said it was drilling boreholes, installing pipelines and building an 18-million-litre reservoir, adding: ""Usage of water is still very high. The community is requested to use water sparingly.""
'THERE'S WATER HERE'
With municipal authorities overwhelmed, South African charity Gift of the Givers is trucking water to townships and drilling boreholes.
Gideon Groenewald, a geohydrologist for the charity, uses science and spirituality to look for groundwater. When he was growing up on a farm, he used to dowse with wet twigs. Nowadays he prefers magnetic detectors.
""I open Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) maps and look for the lines of trees. I ask God in prayer which lines hold water, then I go down to that GPS location,"" he said while a forked stick turned in his hand over an arid patch of shrubs.
""You see the stick moving where the magnetic field is? There's water here,"" he continued. ""It's pure science.""
The charity has drilled 1,800 boreholes in the past three years, Groenewald said, only a third of them dry.
But Louise Stafford, water director for the Nature Conservancy in South Africa, urged caution with boreholes, because groundwater is a finite resource.
Water-intensive agriculture like citrus farms can make droughts worse, she said, and leaky pipes are losing a billion litres a year - problems Water Minister Lindiwe Sisulu pledged to tackle in a new water masterplan she delivered on Thursday.
One Sunday, as clouds formed over Graaff-Reinet, its Assembly Church prayed. The clouds spat but didn't pour.
""We pray for God to open heaven and send rain,"" Pastor Dolan Cochrane said.
The congregation bowed.
""Lord,"" Cochrane continued. ""We know that, in your time, you will come to our rescue."""

Han told reporters late on Thursday there were ""many really strange polls"" and even ""fake polls"" and people should refuse to answer calls from pollsters.
However, writing on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Friday, Han said people should simply tell pollsters they were supporting Tsai.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Yasuhiro Nakasone, one of Japan's longest reigning premiers and known for his friendship with Ronald Reagan, has died at the age of 101, a top ruling party official said on Friday. 
Nakasone, prime minister from 1982 to 1987, hobnobbed on the world stage with Reagan and Margaret Thatcher while battling with bureaucrats over domestic reforms.
He himself said he failed to achieve a dream of revising the country's pacifist, post-war constitution to clarify the ambiguous status of the military.
""Revising the constitution takes time. I stressed to the public that it was necessary, but it was not possible to begin the revision quickly,"" the straight-talking Nakasone told Reuters in an interview in January 2010.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made loosening the limits of the U.S.-drafted constitution a key goal but revising the charter's pacifist Article Nine remains contentious.
Known for his ""Ron and Yasu"" friendship with Reagan, Nakasone made headlines after taking office when he said that in event of a war, he would make Japan an unsinkable ""aircraft carrier"" for U.S. forces and bottle up the Soviet navy.
Nakasone also broke an unwritten rule on limiting the annual defense budget to 1% of gross national product.
In 1983, he became the first Japanese premier to officially visit South Korea, mending fences with a country that Japan had brutally colonized from 1910 to 1945.
Nakasone, a former lieutenant in the Imperial Navy who lost his younger brother in World War Two, outraged Asian countries when he made an official visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where convicted war criminals are honored along with Japan's war dead, on the 40th anniversary of Japan's surrender.
He decided not to repeat the pilgrimage after it sparked riots in China.
Nakasone, like Abe, was a security hawk but did not adopt a revisionist view of Japan's wartime legacy. 
""The big difference is that Nakasone lived through"" the war, said Andrew Horvat, a visiting professor at Josai International University. ""He didn't try to minimize the impact of the war ... and was not insensitive to the feelings of neighboring countries.""
In a 1978 memoir, Nakasone recalled setting up a ""comfort station"" - a euphemism for a military brothel - on the island of Borneo during the war, although he later denied personal knowledge of the facility.
Abe, for his part, has stuck by a 1994 government apology to ""comfort women"", but has denied there is direct evidence of widespread coercion by the military. 
The issue remains a major source of friction in Tokyo's relations with Seoul, since many of the women were Korean.
Nakasone's outspoken ways sometimes caused problems.
In 1986 he offended blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans living in the United States by saying they brought the average intelligence level of Americans below that of Japan.
Nakasone pursued domestic reforms aggressively, privatizing Japan's state-run railway, tobacco and telecommunications monopolies. Critics say, however, that he failed to implement a landmark set of reform proposals to help Japan's economy grow.
Nakasone won a rare fifth year in office after leading his Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory in 1986 elections. But his career was shadowed by links to a huge political scandal, a stocks-for-favors scam.
He quit the LDP in 1989 over the scandal but two years later was welcomed back as a senior adviser. He retired in 2003.
Born in the hilly district of Takasaki, northwest of Tokyo, on May 27, 1918, to a wealthy timber trader, Nakasone graduated from the Tokyo Imperial University, later the Tokyo University, before entering the Home Ministry in 1941.

He joined the Tokyo Police Department after Japan's surrender in 1945. Nakasone has two daughters and a politician son, Hirofumi.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed ""great satisfaction"" over the latest test of a large multiple-rocket launcher, state media said on Friday, a launch that experts said showcased improving performance by the system and its crews.
North Korea fired two short-range projectiles into the sea off its east coast on Thursday in a fourth test of its new ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"", South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said told a briefing.
The latest test of the so-called KN-25 missile came as a Thanksgiving Day reminder to the United States of a year-end deadline Kim has set for Washington to show flexibility in their stalled denuclearization talks.
The series of tests since the KN-25 was first unveiled in August show the North Koreans steadily improving their ability to quickly fire multiple rockets from their mobile launch vehicles.
That capability makes it more likely that in case of a war, North Korean rocket crews could speedily deploy, fire and move before being targeted by South Korean or American forces, experts said.
""The faster it fires, the quicker it can (get) out of dodge before counter-fire arrives,"" Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), said on Twitter.
""READY FOR DEPLOYMENT""
In the first two KN-25 tests in August and September missiles were fired 17 minutes and 19 minutes apart, respectively, the JCS said.
By the end of October crews had narrowed that interval to three minutes, while on Thursday the gap between the two missiles was only about 30 seconds.
""The volley test-fire aimed to finally examine the combat application of the super-large multiple-launch rocket system proved the military and technical superiority of the weapon system and its firm reliability,"" KCNA said.
Photos released by KCNA showed missiles being fired from a transporter-erector-launcher equipped with four launcher tubes.
The new short-range missiles pose a direct threat to South Korea and U.S. forces stationed there, experts said.
The missiles traveled up to 380 km (236 miles) and reached an altitude of 97 km, according to the JCS, putting nearly all of South Korea within range.
""North Korea is trying to selectively modernize conventional forces in a low-cost, high-efficiency way to focus on the economy and reassure the military while nuclear talks are under way, and the rocket launcher is a product of that effort,"" said Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean Navy officer who teaches at Kyungnam University in Seoul.
""The latest test indicated that the system was ready for mass production and deployment.""
COUNTDOWN TO A DEADLINE
A spokesman at Seoul's Unification Ministry in charge of inter-Korean affairs on Friday urged the North to cease acts that may heighten military tension and return to dialogue.
Kim has set an end-year deadline to re-start the talks with the United States which remain stalemated after a working-level meeting last month broke down.
While undertaking negotiations with Washington, North Korea has demonstrated progress in conventional weapons development.
South Korean lawmakers said on Friday an intelligence agency reported increased movement in vehicles and equipment at the Tongchangri missile launch site that Pyongyang said it had demolished last year.
Early this year, it tested new missiles with similar features to Russia's SS-26 Iskander which are relatively small yet easier to hide, launch and maneuver in flight.
North Korea has demanded biting sanctions be lifted and warned it could take a ""new path,"" raising concerns it may resume nuclear and long-range missile testing suspended since 2017.
U.S. top nuclear negotiator Stephen Biegun said last week the year-end deadline was an artificial one, but could mean a return to ""provocative"" steps that preceded the past two years of diplomacy."

Australia has been battling wildfires for weeks, which have killed at least four people, burnt about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroyed more than 500 homes.
The rallies, in Sydney and other major Australian cities, were the first in a series of protests by students across the globe demanding governments do more to protect the environment. The protests come ahead of the annual U.N. climate conference that starts in Madrid on Monday.
Holding home-made signs, including ""The climate is changing, why aren't we?"", protesters in Sydney accused the government of inadequate action in addressing Australia's bushfire crisis. Smoke from the bushfires in New South Wales state formed a haze overhead.
""Our government's inaction on the climate crisis has supercharged bushfires,"" said 18-year-old Shiann Broderic, one of the event's organizers, whose home was destroyed in a bushfire.
""People are hurting. Communities like ours are being devastated. Summer hasn't even begun.""
Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously rejected suggestions his government is not doing enough to address climate change.
Australia has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but recent data shows emissions are unchanged.
However, data released on Friday showed Australia's greenhouse gas emissions were roughly unchanged in the 12 months ended June.
The release of the data came as firefighters continued to battle more than 150 blazes still alight across the country that has left more than 5 million people residing in Sydney struggling under hazardous air pollution that has lingered for much of the last week.
While a cool change has eased the threat of more fires, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology on Thursday said much of the country will suffer from continued hot and dry conditions this summer, increasing the chances of more bushfires."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Members of a U.S.-Mexican religious community who lost relatives in a gangland massacre this month have come under fire from supporters of Mexico's government for pressing the United States to declare drugs cartels terrorist groups.
Three mothers and six children of dual U.S.-Mexican nationality were shot to death in a brutal attack by suspected drug cartel gunmen in the northern state of Mexico, sparking outrage and condemnation in the United States.
The victims belonged to breakaway Mormon families who came to Mexico from the United States decades ago, and some of their U.S. relatives launched a petition over the weekend asking the government to declare the drug cartels terrorist organizations.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he would have the gangs designated terrorist groups, stirring fears that he could send the U.S. military across the border to take them out, ramping up pressure on Mexico ahead of his re-election bid in 2020.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he would not accept any intervention from foreign powers.
Many social media users expressed support for Lopez Obrador and heavily criticized the petition directed to the White House, calling it treasonous and accusing the families of wanting to create a pretext for a U.S.-led invasion.
Twitter posts in Mexico often carried a Spanish language hashtags referring to the LeBaron family as traitors and asking them to leave the country.
""They've got double nationality so why don't they return to their country instead of selling us out,"" one such post read. ""All Mexicans feel unsafe but that doesn't make us ask for foreign intervention.""
Alex LeBaron, a former Mexican congressman and relative of some of the victims, called the accusations ""baseless"" and ""insulting"" in an interview.
""They're terrorists, these cartels, whether they are declared as such or not,"" LeBaron said. Previously, he rejected a U.S.-led intervention and instead called for cooperation to improve security for all Mexicans.
The La Mora community in Sonora, where members of the LeBaron as well as the Miller and Langford families live, is still in mourning. This year, they have not followed their tradition of opening their houses to locals on Thanksgiving.
On Dec 1, which marks the first anniversary of Lopez Obrador taking office, members of the community plan to protest violence in Mexico City."

Interstate 5 through the Grapevine area was closed early on Thursday morning and the California Highway Patrol said on Twitter it was working to clear stuck vehicles as snow kept falling. 
The storm was expected to bring heavy snow in the mountains and high winds across much of the Western United States before moving toward the Great Plains late on Friday, the National Weather Service said.
The agency added that areas of southern California and Arizona could see heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding. Blizzard warnings were issued for parts of Wyoming and South Dakota.
On Wednesday, scores of vehicles became stuck on Interstate 5 after a “bomb cyclone” - a supercharged winter storm caused by a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure - dumped up to four feet (1.2 meters) of snow in mountainous areas of the Pacific Northwest.

The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which spearheaded the protests against Bashir, welcomed the law, saying it included the dissolution of the former ruling party and the confiscation of its funds and property. 
""It is an important step on the path to building a democratic civilian state,"" the group said in a statement.
Implementation of the law will be a crucial test of how far transitional authorities are willing or able to go to overturn nearly three decades of rule by Bashir, who took power in a 1989 coup. 
The law was passed during a joint meeting of Sudan's sovereign council and cabinet that lasted several hours.
The meeting saw disputes over an article that bans people who took leading posts in the former regime from practicing politics, sources with knowledge of the proceedings told Reuters. 
Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said on Twitter that the law was not an act of revenge, but was rather aimed at preserving the ""dignity of the Sudanese people"".
""We passed this law in a joint meeting to establish justice and respect the dignity of the people, and safeguard their gains, and so that the people's looted wealth can be recovered,"" he added. 

Hamdok's government was formed in September after a power-sharing deal between anti-Bashir groups and the Transitional Military Council that ruled the country immediately after Bashir's overthrow.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge on Thursday ruled to free four volunteer firefighters jailed this week on accusations they had set fires in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest to drum up donations, according to court documents.
Michell Durans, a lawyer representing the four men, confirmed to Reuters that they had already walked free on Thursday after the judge's order.
""Justice has been restored,"" Durans said.
The firefighters operate in the Alter do Chao region in the northern Amazonian state of Para which saw a surge in forest fires earlier this year.
Para state civil police arrested the men on Tuesday as a ""preventive"" measure while they continued to investigate the cause of the fires, raiding the office of a separate nongovernmental organization called the Health and Happiness Project in the same operation.
Police said the Alter do Chao Fire Brigade took pictures and videos of the fires they set and used them to defraud donors, including one who gave 300,000 reais ($71,489.85) to the group.
Politicians and other NGOs fiercely criticized the arrest and the raid, saying it was part of a concerted attempt by the government to harass environmental groups.
On Wednesday, Cosmetics company Natura, which had partnered with Health and Happiness last year to provide sustainable ingredients for its products, expressed concern over the raid.
After the number of fires in Brazil's Amazon hit their highest point since 2010 in August, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro suggested that NGOs could be setting them.
Scientists and activists blame land speculators, farmers and ranchers for setting the fires to clear land for agricultural use, saying that deforesters are being emboldened by Bolsonaro's rhetoric promoting development over preservation.
The judge's ruling to free the firemen came shortly after the Para state governor said they would replace the police officer in charge of the investigation with the head of the special unit for environmental issues."

The ERC said its position on the formation of a new government between the Socialists and the left-wing Podemos party remained negative. But it said it agreed on ""the need for a political approach to a conflict which is of its nature political"". 
The Socialists said differences between the two parties remained but there was a ""shared will for dialogue"". 
The Socialist PSOE party, led by acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, have been left scrambling for support following an election win this month in which they fell short of a majority after Spain's fourth election in four years.
The PSOE's 120 seats, combined with the 35 won by left-wing Podemos, leave them short of a majority in the 350-seat parliament, giving the 13 elected lawmakers of ERC a potential kingmaker role in unblocking the political stalemate in Madrid.
The left-learning ERC would not join any government but its abstention during a formal parliamentary vote to form a government could pave the way for Sanchez to take office. However significant obstacles remain to any deal.
ERC said it was sticking to its demands for dialogue to take place between the Spanish government and the Catalan regional government without preconditions, for talks to follow a clear timeline and for guarantees that any commitment would be carried out.
Party officials have said talks between the Catalan and Spanish governments were a ""non-negotiable"" condition and that the separatist party would not give up on its intention to talk about independence, something the Socialists have so far rejected.

Many airlines, including flagship home carrier Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, South African Airways and Malaysia's AirAsia Group Bhd have cut flights to and from Hong Kong temporarily as a result of sometimes violent anti-government protests that have led to a sharp fall in tourist and business travel demand.
More than 5,800 people have been arrested since the unrest broke out in June over a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, the numbers grew in October and November as violence escalated.
Under more normal conditions, it is tough for airlines to get take-off and landing slots at Hong Kong's airport because it lacks capacity until a third runway will come into operation in 2024.
A ""use-it-or-lose-it"" rule stipulates an airline normally only keeps slots out of historic precedence if it can demonstrate it used them at least 80% of the time in the previous airline scheduling season.
The current winter season, which began on Oct. 27, ends on March 28, 2020.
Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department said in a statement to Reuters on Thursday evening that in order to provide airlines with greater flexibility in aircraft deployment to deal with the fall in passenger demand, the ""use-it-or-lose-it"" rule had been temporarily suspended for the winter season.
Airport Authority Hong Kong reported declines in October of 13% in passengers and 6.1% in the number of inbound and outbound flights - the steepest falls since the unrest began."

BAGRAM AIRFIELD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made a surprise Thanksgiving visit to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thursday and said he believed Taliban insurgents would agree to a ceasefire in America's longest war.
Trump's visit was his first to Afghanistan since becoming president and came a week after a prisoner swap between Washington and Kabul that has raised hopes for a long elusive peace deal.
""The Taliban wants to make a deal and we are meeting with them,"" Trump told reporters after arriving in Afghanistan after an overnight flight from the United States, kept secret for security reasons.
""We say it has to be a ceasefire and they didn't want to do a ceasefire and now they want to do a ceasefire, I believe. It will probably work out that way.""
Taliban leaders have told Reuters that the group has again been holding meetings with senior U.S. officials in Doha since last weekend, adding they could soon resume formal peace talks.
The Air Force One presidential plane touched down at Bagram Airfield late in the evening on Thursday, with White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien, a small group of aides and Secret Service agents. Two surveillance blimps flew overhead.
Trump met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and served turkey to some U.S. troops before sitting down to eat Thanksgiving dinner with them. He chatted and had his picture taken with some of the U.S. forces deployed there.
""What a great job you do. It's an honor to be here,"" he said.
RARE WAR ZONE VISIT
It was only the second trip to a war zone by a U.S. president who never served in the military and has often derided U.S. engagement in foreign conflicts as costly blunders. He traveled to Iraq in 2018 for a Christmas holiday visit with troops.
Trump was greeted upon his arrival by U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milley said on Wednesday that a successful outcome from peace talks on ending the 18-year war in Afghanistan could happen in the ""near term.""
Trump has wanted to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan since his days as a presidential candidate.
But talks between the Taliban and the United States collapsed in September after Trump called off a planned meeting with Taliban leaders at the U.S. Camp David presidential retreat, citing a surge in Taliban violence.
The U.S. military says it has ramped up strikes and raids on the Taliban since then, in a bid to pressure the insurgents back to the negotiating table.
Hopes for peace rose earlier this month, when the Taliban released American and Australian hostages.
But Ghani underscored the need for a halt in the fighting, saying on Twitter after meeting Trump: ""If the Taliban are sincere in their commitment to reaching a peace deal, they must accept a ceasefire.""
TRUMP EYES DEAL 'OR TOTAL VICTORY'
There are currently about 13,000 U.S. forces as well as thousands of other NATO troops in Afghanistan, 18 years after an invasion by a U.S.-led coalition following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States.
About 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed in the course of the Afghan conflict.
A draft accord agreed in September would have thousands of American troops withdrawn in exchange for guarantees that Afghanistan would not be used as a base for militant attacks on the United States or its allies.
Still, many U.S. officials doubt the Taliban could be relied upon to prevent al Qaeda from again plotting attacks against the United States from Afghan soil.
The U.S. military has said it can go down to 8,600 troops and still carry out an essential counter-terrorism mission in a country where both al Qaeda and Islamic State fighters would continue to pose a threat even after any Taliban peace deal.
Trump acknowledged U.S. troop levels were ""substantially"" coming down but did not provide a specific number.
At the same time, however, Trump suggested he was willing to have U.S. forces stay in Afghanistan for the long-term, if needed.
""We're going to stay until such time as we have a deal or we have total victory. And they want to make a deal very badly,"" Trump said."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's police and prosecutors can access confidential tax and financial information without a court order, the country's Supreme Court ruled on Thursday, clearing the way for authorities to reopen an investigation of the president's son.
A majority of the high court's justices voted to allow public prosecutors in financial crime investigations to have access to tax documents and data at the Federal Revenue Service and central bank's financial intelligence unit with no need for warrants.
Brazil has made strides toward increased transparency in recent years, after its infamous so-called ""Operation Car Wash"" probe uncovered one of the world's largest ever corruption schemes involving bribes for public sector contracts. 
Thursday's warrantless search ruling was seen as further helping anti-corruption hardliners by allowing the investigation into President Jair Bolsonaro's son Flavio, a senator, to move forward.
Flavio Bolsonaro has been under investigation for alleged irregular bank account movements in Rio de Janeiro when he was a state legislator. 
He has denied any wrongdoing and the probe was suspended earlier this year by Supreme Court Chief Justice Jose Antonio Dias Toffoli, pending Thursday's decision on warrantless access to financial data.
A spokesman for Flavio Bolsonaro declined to comment on the ruling.
Toffoli had argued that prosecutors should be restricted to working by court order and with judicial authorization.
Critics of his position said it could weaken Brazil's anti-corruption fight and undermine its bid to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

BAGHDAD/NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces shot dead at least 45 protesters on Thursday after demonstrators stormed and torched an Iranian consulate overnight, in what could mark a turning point in the uprising against the Tehran-backed authorities.
At least 29 people died in the southern city of Nassiriya when troops opened fire on demonstrators who blocked a bridge before dawn on Thursday and later gathered outside a police station. Police and medical sources said dozens of others were wounded.
Four people were killed in Baghdad, where security forces opened fire with live ammunition and rubber bullets against protesters near a bridge over the Tigris river, the sources said, and twelve died in clashes in Najaf.
In Nassiriya thousands of mourners took to the streets, defying a curfew to bury their dead after the mass shooting.
Video of protesters cheering in the night as flames billowed from the consulate were a stunning image after years in which Tehran's influence among Shi'ite Muslims in Arab states has been a defining factor in Middle East politics.
The bloodshed that followed was one of the most violent days since the uprising began at the start of October, with anti-corruption demonstrations that swelled into a revolt against authorities seen by young demonstrators as stooges of Tehran.
Iran closed the Mehran border crossing to Iraq on Thursday night because of security reasons, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported, citing a local border official.
""With attention to the recent events and the unrest in the country of Iraq the Mehran border has been closed from tonight,"" Mojtaba Soleimani, the manager of the border post said, according to Mehr. 
He said it was not clear when the border would reopen.
In Najaf, a city of ancient pilgrimage shrines that serves as seat of Iraq's powerful Shi'ite clergy, the Iranian consulate was reduced to a charred ruin after it was stormed overnight.
The protesters, overwhelmingly Shi'ite, accused the Iraqi authorities of turning against their own people to defend Iran.
""All the riot police in Najaf and the security forces started shooting at us as if we were burning Iraq as a whole,"" a protester who witnessed the burning of the consulate told Reuters, asking not to be identified.
Another protester, Ali, described the attack on the consulate as ""a brave act and a reaction from the Iraqi people. We don't want the Iranians"".
But he predicted more violence: ""There will be revenge from Iran, I'm sure. They're still here and the security forces are going to keep shooting at us.""
Iran's foreign ministry condemned the attack and demanded ""the Iraqi government's firm response to the aggressors"".
So far, the authorities have been unyielding in response to the unrest, shooting dead hundreds of demonstrators with live ammunition and tear gas, while floating proposals for political reform that the protesters dismiss as trivial and cosmetic.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has so far rejected calls to resign, after meetings with senior politicians that were attended by the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, the elite unit that directs its militia allies abroad.
Abdul Mahdi on Thursday summoned a senior military commander in Dhi Qar province, where Nassiriya is located, to Baghdad to explain why the situation had deteriorated, a military statement said.
""CUT THE HANDS""
In a statement that indicated more violence was to come, the military commander of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of paramilitary groups whose most powerful factions are close to Iran, suggested the overnight unrest in Najaf was a threat to Shi'ite clergy based in the city.
The paramilitary fighters would use full force against anyone who threatened Iraq's most senior Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis said in a statement posted on the PMF website.
""We will cut the hand of anyone trying to get near al-Sistani,"" he said.
Influential populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr issued a fresh call for the government to resign, while warning those who torched the embassy that they risked provoking a violent backlash from the authorities.
""Do not give them cover to end your revolution, and stay clear of religious sites,"" he said in a statement on Twitter. If the government does not resign, ""this is the beginning of the end of Iraq,"" he said.
Fanar Haddad, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute, said the government and its paramilitary allies could use the consulate incident to justify crushing the demonstrations.
""It sends a message to Iran, but it also works to the advantage of people like Muhandis,"" he said. The paramilitaries could use the consulate incident as ""a pretext to clamp down, framing what happened as a threat against Sistani.""
Sistani himself has appeared to back the protesters since the unrest erupted, calling on politicians to meet the popular demands for reform.

Authorities set up ""crisis cells"" in several provinces to try to restore order, a military statement said on Thursday. They would be led by provincial governors but include military leaders who would take charge of local security forces.

Auctioneers said they believed Napoleon may have owned the leather riding boots during his final exile in Saint Helena, an island in the Atlantic Ocean, after his defeat at Waterloo.
""It's difficult to separate these boots from the image we have of Napoleon,"" said Alexandre Giquello, the auctioneer who will conduct the sale.
""It's part of an icon, a universal one today, it's extraordinary to sell this type of item. We know very well that image of Napoleon throughout the world: the hat, the boots, and maybe the frock coat.""
They come in at a European size 40 (U.S. size 7, British Size 6.5) and match descriptions of Napoleon's boot orders placed with shoemaker Jacques in Paris' rue Montmartre, the auctioneer said. They were owned by Napoleon's final companion, Grand Marshal Bertrand, after the emperor's death in 1821, it added.
The boots were given to sculptor Carlo Marochetti to be used as a model for a sculpture of Napoleon riding a horse meant for his tomb.
Marochetti's son gave the boots to the early 20th century French senator Paul le Roux, whose family has owned the boots ever since, according to the auction description.

RIYADH/LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar's foreign minister has made an unannounced visit to Riyadh, two sources told Reuters, amid signs that a 2-1/2-year rift among U.S.-allied Gulf Arab states could soon subside.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met with senior Saudi officials last month, said one of the sources familiar with the trip, the highest-level visit since May when Qatar's prime minister attended an Arab summit in Mecca.
It was unclear if the visit, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, included a face-to-face with de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
U.S. Senator Chris Murphy said the minister's trip was ""an important move that showed openness to some dialogue between the two sides"".
""At the very least, I think the Saudis seem sincere in trying to figure out the path forward,"" he told Reuters
during a trip to Bahrain.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of backing terrorism. Qatar denies the charge and accuses its neighbors of seeking to curtail its sovereignty.
Kuwait and the United States have tried to mediate the rift, which has undermined Washington's efforts to confront Iran.
""The United States and Kuwait are keen to have this resolved and help rebuild trust in the Gulf,"" the first source said.
The boycotting nations set 13 demands for lifting the boycott, including closing Al Jazeera television, shuttering a Turkish military base, reducing ties with Iran and cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood.
When asked about the visit, a senior Qatari official said Doha has ""welcomed each and every opportunity to resolve the ongoing blockade through open dialogue and mutual respect of each country’s sovereignty.""
The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir told reporters last weekend Riyadh was still waiting for Doha to answer the demands.
Saudi Arabia, whose reputation was damaged by last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, is trying to boost its global image as it takes over the presidency of the Group of 20 countries.
Two Western officials told Reuters early efforts at internal reconciliation on Qatar seem to be underway.
A soccer tournament in Qatar kicked off on Tuesday with teams from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, in an apparent sign of improving ties.
A Gulf Arab diplomat said a regional summit expected early next month in Riyadh could lay the groundwork for improving ties which is more likely now than at any recent time.
""We see the Gulf kiss (with noses) coming,"" the diplomat said."
1332,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 02:25PM ET</span>",EU parliament condemns Cuba's detention of top dissident,"HAVANA (Reuters) - The European parliament joined the United States on Thursday in condemning Cuba's detention and reported mistreatment of leading dissident Jose Daniel Ferrer, whom the Communist government in Havana calls a U.S.-backed counterrevolutionary.
The move came a day after Cuban state television aired a report including footage from hidden cameras in Ferrer's jail cell apparently showing him in good health and falsely accusing a guard of hurting him.
Activists from his opposition organization the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) said the footage could have been staged or doctored.
Authorities arrested Ferrer, 49, two months ago on charges of assault, which his relatives and UNPACU said was an excuse to silence him.
""They are slandering my son and so preparing the way to condemn him,"" Amelia Garcia Vega, Ferrer's 76-year-old mother who lives in Florida, told Reuters by phone. ""He is innocent. My son is not a delinquent and does not attack anyone.""
While the European Union parliamentary resolution is non-binding and will unlikely derail the bloc's drive to normalize relations with Cuba, it underscores concerns about what some activists say is worsening repression in the one-party state.
The resolution states that lawmakers are concerned about ""persecution, harassment, attacks against peaceful dissidents, independent journalists, human rights defenders and political opposition in Cuba"".
It notes an EU cooperation agreement with Cuba ""includes a provision to suspend the agreement in the event of human rights violations"".
Cuba says the Trump administration is using Ferrer to undermine the government as part of its attempt to overthrow socialism in Latin America.
It accused the top U.S. diplomat in the island, Mara Tekach, of directing his activities. Wednesday's TV report showed her visiting Ferrer's home and said she was ""inciting him to disrespect the forces of public order"".
The U.S. government has denied the allegations and said it is simply carrying out a mission to support Cuba's rights defenders.
This month the U.S. embassy in Havana posted a video on social media in which Tekach appeared with Ferrer's wife, who accused authorities of torturing her husband and allowing his health to deteriorate so much he could not even embrace her during a visit.
Cuba's government has until recently been able to tightly control the flow of information on the island and it does not usually comment on the detention of dissidents or their activities, which would give them more publicity.
But internet access has expanded vastly in recent years and Cuban activists, international rights organizations and the U.S. government have waged an intense campaign for Ferrer's release.
In the most controversial section of the state TV report, Ferrer could be seen hitting his head on a desk then accusing a guard of harming him.
The report also included Cubans saying Ferrer has hit them.
Ferrer was one of the 75 dissidents arrested in 2003 during a nationwide crackdown known as the Black Spring. He was released on parole in 2011 and soon after formed UNPACU."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A group of Chileans who claim to have suffered eye trauma in confrontations with the security forces rallied outside the presidential palace on Thursday to call for President Sebastian Pinera to ""take responsibility"" for human rights violations during the ongoing protests.
The group´s coordinator Marta Valdes Recabarren, whose 17-year-old son Edgardo partially lost sight in his left eye after a tear gas cannister hit him during a protest on Oct. 18, said rallies outside La Moneda would continue until Pinera ""takes responsibility for the repression of the Chilean people.""
""We cannot return to the impunity of 1973,"" she said, referring to the year General Augusto Pinochet led a coup in Chile. ""This should not be happening in Chile in 2019.""
For more than five weeks now peaceful protests and violent riots have taken place across Chile over low wages, the high cost of living and persistent inequality.
At least 26 people have been killed, more than 13,000 have been injured and 25,000 have been detained amid demonstrations, looting and arson attacks on supermarkets, metro stations, hotels and churches.
The Chilean Ophthalmological Society said 221 people had suffered from severe eye trauma in the demonstrations, mostly due to police rubber bullets.
Pinera has vowed that any violations of human rights by security forces will be investigated.
But he has also hardened his tone again to address those behind the frequent surges in violence that on Tuesday night saw almost 100 arson and looting attacks and clashes with police recorded around the country by the interior ministry.
On Thursday he said police were facing a ""powerful and implacable enemy.. working with professional planning and unlimited evil.""
Without identifying the perpetrators, he urged recruits at a police training academy to act with neither ""ambiguity or half-measures"" towards ""hoodies, looters and vandals, nor those who put up barricades or obstruct traffic.""
Rafael Zambrano, 23, said he suffered a detached retina and head injuries after police fired a water canon on him at close range during a protest in central Santiago. He rejected the suggestion the violence was driven by criminality.
""We ARE fighting a powerful enemy: President Pinera and his security forces,"" he said. ""What threat was I to police? I had no way to harm them, just words.""
The economic impact of Chile´s unrest on Thursday saw the local peso currency plummeted to a new low for the second day in a row at market close to 828.2 per dollar.
Chilean police did not respond to a request for comment."

""Good News, New York City: the winds are holding and the #MacysThanksgivingDayParade balloons will FLY!,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a tweet early on Thursday.
Concerns had been mounting earlier in the week over a forecast of strong winds on Thanksgiving Day. 
City regulations that were put in place after a Cat in the Hat balloon knocked down a lamp post in 1997, injuring four spectators, say the inflatable characters must be kept out of the sky sustained winds top 23 miles per hour (37 km per hour), and gusts exceed 34 mph (54 kph).
Many of the massive helium-inflated balloons require up to 90 handlers and can be challenging to maneuver even in calm weather. 
The giant balloons, including a 49-feet (15-m) tall Snoopy beagle decked out in astronaut gear to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing, and numerous floats will parade down Manhattan's 6th Avenue during the iconic celebration that began in the 1920s. 
Thousands of onlookers lined the city streets to watch the 93rd parade with its marching bands, clowns and performances expected to attract millions of viewers across the country. 

In Philadelphia, local media reported early Thursday morning that high winds had forced authorities to ground balloons for the city's Thanksgiving Day parade.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain holds an election on Dec. 12, a political gamble by Prime Minister Boris Johnson who sees it as his best chance to break the deadlock in parliament over Brexit.
The parties are on the campaign trail, traveling the length and breadth of the United Kingdom to drum up support.
Following are some colorful snapshots from the election trail:
HE'S GOT RHYTHM?
Boris Johnson visited a college in southwest England on Thursday, where he was invited to clap along to the pupils' performance of ""Lovely Day"" by Bill Withers.
Despite an enthusiastic conductor and well-drilled student choir, Johnson looked uncomfortable as he struggled to stick to the beat.
He then stood before the choir while they performed the same song in Makaton - a sign language that supports spoken English. This time he sang along, but kept his arms firmly by his side.
ONE DOWN, QUITE A FEW TO GO
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to plant 300 million trees across the country during his first five years in office if he wins power next month - starting with one in the garden of the official prime ministerial residence. 
Speaking at the launch of his environmental agenda in Southampton, Corbyn - a keen gardener who tends a vegetable plot in North London - said he had been looking after a sapling given to him by climate change protesters earlier this year.
""I've got a very nice hornbeam tree in a pot in my back garden which I was given by climate extinction people ... I've been looking after it very, very carefully, and very, very well, and I can find a really nice place to plant it,"" he said.
299,999,999 to go.
'GET BREAKFAST DONE'
During an election campaign, the 0810 GMT interview slot on BBC Radio 4 is the big one. It's where ministers, or their equivalents in rival parties, go to promote (and defend) their latest policy announcement while the nation eats its breakfast.
On Thursday it was Conservative health minister Matt Hancock's turn, responding to criticism by the opposition Labour Party about possible U.S. involvement in British healthcare.
Hancock batted back and forth several times with his interviewer, saying the nation's National Health Service was not for sale, until he was apparently caught out by a shorter-than-usual question.
Twitter users were quick to pick up on what sounded to them like Hancock talking with his mouth full.

Responding to one comment shortly after the interview ended, he neither confirmed nor denied he had been caught eating on-air, but did suggest a possible new campaign slogan: ""#GetBreakfastDone"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - Breaking a month-long lull in missile tests, North Korea fired two short range projectiles into the sea off its east coast on Thursday in what appeared to be the latest try out of its new multiple rocket launchers, South Korea's military said.
The test-firing came as the clock ticks down on the year-end deadline that Pyongyang had given the United States to show flexibility in their stalled denuclearization talks.
It also coincided with the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, and took place one day before the second anniversary of the North's test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said the North fired the two projectiles into the sea from launchers in the eastern coastal town of Yonpo at around 5 p.m. (0800 GMT).
The rockets traveled up to 380 km (236 miles) and reached an altitude of 97 km (60 miles), the JCS said.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the launch was a threat not only to Japan but the region and beyond, though his defense ministry said the projectiles did not enter Japanese airspace or its Exclusive Economic Zone.
""We will remain in close contact with the United States, South Korea and the international community to monitor the situation,"" Abe told reporters.
The launch is the first since Oct. 31, when the North tested what it called super-large multiple rocket launchers, which had also been used in tests conducted in August and September that were overseen by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
South Korea's military expressed ""strong regret"" and urged the North to stop stoking military tension.
""Such acts by North Korea are unhelpful for efforts to ease tension on the Korean peninsula,"" Jeon Dong-jin, director of operations at the JCS, told a news briefing.
LOOMING DEADLINE
Kim has set an end-year deadline for the talks with Washington, but negotiations have been at an impasse after a day-long working level meeting on Oct. 5 ended without progress.
North Korea has been demanding the lifting of sanctions that are hobbling its economy, and Kim set the deadline for Washington to show more flexibility in April, raising concerns he could resume nuclear and long-range missile testing suspended since 2017.
U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun said last week the year-end deadline was an artificial one, but could mean a return to ""provocative"" steps that preceded the past two years of diplomacy.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who is seeking re-election next year, has repeatedly pointed to Kim's suspension of long-range missile and nuclear bomb tests as a major achievement of his engagement with North Korea.
Analysts believe Pyongyang is trying to send a Thanksgiving reminder to the United States by demonstrating progress in weapons development on the anniversary of the 2017 ICBM test.
""Today's launch fit a North Korean pattern of escalating pressure on Washington and Seoul ahead of Kim Jong-un's year-end deadline,"" said Leif-Eric Easley, who teaches international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.
North Korean officials have warned the United States to abandon its hostile policy toward the North or Pyongyang would walk away from the talks.
The North has also demanded the abandonment of joint military drills by the United States and South Korea, which it calls preparations for an invasion.
The test comes a week after South Korea pulled back from a decision to scrap an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, an important element of security cooperation between the key U.S. allies in the region.
A senior Trump administration official said on Thursday that it was aware of reports of a North Korean missile launch.
""We are continuing to monitor the situation and consulting closely with our allies in the region,"" the official said.
The Pentagon referred Reuters to the U.S. Forces Korea for comment. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment."

The number of protesters has gradually fallen from a 250,000-person march and initial strike last week.
Demonstrators are rallying against economic plans - such as a rise in the pension age and a cut to the minimum wage for young people - that President Ivan Duque denies supporting, as well what they say is a lack of government action to stop corruption and the murder of hundreds of human rights activists.
The injury and eventual death of 18-year-old protester Dilan Cruz has also motivated demonstrators, who are calling for the ESMAD riot police to be dissolved.
The visibility of the ESMAD force during protests has been significantly reduced since Cruz was injured on Saturday.
The country's forensic medicine department confirmed on Thursday that Cruz had been killed by a projectile launched by the ESMAD.
Protests attracted thousands of demonstrators to several places around Bogota and in other cities on Wednesday, with the ESMAD making a late night appearance to disperse a crowd in the north of the city.
The head of the Central Union of Workers (CUT), part of the group of unions and student organization which called the original strike, urged people to join a strike next week.
""We are going to focus all our efforts so it is felt in the whole country,"" CUT president Diogenes Orjuela told a local TV channel late on Wednesday.
The protests have caused problems for Duque's proposed tax reform, with opposition parties leveraging demonstrations in a bid to force the government to make significant changes.
""The strategy of the government seems to be to hang in there until Dec. 8, when Christmas season starts,"" said analyst Sergio Guzman of Colombia Risk Analysis. ""The marches have now lost their greatest asset - the diversity of protesters.""
But the new year may bring new challenges for the embattled Duque, Guzman said.
""The deeper problems remain and the protests could be revived next year.""
Protests, which were marked by isolated looting and curfews on Thursday and Friday, have caused widespread transport problems in Bogota, with commuters forced to walk for hours to reach their homes as demonstrators blocked roads.
Marches are planned along at least two routes in Bogota on Thursday afternoon."

First, there was a tweet from the opposition National Party saying its candidate Luis Lacalle Pou had won. ""Uruguay now has a new president,"" it said.
Minutes later, also by way of Twitter, Daniel Martinez of the ruling Broad Front party conceded defeat.
""We congratulate president elect Luis Lacalle Pou, with whom I will meet tomorrow,"" Martinez tweeted.
In a region undergoing political upheaval, Uruguay's swing to the right marks a shift in the farm-driven South American nation, known for its cattle ranches and liberal policies on legalized marijuana and abortion rights.
Broad Front, the ruling party for 15 years, has overseen a period of stability and growth. But it came under pressure recently from a slowing economy caused in part by global trade woes and bad crop weather that dented agriculture.
A slow count of the vote had been leaning by about 1 percentage point in favor of the conservative candidate since Sunday. ""The tendency did not change as the vote count was scrutinized further,"" Martinez tweeted.
With economic growth slowing, job security fraying and holes in social safety nets widening, a wave of protests have spanned vast parts of South America including Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile.

While neighboring, inflation-hit nation Argentina does a political left-turn back to Peronism, Uruguay has generally been stable despite a lackluster economy that has put upward pressure on unemployment.

The incident took place in the early hours of May 30 after the women, in their 20s, boarded a night bus in West Hampstead. A fight ensued which left both women bloodied, with facial wounds after they were punched several times and a phone and a bag were stolen.
One of the women, Melania Geymonat, 28, told BBC radio at the time that the group began harassing them when they discovered she and her girlfriend Chris were a couple.
""They surrounded us and started saying really aggressive stuff, things about sexual positions, lesbians and claiming we could kiss so they could watch us,"" she said.
On Thursday, two boys aged 16 and a 15-year-old pleaded guilty at Highbury Magistrates' Court to offences including committing an aggravated hate crime and handling stolen goods. They will be sentenced on Dec. 23.

A bloodsoaked T-shirt suspended next to a row of bloodsoaked flags. Tear gas grenades lined up in columns. Photo after photo of young men, on posters that bear the dates their government killed them.
What started as an ad hoc shrine to Iraqis killed in protests against government corruption has become a museum and memorial to scores of dead, a place of prayer and quiet reflection at the heart of Baghdad's Tahrir square.
After two months of protests against a government widely viewed as corrupt and beholden to outside powers, Iraqis young and old have been converging on the makeshift museum to pay respects.
Tahrir, at the base of a bridge that leads across the Tigris to the fortified Green Zone government compound, has become sacred ground.
""As an Imam, I prefer to pray and read the Koran here than doing so at the mosque,"" said Ibrahim Gharawy, an Islamic scholar in turban and robes. ""Reading the Koran and praying in this place angers the corrupt.""
Near the exhibits, protesters have set up a long table, where Korans lay open among lit candles and melted wax. Carpets are laid alongside for people to kneel and pray.
""According to the Koran, the martyrs who died should not go in vain. There are more than 450 martyrs in Baghdad alone,"" said a female student, whose face was veiled with a scarf of the black, red and white Iraqi flag. ""Praying for them is the least we can do. I hope we gain our rights and be victorious.""
Ahmed Qatethabet, a construction worker and protester, described the exhibition as a monument that would ""remain for generations to come.
""As we have opened it, the exhibition will remain in Tahrir forever,"" he said."

The lightning raid at the Gruenes Gewoelbe, or Green Vault, one of Europe's greatest collections of treasures, on Monday has left investigators baffled even though security camera footage showed two men breaking in through a barred window.
""We will stop at nothing to solve this case,"" the president of Saxony police, Horst Kretzschmar, and prosecutor Klaus Roevekamp said in a statement.
""By offering a reward of half a million euros for clues that lead to catching the perpetrators who broke into the Green Vault in Dresden on Monday, the investigators ... are taking a further important step in bringing back the stolen items and catching those responsible,"" they added.
Footage shows two men smashing a display cabinet containing jewelry with a hammer. Security guards saw the incident and quickly rang the police who arrived five minutes later but it was too late.
Most experts say the cultural value of the haul, which included three sets of 18th century jewelry, is greater than its market value. They fear it will be broken up and sold in smaller pieces.
The collection, which includes precious stones, sculptures and decorations some from gold and silver, was started in the 18th century by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony. It survived World War Two Allied bombing raids but ended up as Soviet war booty to be returned to Dresden in 1958.
The police also said the number of employees working on the case had been increased to 40 and the investigations were being led by the organized crime branch of Saxony state prosecutors."

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives smashed the record for the amount of money raised in the first fortnight of an election campaign on Thursday, while the unions turned on the taps to keep the opposition Labour Party in touch. 
Official spending data from the Electoral Commission showed that in the first two weeks of a campaign that will determine Britain's EU future, the Conservatives raised 8.6 million pounds compared with Labour's 3.7 million pounds. 
This is the second time this year Johnson has broken a record for political donations. Over the summer, he raised the most money by a British politician campaigning to lead their political party, underlining his popularity with donors.
Johnson, 55, hopes to win a majority on Dec. 12 to push through the last-minute Brexit deal he struck with the EU last month after the bloc granted a third delay to the divorce that was originally supposed to have taken place on March 29.
Following the first week of the campaign when the Conservatives raised 26 times more in political donations than Labour, the main opposition party narrowed the funding gap by raising 3.5 million pounds, nearly all from unions. 
The biggest came from the Unite union, which donated more than 3 million pounds, while the Communication Workers Union donated 425,000 pounds. The support means Labour has also broken its own record for fundraising in the early stages of an election. 
The Conservative money came from 61 different donors, including from hedge fund managers and the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal.
Nigel Farage's Brexit Party raised 2.25 million pounds, with a 2 million pound donation coming from businessman Christopher Harborne.
Despite the strong financial performance for the ruling party, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are currently outspending the Conservatives on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) adverts ahead of the election.
The pro-EU Liberal Democrats are currently spending the most on Facebook, with more than 212,302 pounds in the last week, according to Facebook data. 
Labour spent more than 175,000 pounds in the same period, while the Conservatives spent just over a tenth of that with an outlay of 18,298 pounds. 
Before the vote, all political parties must submit weekly reports setting out the donations they have received over 7,500 pounds. Labour say they raise more in small donations, which are not recorded in the Electoral Commission's figures.

In total, the political parties contesting the election raised 15.6 million pounds in the first two weeks, compared with 9.6 million pounds in the same period ahead of the last general election in 2017.

Former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield was in charge of the stadium in Sheffield, northern England, at an FA Cup semi-final match against Nottingham Forest 30 years ago.
The victims died in an overcrowded, fenced-in enclosure. Harrowing images of young fans crushed against metal fences, bodies lying on the pitch and spectators using wooden advertising hoardings as makeshift stretchers horrified the nation.
Police at first blamed the disaster on drunken fans, an explanation that was always rejected by survivors, relatives of the victims and the wider Liverpool community who spent years fighting to find out what had happened.
Later inquests and an independent inquiry absolved the fans of any responsibility. The latest verdict came in a re-trial at Preston Crown Court after a jury in April had initially failed to come to a verdict.
""I'm shocked and stunned by the verdict of the jury,"" said Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher died aged 18 in the disaster. 
""We, the families, have fought for 30 years valiantly,"" he told the BBC.
Mike Bendown, Director of the Independent Office for Police Conduct, said they recognized the verdict would be of huge significance for the families of the 96 victims.
""As there are still live criminal proceedings relating to the disaster we will not be commenting further at this time,"" he added, urging people not to prejudice those cases with comments online.
Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it was aware the verdict would be disappointing for the relatives.
""The disaster at Hillsborough 30 years ago has caused unimaginable suffering to the families of those who sadly lost their lives and to everybody affected by the tragic events of that day,2 said Sue Hemming, CPS Director of Legal Services.
""They were let down with the most catastrophic consequences imaginable. I know how important these proceedings have been to everyone, even though they came far too late.""
Graham Mackrell, the Sheffield Wednesday club secretary at the time of the disaster, was found guilty of a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act, in the previous trial.

Former South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent Donald Denton, the force's detective chief inspector Alan Foster and Peter Metcalf – are scheduled to stand trial on charges of perverting the course of justice next year.

Conditions in the huge open-air camp on the island of Lesbos were ""extremely disturbing"", United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said on a visit to Greece.
He also expressed misgivings about recent changes that Athens had made to its legal framework for granting asylum.
""Patience and hospitality is now less visible than before,"" Grandi told reporters in Athens.
On Wednesday, he visited Moria, a camp built for up to 3,000 people but now accommodating more than 15,000.
""Conditions in which people live are extremely disturbing. There is a big sense of despair and a lack of prospects makes the situation difficult,"" Grandi said.
Greece's new conservative government, elected in July, has taken a tougher stance to the migrant crisis compared to its leftist predecessor.
It says that a chaotic response by the Syriza administration contributed to overcrowding on the islands and virtually adopted an ""open door"" policy toward arrivals. It has also classed most recent arrivals as economic migrants rather than refugees.
The main gateway into the European Union for more than a million people fleeing conflict in 2015-16, Greece continues to be on the frontline of Europe's migration crisis and has seen a resurgence of arrivals via Turkey in recent months.
Athens has announced plans to shut overcrowded refugee camps on Aegean islands and replace them with holding centers to process new arrivals.
""I made clear to the government that UNHCR policy is against detaining asylum seekers,"" Grandi said.
Athens wants to move up to 20,000 people to the mainland by the end of the year, expecting the new facilities to be ready by July 2020.
Greece has repeatedly called for a cohesive policy from its European Union partners for an equitable distribution of challenges from the refugee and migration crisis.
""Europe has to get its act together,"" Grandi said.
The new European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has promised to present a proposal for a revamp of the EU's migration policies next spring."

The detainees are from the Iran-aligned movement that a Saudi-led military coalition has been fighting since March 2015, after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognized government in Sanaa.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which transported the detainees from Saudi Arabia to Yemen, said 128 people were being repatriated. On Tuesday, the coalition said it had released 200 prisoners. The reason for the difference in numbers was not immediately clear.
Reuters witnesses saw two ICRC planes carrying the detainees arrive at Sanaa airport.
""The ICRC sees the release as a positive step and hopes that it will spur further releases and repatriations of conflict-related detainees,"" the aid agency said in a statement. It said it had acted as a neutral intermediary and was not involved in any of the talks that preceded the release.
Riyadh has been holding informal talks with the Houthis since late September about a ceasefire, sources have said, as it seeks to exit an unpopular war after its main coalition partner the United Arab Emirates withdrew troops.
The United Nations is trying to restart political negotiations to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine.

The conflict is seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis, who control Sanaa and most big urban centers, say they are fighting a corrupt system.

""He is already the sponsor of the terrorist organization and constantly hosts them at the Elysee. If he says his ally is the terrorist organization... there is really nothing more to say,"" Cavusoglu said.
""Right now, there is a void in Europe, (Macron) is trying to be its leader, but leadership comes naturally,"" he told reporters in parliament. 
Last month, Macron met Jihane Ahmed, the spokeswoman for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), of which the YPG is a big part, to express France's solidarity with them in their fight against Islamic State in Syria.
Turkey considers the YPG as a terrorist group and has been infuriated by the supports its allies have given the group. The Turkish assault, launched on Oct. 9, was condemned by Ankara's NATO allies, including France.
NATO SUMMIT
Earlier on Thursday, Macron said that Turkey could not expect solidarity from NATO allies when it launched its offensive in northeast Syria as a ""fait accompli"".
Ties between Turkey and France have been strained in recent years, but Macron and Cavusoglu's comments on Thursday highlight growing tensions ahead of NATO's 70th anniversary summit in London next week.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Turkey was refusing to back a NATO defense plan for the Baltics and Poland until it got more political support for its fight against the YPG. On Wednesday, a Turkish source said the impasse stemmed from the United States' move to withdraw its support for a separate Turkey defense plan.
Asked about the stalemate, Cavusoglu said that NATO needed to act in a way that addresses the concerns of all its allies, but added that Ankara wanted to find a middle ground over the defense plan stalemate.
""We are not against this NATO plan for the Baltics. However, what is being requested for the Baltic countries should also be done for us. We are also allies,"" Cavusoglu said.

Police in 16 towns and cities from the Mediterranean island of Sicily to the Alps in northern Italy took part in the investigation, which was launched two years.
The probe revealed a ""huge and varied array of subjects, residents in different places, united by the same ideological fanaticism and willing to create an openly pro-Nazi, xenophobic and anti-Semitic movement"", a police statement said.
Police did not say how many people joined the group or how many arrests were made. In Italy ""defense of fascism"" and efforts to revive fascist parties are crimes.
The new party was called the Italian National Socialist Party of Workers and police showed off a range of Nazi paraphernalia, including swastikas and pictures of Adolf Hitler seized during searches of 19 properties.
They also found a large number of weapons, including pistols, hunting rifles and crossbows.
The group had forged links with extremist groups abroad, including in Portugal, Britain and France, police said.

Police in July found a huge stash of weapons, including an air-to-air missile, linked to far-right extremists, while in November two men connected to another group of Nazi sympathizers were arrested on suspicion of planning to attack a mosque.

Students will examine what the official description calls Portugal's ""painful past"". The optional course draws links between Portugal's colonial slave trade and modern slavery, as well as covering topics such as ethnic cleansing and genocide.
The course's main architect, Miguel Barros, president of the Association of History Professors, says a new approach to history is increasingly important as far right parties expand their influence across Europe.
""Portugal still thinks of itself as the 'good colonizer', and many say racism doesn't exist here. At the same time, we're seeing the extreme right grow and hate speech spreading online,"" Barros told Reuters. ""I want historians to counter that.""
Supporters say the course fills a vacuum in an educational system that fails to question Portugal's history of conquest in Asia and the Atlantic slave trade between Africa and Brazil. Portugal quit its last colonies only in the 1970s, when democracy arrived at home after decades of fascist rule.
But the curriculum -- and the attitude toward the country's past that it represents -- has been criticized, and not only by the nationalist right. Former foreign minister and parliament speaker Jaime Gama, a Socialist, called it ""perverse"".
""It's adhering to an ideology which is fashionable nowadays, particularly in Anglo-Saxon cultures, of confessing your sins so you can be absolved,"" he told Observador newspaper. ""It doesn't allow for any national symbols, any heroes.""
Historian Joao Pedro Marques, who has written extensively on the Portuguese slave trade, called it ""a platform for politically correct people to darken the past of this country and the West"".
Barbara Gois, a 28-year-old black Brazilian-Portuguese political activist, said the only problem with the course was that it is optional.
""Imagine what it is to sit through history classes where the only representation of black people is as passive slaves used for scientific experiments,"" she said. ""Our society is built off racism. I'm not surprised some people are getting defensive about this… but students should learn how it all fits together."""

LONDON (Reuters) - A Cambridge University college said on Thursday it would return an antique statue of a cockerel to Benin City in Nigeria, more than 120 years after the work was looted by British colonial forces.
The move by Jesus College will likely step up pressure on other institutions holding plunder from the historic Kingdom of Benin and other objects taken by British colonialists during the 19th century.
College staff said research had shown there was no doubt the cockerel had been looted from the Court of Benin, the seat of the once-mighty West African kingdom.
""This royal ancestral heirloom belongs with the current Oba at the Court of Benin,"" the college said on its website, referring to the traditional and still influential ruler of what is now part of modern-day Nigeria.
""I hope the other institutions follow suit!"" said Nigerian artist Victor Ehikhamenor, an advocate of the restitution of the Benin artworks to their city of origin, on Twitter.
British museums have long resisted campaigns for the return of Nigeria’s Benin Bronzes, Greece’s Elgin Marbles, Ethiopia's Magdala treasures and other loot, often citing legislation that bans them from disposing of their collections.
But the debate has heated up in recent years, particularly in Britain's universities, where students and campaigners have called for greater recognition of how the colleges benefited from colonial-era riches and funding.
Scotland's University of Glasgow said in August it would spend 20 million pounds ($24.4 million) to make amends for the financial support it received from people who profited from the slave trade.
SCATTERED COLLECTIONS
Oxford University has launched several projects aimed at tackling its relationship and links to colonialism, but in 2016 one of its colleges, Oriel, decided not to remove a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes.
Dan Hicks, a professor of archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, said Britain had reached a tipping point in the national dialogue about the restitution of looted objects.
""In the past, our attention on this matter was focused on national collections like the British Museum,"" he told the Guardian newspaper. ""But in reality such loot is held in dozens of institutions across the regions: city museums, art galleries and the collections of universities.""
The statue of the cockerel was given to Jesus College in 1905 by the father of a student and was on display in the dining hall until 2016, when it was put into storage following student protests over its provenance.
The British Museum, which has around 100 objects from Benin on display, announced last year that it would loan some of them to a new Benin Royal Museum in Benin City that is due to open in 2023.
Along with representatives from Nigeria and from museums in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, the British Museum is a member of the Benin Dialogue Group, which is working on the creation of the new Nigerian museum.
The idea is that the European museums would contribute objects from their collections, on a rotating basis, to the Benin City museum's displays. The British Museum has agreed a three-year loan that could potentially be extended.
""The loan is being developed in close dialogue with the Benin Royal Court and the Benin Royal Museum project team, although no final decisions have yet been made concerning specific objects,"" the British Museum said on Wednesday."

SMEDEREVO, Serbia (Reuters) - Chinese special police took part in their first joint training drills in Europe on Thursday, joining Serbia's elite anti-terrorist unit and local police in an exercise at a Chinese-owned steel mill outside Belgrade.
Machine gun fire and stun grenade blasts shook the plant in Smederevo, some 60 km east of the Serbian capital, as police from the two countries used three helicopters and 20 armored vehicles in a staged raid to rescue hostages.
Serbia's interior minister Nebojsa Stefanovic said he planned more cooperation with Chinese law enforcement agencies, saying Serbia was ""learning from a bigger and stronger"" country.
""China is not only our strategic partner, but also ... a friendly and a brotherly country,"" he told reporters.
Some 180 special police officers from China's Henan province participated in the exercise at the mill, which was bought by China's Hesteel in 2016 and employs a number of Chinese citizens.
China passed a law in 2015 allowing its forces to venture overseas on counter-terrorism operations, and has been seeking to extend its capacity to carry out remote missions in case it ever needs to rescue Chinese citizens. 
But Beijing's poor human rights record, especially in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, where the government says it faces a threat from Islamist extremists, means Western countries have been reluctant to help.
That has left China relying largely on countries with which it already cooperates on security, such as Russia and Pakistan.
Keen to boost ties with European nations, China deployed military medics to practice with colleagues from Germany for the first time in July.
Serbia's military and police forces hold regular drills with Russia and NATO member countries as the government tries to balance its goals of joining the European Union and maintaining ties with traditional allies.
China has extended loans worth billions of dollars to build railways, roads and power plants in Serbia, mainly using Chinese workers, as part of its Belt and Road project to open up trade routes for Chinese companies.
Chinese police officers were deployed in Serbia earlier this year to help their Serbian colleagues cope with a growing number of Chinese tourists and workers.
Electronics giant Huawei also plans to open a development center in Serbia and has begun a project with the government to develop facial-recognition software that would see hundreds of surveillance cameras mounted in Belgrade."

Epstein's suicide on Aug. 10, at age 66, came a little over a month after the well-connected money manager was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty.
London's Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) said it had received an allegation in 2015 of non-recent trafficking against Epstein and a British woman whom it did not name.
The allegation related to trafficking to central London in March 2001.
It concluded the following year that it would not launch a full criminal investigation as the focus would largely be on activities and relationships outside Britain.
""In August 2019, following the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the MPS reviewed the decision making and our position remains unchanged,"" the police said."
1354,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>",Macron tells army: 'all options open' in Sahel after Mali deaths,"By Richard Lough
PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday he has ordered his military to assess its operations against Islamist militants in West Africa and all options are open, after 13 soldiers died during a combat mission this week.
In his first public remarks since France suffered its heaviest single loss of troops for nearly four decades, Macron said those seeking to understand the cost of France's mission in the Sahel should witness a ceremony to honor the dead soldiers.
""France is acting in the Sahel on everyone's behalf,"" an emotional Macron told a news conference with NATO General-Secretary Jens Stoltenberg.
""Our mission there is important. Nevertheless, the situation we face compels me today to examine all our strategic options.""
France is the only Western country with a significant military presence waging counter-insurgency operations in Mali and the wider Sahel region south of the Sahara desert.
Macron said he had told his government and military top brass to look hard at the nature of France's operations in the region, adding, ""I told them all options are open"".
The 13 French soldiers were killed in Mali on Monday when two helicopters collided in the dark after being called in to provide air support during a combat mission to track down a band of Islamic State fighters.
As France mourns the dead commandos, Macron is under mounting pressure from leftist opponents and military analysts to draw up a concrete plan for the withdrawal of the 4,500 waging counter-insurgency operations in Mali and the wider region.
Thirty eight French troops have been killed in the West African Sahel since France sent troops to Mali in 2013.
On Wednesday, France's top general acknowledged France would never achieve a total victory over al Qaeda- and Islamic State-affiliated militants who have strengthened their foothold in a region spanning from Mauritania to Chad.
Macron's government denies France is bogged down in an intractable conflict. But Monday's deaths have provoked renewed public comparisons with the United States' drawn-out military involvement in Afghanistan.
Malian Foreign Minister Tiebile Drame said the comparison was unjust.
""The Sahel is Europe's southern border. It's normal that France has an interest,"" Drame told Radio France International.
France has, however, complained to European allies that it is bearing the brunt of a counter-terrorism operation that benefits all Europe.
Asked about burden sharing, Macron replied: ""If people want to understand what they call 'cost-sharing', they can come on Monday to the ceremonies France is organizing for the dead soldiers. There they will see the price."""
1355,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 09:01AM ET</span>",African migrants among 20 civilians killed in attacks on Yemen within a week: U.N.,"GENEVA (Reuters) - African migrants were among at least 20 civilians killed this week in two attacks on a market in northern Yemen where migrants are known to congregate as they make their way to wealthy Gulf states in search of a better life, the United Nations said.
The U.N. statement, issued on Thursday, did not specify the type of attacks on Al-Raqw market in Saada province, near the Saudi border, or say who was responsible, but said many of those killed or wounded were Ethiopians.
A Saudi-led military coalition has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen for nearly five years in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine.
An aid worker told Reuters there had been an air strike on the market on Nov. 20, followed a week later by artillery shelling. Many migrants pass by the market as they try to reach neighboring Saudi Arabia.
The U.N. statement said the first attack had killed 10 people and that a similar incident a week later killed 10 and injured 22, including four children.
""With each day, the cost of this war becomes more unbearable,"" Lise Grande, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, said in the statement.
Thousands of migrants arrive in Yemen every year, mostly from the Horn of Africa, driven by drought and unemployment at home and lured by the wages available in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states.
The Houthis, who ousted Yemen's internationally recognized government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014, hold most big urban centers in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country."

Russia has called on the United States and other countries to declare a moratorium on the deployment of short and intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe after a treaty banning such a move formally ended in August.
Macron, who met transatlantic alliance NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Paris for talks on Thursday, said France had ""absolutely not accepted"" the proposal. 
""But we considered that, as a basis for discussion, we shouldn't just brush it off... Let's be serious, this is the security of Europe we're talking about,"" he said. 
The Cold War-era Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) between Russia and the United States banned land-based missiles with a range of 310-3,400 miles, reducing the ability of both countries to strike at short notice.
France has said European Union (EU) states want to play a role in negotiations after the demise of the pact. 
On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Macron had replied to a moratorium proposal from President Vladimir Putin. NATO has called the proposal not ""credible"" and said Moscow has already deployed illegal missiles, something Russia denies.
""Of course, (Macron's) answer is not detailed. But at least, it expressed an understanding of (Russia's) concern and a readiness for dialogue on this score,"" Peskov was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying. 

The spokesman said Macron and Putin would discuss the proposal in Paris on Dec. 9, TASS news agency reported.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 08:37AM ET</span>",Dark horse candidate opens up leadership race in Germany's far-right AfD,"By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - An Alternative for Germany (AfD) lawmaker known for his strident criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal immigration policies has decided to run for the leadership of the far-right party, complicating a fight over its future.
Gottfried Curio, a physicist and musician, announced his surprise candidacy on YouTube, where his rhetoric against Muslims has turned him into a star with almost 52,000 followers.
He will run against Tino Chrupalla, a lawmaker from the eastern state of Saxony favored by senior AfD members, a party official said.
The leadership vote by AfD delegates at a congress on Saturday will decide the future direction of the party, which has upended German politics since entering the national parliament two years ago as the third largest force.
""Curio is an eloquent speaker who knows how to fire up a crowd,"" an AfD lawmaker said, on condition of anonymity. ""But many doubt he has the skills to hold the party together and rally support behind a program that guarantees more success.""
The AfD leadership is currently shared by Alexander Gauland, a 78-year-old patriarchal figure seen as a unifying force, and Joerg Meuthen, a European Parliament lawmaker.
""Gauland and the party board want Chrupalla. He is not our best speaker but he knows how to campaign and win elections,"" said the AfD lawmaker.
Gauland has indicated he might run again for the leadership if he doubts the quality of the candidates.
""Gauland would win re-election hands down,"" the lawmaker said. ""But he prefers to step down given his age and health. He might have to reconsider if he feels Curio has a good chance.""
Chrupalla, a former decorator who has appeared in a report by the domestic intelligence agency about the AfD for possible links to far-right militants, is backed by Bjoern Hoecke, AfD leader in the eastern state of Thuringia who leads a radical wing within the AfD.
""Regardless of what happens at the party congress, it is clear the AfD is becoming more radical,"" said Matthias Quent, Director of the Institute for Democracy and Civil Society.
Though he lacks the support of Gauland and Hoecke, Curio has wasted no effort in trying to sell his pitch.
""The AfD must help the police and justice system remedy the loss of control,"" he said, referring to Merkel's 2015 decision to welcome one million asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa. ""This includes the loss of the public space from parks which are becoming open markets for African drug dealers."""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers declared a ""climate emergency"" on Thursday in a symbolic vote that heightens pressure for action against global warming at an upcoming summit.
With increasingly erratic weather patterns from wildfires in Australia to floods in Europe being linked to climate change, governments are under scrutiny to find urgent solutions at the United Nations' summit in Spain on Dec. 2-13.
After a debate on Monday night, the European Union (EU) legislature voted in favor of the declaration with 429 lawmakers for, 225 against and 19 abstaining.
""It is not about politics, it is a matter of our common responsibility,"" said parliament's environment committee chairman Pascal Canfin of the Renew Europe group.
Dissenters objected to the word ""emergency"", saying it was too drastic, and ""urgency"" would suffice.
Frustrated scientists and activists warn that despite such declarations, action is still lagging to hit the Paris Agreement target of curbing emissions enough to keep temperature rises to within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels.
However, the EU parliament's vote should help shape policies for the bloc's incoming executive head, Ursula von der Leyen, who assumes office on Dec. 1.
The 28-nation EU is the first multilateral bloc to call a climate emergency, but joins numerous individual countries and cities from Argentina and Canada to New York and Sydney.
Lobby groups were pleased but wanted more action.
""Five years ago, no one would have expected the European Parliament to declare a climate emergency, so there's some progress,"" said Greenpeace's EU pointman Sebastian Mang, adding that ""drastic cuts"" in emissions must follow.
Von der Leyen is slated to speak on the first day of the Madrid summit. She wants to see billions of euros invested into making Europe the first ""climate neutral"" continent - adding no greenhouse gases beyond what can be absorbed - by 2050."

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday accused Russia of helping Syria conceal the use of banned toxic munitions in the civil war by undermining the work of the global chemical weapons agency trying to identify those responsible.
The comments by the U.S. representative to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), Kenneth Ward, drew a rapid denial from Moscow and came as Western powers and Russia clashed at the agency's annual conference in The Hague.
Moscow has for months cited dissent by two former OPCW employees who leaked a document and an email as evidence that the OPCW doctored the conclusions of a March 1 report which found that a toxic chemical containing chlorine was used in a 2018 attack near Damascus.
More than 40 people were killed in that attack in Douma, a town on the outskirts of the capital then held by rebels, on April 7, 2018.
The United States, Britain and France retaliated a week later by firing missiles at Syrian government targets, the biggest Western military action against the Damascus authorities of the eight-year-old war.
Syria and Russia deny there ever was a chemical attack in Douma, saying the event was staged using bodies brought from elsewhere, and that the OPCW's report on Douma was doctored to justify Western military intervention.
The OPCW has become the battleground for a diplomatic clash on Syria after Russia in 2017 vetoed a resolution to extend the mandate of the U.N.-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), which concluded in a series of reports that the Syrian military used both nerve agent sarin and chlorine as weapons.
The OPCW's own Investigation and Identification Team (IIT), which was established by a clear majority vote by its member states in June 2018, is looking into who was responsible for the Douma attack, among several other incidents.
Its first report is expected next year.
Russian Ambassador to the OPCW, Alexander Shulgin, repeated objections to the creation of the IIT, saying it was illegal and politicized. Syria's representative to the OPCW on Thursday vowed not to cooperate with the IIT's investigations.
Ward said Russia and Syria were merely seeking to cover up the use of chemical weapons by undermining the OPCW.
""Unfortunately the Russian Federation has played a central role in this cover-up,"" Ward told delegates. ""Russia and Syria may sit with us here, but they stand apart from us in a fundamental way. They continue to embrace chemical weapons.""
Shulgin rejected the U.S. claim that Russia was helping Syria cover up chemical crimes carried out by the Syrian regime.
""It is exquisite rhetoric... But these assertions do not hold water. We disagree,"" Shulgin said."
1360,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 07:55AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Daphne murder accused details plot to kill for 150,000 euros","By Stephen Grey
VALLETTA (Reuters) - One day in the summer of 2017, Vince Muscat dropped his friend Alfred Degiorgio at the Busy Bee, a harbour-front café near Malta's capital renowned for its pastries stuffed with ricotta cheese. Degiorgio didn't stay long.
A few minutes later, he jumped back into the car to report to Muscat that they had a contract: To kill the island's top journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia.
Daphne was blown up by a car bomb on Oct. 16, 2017. The murder shocked Europe and revealed the island's violent, criminal underbelly. For years Daphne had run a popular blog famous for its punchy political opinions and allegations of corruption. It had made her many enemies.
This is the previously untold account of the plot to kill Daphne, a contract killing that earned the killers just 150,000 euros. Muscat revealed these sensational details to the police in April 2018, in the hope of getting a pardon. Details of his confession were passed to Reuters last year but were not published until now to avoid damaging the investigation.
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat (no relation) has so far refused Vince Muscat's request for a pardon, even as he granted a pardon and immunity from prosecution to another figure in the plot, a taxi driver called Melvin Theuma. Theuma has admitted police that he acted as a middleman between the killers and the person or people who ordered Daphne's murder. He has been released under police protection, according to a police source, and is due to testify in court on Friday.
""It's a complete injustice that Theuma should give evidence against Vince when Vince was the one that led police to him and helped solve this case. He is the one who should be pardoned, not Melvin,"" said Pauline Muscat, Vince's wife, speaking publicly for the first time.
Officials said Theuma was arrested on Nov. 14 as part of a separate investigation into illegal gambling, however. After his detention, he offered information about Daphne's killing and provided evidence that led to the arrest six days later of Yorgen Fenech, one of Malta's leading businessmen, they said. Fenech is being questioned by police.  Fenech's lawyer declined to comment and Theuma's lawyer didn't respond to a request for comment.
SEEKING A PARDON
The first arrests in the investigation took place on Dec 3, 2017 when Muscat and his two alleged accomplices, brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio, were charged with Daphne's murder. All three denied the charges. After lengthy preliminary hearings, they were indicted in July to stand trial by jury at an undetermined future date.
Muscat, who was known to police for minor misdemeanors, including importing birds, agreed to spill the beans in April 2018 after police said his statement would only be used as evidence if Muscat obtained a pardon. A person briefed in detail about Muscat's confession relayed the contents to Reuters. Muscat told police that the killers were paid 150,000 euros to murder Daphne, with 30,000 euros delivered upfront, this person said. They used a bomb bought from Maltese gangsters and supplied by the Italian mafia.
Police have said they believe Muscat was a henchman for George Degiorgio, known by the nickname ""Ic-Ciniz"" (the Chinese), leader of an organized crime group. Alfred Degiorgio, known as ""Il-Fulu"" (the Bean), was a member of the same gang, according to police. The brothers continue to deny Daphne's murder and have declined to answer police questions. Marc Sant, a lawyer defending Vince Muscat, declined to comment, as did lawyers for the brothers.
In interviews with police, Muscat named Theuma, the taxi driver, as the middleman who arranged Daphne's killing, the person familiar with his confession said. Muscat drove Alfred Degiorgio to several meetings with Theuma, Muscat told police. He said he didn't hear the two men's discussions about killing Daphne, but Alfred Degiorgio briefed him after each meeting. Details of the meetings were also relayed by Alfred to George Degiorgio, Muscat said.
According to Muscat's account, after getting the contract to kill Daphne, the plotters first decided to shoot her and bought a rifle with telescopic sights. Muscat told investigators the rifle was supplied from Italy, and that Alfred Degiorgio was to fire the weapon.
The gang began their work by watching Daphne's movements, tailing her car and observing her home, according to Muscat's confession. They identified a window where she often sat while working on her laptop. At one stage, sandbags were placed on a wall which had a view of the window to provide a stable rest for the rifle.
Muscat told investigators how, as surveillance continued, they followed Daphne on a family outing to the Phoenicia Hotel, by the gates of Malta's capital Valletta, and to the airport when she and her husband, Peter, went on a foreign trip.
Muscat said that Theuma had helped watch the couple's car in the airport carpark to identify when she returned home. A member of Daphne's family confirmed she had visited the Phoenicia Hotel on Aug. 17 and 26 and had traveled abroad with Peter from Sept. 16 to Sept. 21.
After their scouting operation, the gang decided, for reasons not yet explained, that it would be too difficult to shoot Daphne, according to the account of Muscat's confession given to Reuters.
Returning the rifle to the supplier, they were then provided with a bomb and shown how to detonate it, according to Muscat. Police say they have identified those suspected of supplying the weapons and hope to make arrests soon.
COMPOUND
Daphne lived in the village of Bidnija where she had a house in a walled compound. She usually parked her car inside the compound. That posed an obstacle to her would-be killers, who needed access to her vehicle to place the bomb. In case they had to climb into her garden to reach the car, they devised a special leash to control the dog that ran around inside.
But on the evening, Oct. 15, 2017, Muscat and the Degiorgio brothers realized the car had been parked outside the gate to the compound. In an interview with Reuters, Daphne’s son, Matthew, previously described how he had parked the car in the road that night, something he did quite often.
In the early hours of Oct. 16, police have said in court, the two Degiorgios and Muscat went to Bidnija to plant the bomb.
The person briefed on Muscat's confession said Muscat alleges Alfred broke into the car by levering open the rear-quarter window passenger side. With George watching out from a high vantage point, and Muscat watching the lane outside Daphne's house, Alfred crept inside the car and put the bomb under the driver's seat.
In court hearings, police described how telephone data revealed that George Degiorgio later boarded a yacht and was in the Grand Harbour of Valletta when Daphne left her home just before 3 p.m. on Oct. 16.
According to the prosecution case, George Degiorgio sent a text message from the yacht to a device inside Daphne's car which detonated the bomb and killed her.
According to Muscat's account, the balance on the cash price for her killing was handed to Alfred Degiorgio by Melvin Theuma within 10 days of the bombing at a place called Ramla Eaz in Zejtun in the south of Malta. Police sources declined to discuss details of any financial transactions. Lawyers for the brothers declined to comment."

Despite its sweeping economic reforms and openness to social change, the party does not tolerate criticism and its leader, Nguyen Phu Trong, has intensified a crackdown on dissidents and activists since being re-elected in 2016.
Pham Van Diep, a 54-year-old activist from the northern province of Thanh Hoa, was jailed for nine years for spreading ""distorted information defaming the Communist Party and the Vietnamese government"", the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said.
""He also spread fake and baseless news about the country's policies, which caused Facebook users and residents to misunderstand the party and the government,"" it added.
The posts were uploaded between April 2014 and June 2019, VNA said, adding that he had also been jailed for 21 months in Laos for spreading anti-Vietnamese literature there in 2016.
Separately, a court in the southern province of Dong Nai jailed a brother and sister on Thursday for a combination of 14 years on similar charges of anti-government posts on Facebook, the provincial police said in a statement on its website.
A spokesman for rights group Amnesty International said previously that at least 16 people had been arrested, detained or convicted this year for anti-government posts on Facebook. That figure does not include the three latest cases.
Another 12 political prisoners remain behind bars on similar charges, the spokesman said.
""CLIMATE OF FEAR""
In the other cases this month, a music teacher was jailed for 11 years on Nov. 15 over anti-state posts on Facebook and a 38-year-old man was jailed for broadcasts of 33 live video sessions.
The broadcasts aimed to ""encourage people to participate in protests during national holidays"", a court said.
Late last month, a 54-year-old architect was jailed for a year over the same charge.
Widely used in Vietnam, Facebook serves as the main platform both for e-commerce and the expression of political dissent. In May Facebook said it had increased more than sixfold the content in Vietnam to which it restricted access in the last half of 2018.
Amnesty and New York-based Human Rights Watch have decried curbs on freedom of expression that leave people facing arrest and jail for voicing their opinion, and have also urged Hanoi to halt a crackdown on an independent publisher.

""This crackdown has further exacerbated the prevailing climate of fear in Vietnam,"" the rights groups said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

VALLETTA (Reuters) - A prominent Maltese businessman has told police that former government chief of staff Keith Schembri was the mastermind behind the 2017 murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, two people briefed on the investigation said on Thursday.
Schembri was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the case. He has not issued any statement since his detention but has previously always denied any connection to the killing of Caruana Galizia, who wrote extensively about corruption.
Schembri's lawyers were not available for comment on Thursday when contacted by Reuters for comment.
Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, a close personal friend of Schembri, told reporters he hoped the murder investigation would be wrapped up within ""the next few hours"".
The two-year-old investigation has accelerated dramatically this month after fresh evidence was uncovered, leading to the arrest last week of businessman Jorgen Fenech, who was stopped as he tried to leave Malta on his luxury yacht.
According to police and legal sources with direct knowledge of the probe, Fenech is seeking legal immunity in return for testimony that would implicate Schembri and reveal a wide scheme of corruption on the island implicating senior politicians.
Under the law, a pardon can only be issued by the president, on the recommendation of Muscat's cabinet.
The sources did not indicate whether Fenech had provided any evidence to suggest that Schembri had masterminded Caruana Galizia's murder.
Neither Fenech nor his lawyers have made any public comment since his arrest.
PRESSURE TO QUIT
Muscat repeatedly dismissed accusations of wrongdoing leveled at his inner circle over the past few years and is now facing growing calls to resign because of his alleged failure to hold friends and colleagues to account.
His tourism minister quit earlier this week while the economy minister suspended himself from the government as the murder probe continued. Both denied involvement in the case that has raised questions about the rule of law in Malta.
""We are calling for (Muscat) to assume responsibility and resign from his leadership, from his premiership, and a new prime minister be appointed,"" said Karol Aquilina, an opposition lawmaker and a lawyer for Caruana Galizia's family.
Muscat has refused to stand down, saying Malta needs stability.
The government has already granted a pardon in the case to Malvin Theuma, the alleged middleman in the plot, who was arrested two weeks ago in a money laundering investigation and immediately offered information on the Caruana Galizia murder.
The journalist was killed by a car bomb on Oct. 16, 2017. Three men were arrested shortly afterwards and are awaiting trial for having allegedly set off the explosion.
Caruana Galizia had revealed the existence of a secret company, 17 Black, owned by Fenech, which was named in emails as being a vehicle for depositing money into the accounts of Panama companies owned by ex-Tourism Minister Mizzi and Schembri.
There is no evidence that money changed hands and Mizzi has said there are no links between him and 17 Black."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) on Saturday choose a new leader whose first task will be to decide whether to quit their ruling coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, possibly triggering a snap election.
Germany's oldest party is in turmoil after a run of dismal regional and European election results and a six-month long leadership race which has left them trailing in polls. Many members want to leave the government and rebuild in opposition.
However, that could prompt a snap election or minority government - both unsavory options for the SPD and for the conservatives, who are embroiled in their own power struggle for the post-Merkel era. After 14 years of leading Germany, Europe's biggest economy, she is not standing again as chancellor.
A 10-day ballot of the SPD's 426,000 members ends on Friday. The choice is between two leadership duos who topped a ballot last month - one pair led by pragmatic Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, the other by a leftist critical of the coalition.
The outcome is unclear.
""What differentiates these candidates is their stance on the grand coalition - that's what this is about,"" said Thomas Jaeger, politics professor at Cologne University.
The highest-profile candidate is Scholz, a centrist who has stuck to his conservative predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble's fiscal rigor, and would continue the coalition with Merkel.
Widely seen as frontrunner, he and his little-known running mate have the backing of the SPD establishment and lawmakers.
Yet a surprisingly strong challenge has come from Norbert Walter-Borjans, a former state finance minister, nicknamed Robin Hood for cracking down on tax dodgers with Swiss bank accounts.
He and his leftist running mate want to renegotiate the 2018 coalition deal to focus more on social justice and investment - if necessary with a budget deficit.
The conservatives are reluctant to reopen the deal but want to stay in power until the 2021 election. Merkel appealed to her partners on Wednesday in parliament.
""There's a lot still to do. I think we should carry on working for the whole term ... I'm in,"" she said.
Saturday's announcement, due around 6 p.m. (1700 GMT), will be rubber-stamped by delegates at a Dec. 6-8 party conference which will also vote on the coalition.
Whoever wins faces a mammoth task. In 2017, the SPD's share of the vote slumped to its lowest since 1933. It is now around 15% in polls, trailing the Greens and the conservatives and only just ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)."

MALE (Reuters) - Former Maldives president Abdulla Yameen was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for money laundering on Thursday - as dozens of his supporters gathered outside the courtroom saying his was innocent.
Yameen, who ran the Maldives with an iron hand for five years, unexpectedly lost an election last year and has since faced investigations over a number of deals sealed during his tenure.
He was accused of receiving $1 million of government money through a private company as part of a deal to lease a number of tropical islands for hotel development - charges he has repeatedly dismissed.
Judge Ali Rasheed, who headed a panel of five judges trying the case, told the criminal court it had been established beyond any reasonable doubt that Yameen had taken money that he knew was embezzled from the state.
""The judges took over 10 days to deliberate on this and this is the unanimous verdict of the five judges,"" Rasheed said.
Yameen drew the Indian Ocean island country closer to China during his tenure from 2013-2018. Opposition critics accused him of giving contracts, including a major bridge and an extension to the international airport, to Chinese companies at inflated prices. He denied any wrongdoing.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>","Taiwan pushes anti-infiltration bill, opposition cries foul","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan needs to have legal means to prevent China interfering in its politics, a government spokesman said on Thursday about a anti-infiltration law that is being drafted, as the main opposition said it feared being ""painted red"" by the law.
The legislation is part of a years-long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process on the island. China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary.
The ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party has begun a renewed push for the legislation this week, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 11.
They say there is extra urgency following allegations from a Chinese asylum seeker in Australia, Wang Liqiang, who told media there he was a spy who had worked to spread Communist Party influence in Hong Kong and meddle in Taiwan politics.
Chiu Chui-cheng, deputy head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said China's infiltration and interference in Taiwan was ""extremely severe"".
Other democracies take legal steps to stop such activities, and Taiwan must do so too, especially due to ""China's unwillingness to give up on annexing Taiwan, while using Taiwan's free and open environment to create division within society"", Chiu told reporters.
""We are right at the frontline of external threats and thus have an even more urgent need to strengthen the legal system to safeguard national security and the future of freedom and democracy.""
China has denied meddling in Taiwan, and says supposed spy Wang is a convicted fraudster who has made ""absurd"" claims.
Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, has expressed serious doubts about Wang's allegations, criticizing the DPP for using the accusations to seek electoral gain and smear their presidential candidate, Han Kuo-yu.
Speaking earlier on Thursday at a parliamentarian hearing regarding the law initiative, Charles Chen, who is running as a Kuomintang legislator, called the planned legislation a ""political tool"" for the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen to gain votes.
""Are they using the case of Wang Liqiang to rush the legislation, and paint the Kuomintang red?"" he said, referring to the color of the Chinese Communist Party.
""The legislation could easily become a political tool, especially during the elections,"" Chen added.
Kuomintang presidential hopeful Han said this week he would sue Wang if he ever came to Taiwan."

DURRES, Albania (Reuters) - Rescue teams desperately sought survivors under rubble in Albania's western town of Durres on Thursday hoping to pull out toddler twins alive, two days after a 6.4 magnitude quake killed at least 40 people.
Spared by killer quakes since 1979, Albania lacks rescue know-how. Italy, Greece, Romania and others rushed teams in and they are searching for survivors as 530 aftershocks, some with a magnitude over 5, kept rocking buildings and scaring people.
Berti Lala, 40, watched Italian rescue officers in the search for his twin son and daughter, barely two, his boy of six, his wife and paralyzed older brother. They were all on the second floor of a collapsed four-storey house, built in reclaimed marshland in Durres, Albania's main port.
His other daughter, Amelia, 8, his mother Sehadete, 79, and his niece Griselda, 23, were trapped and killed by the collapsing walls. His nephew Rame, 17, was pulled out alive
Working incessantly and methodically, the Italians drilled off chunks of concrete to be removed by hand. Afterwards a team of Albanian soldiers shoveled debris away energetically. A mechanized digger was called to move off more.
They stopped to poke lights into a furrow. No luck. Chipping off chunks of wreckage resumed. For a time only the crackle of shards of brick was heard in the night. The Italian team leader directed the Albanian digger operator with hand gestures.
Shortly before 4 a.m, a clothes hanger, blue and orange towels and a toolbox appeared.
A plastic shower base and a tiled wall were uncovered later, a sign the excavators had reached the third floor, above where the toddlers were trapped. The digger's forked bucket lifted a slab for the Italians to look below.
In the northern town of Thumane, where 22 people died, searches were halted after all victims were pulled out, including the bodies of a mother and daughter found embracing each other under the rubble of a five-storey building.
The quake on Tuesday, centered 30 km (19 miles) west of the capital Tirana, was felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia across the Adriatic Sea.
Some 45 people were pulled alive from under the rubble. A handful of the 650 injured are in a serious condition.
The government has declared a state of emergency for 30 days in the areas of Durres and Thumane, the worst affected, and promised it would build new houses by the end of next year for those who lost them.
The costs of the damage and reconstruction have yet to be determined. Two donor conferences have been mentioned and a wave of solidarity has spread in the Albanian Diaspora.
With festivities for Albania's independence day canceled, Interior Minister Sander LLeshaj distributed a photo of a rescue worker displaying a flag found under the ruins in Thumane shortly before midnight.
""For a few moments, it stopped the pain of mourning and brought back the light of hope,"" he said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)."

""Iran's scaling back of its nuclear commitments was implementation of its legal rights to react to America's illegal and unilateral exit of the deal and the European parties' failure to fulfill their obligations,"" Mousavi said in remarks quoted by state television.
""Under these circumstances, the deal does not allow triggering of the mechanism by the European parties to the deal ... such remarks by the French official are irresponsible and not constructive."" 
The mechanism involves a party referring a dispute to a Joint Commission comprising Iran, Russia, China, the three European powers, and the European Union and then on to the U.N. Security Council if that commission cannot resolve it.
If the Security Council does not vote within 30 days to continue sanctions relief, sanctions in place under previous U.N. resolutions would be reimposed - known as a ""snapback"".
France's foreign minister suggested on Wednesday that Paris was seriously considering triggering the mechanism, given Tehran's repeated breach of parts of the 2015 accord with world powers.
Under the deal, Tehran agreed to curb its sensitive nuclear work in return for lifting international sanctions. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the pact last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran. In reaction, Tehran has gradually decreased its commitments to the agreement. 

Iran has said it will further decrease its nuclear commitments if Britain, France and Germany fail to shield Tehran's economy from U.S. penalties.

Those freed are banker and publisher Suleiman al-Saikhan, former blogger Fuad al-Farhan, who later started a small business, and Bader al-Rashed, a journalist who had worked on one of the government's reform initiatives, ALQST tweeted.
Reuters was unable to reach them directly.
The men were among at least eight people taken from their homes earlier this month by plainclothes police. The reason was unclear as they are not considered frontline activists, though some had written previously about the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.
The Saudi government communications office has not responded to a request for comment on the arrests.
ALQST is an independent non-governmental organization that monitors and documents human rights violations it says occur in Saudi Arabia at the hands of the authorities.
Riyadh denies having political prisoners, but senior officials have said monitoring of activists, and potentially detaining them, is needed to maintain social stability.
As Saudi Arabia takes over the presidency of the Group of 20 countries, it is struggling to overcome intense international criticism over its human rights record, including last year's killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the arrest of women's rights activists and the devastating Yemen war.
A verdict in the trial of prominent Islamist preacher Salman al-Awdah, who was arrested more than two years ago on terrorism-related charges, was postponed on Wednesday for the fourth time, his son said on Twitter.
The public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty against Awdah, who was detained in September 2017 as a crackdown on dissent under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gathered pace. Scores of intellectuals, activists, businessmen and government officials have been arrested.
Public protests, political parties and labor unions are banned in Saudi Arabia, where the media are controlled and criticism of the royal family can lead to prison."

Violence and unrest have severely hampered efforts to contain the second worst Ebola epidemic on record, which has killed 2,199 people since the outbreak was announced in August 2018.
A local militia known as Mai Mai has repeatedly attacked health facilities because they believe Ebola does not exist, and that the response is a plot to eliminate the local population.
The Mai Mai simultaneously attacked Ebola treatment centers in Mangina in North Kivu and Byakoto in Ituri, said Jean-Jacques Muyembe, head of the Ebola response for the Democratic Republic of Congo.
""It is a blow to the Ebola response because we were eradicating the disease. These attacks are challenging the efforts to date,"" Muyembe said.
Police said the three dead were World Health Organization (WHO) workers.
New infections have been on the decline since August, with just 70 cases identified in all of October, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said on Monday.

The smaller tourist boat Mermaid, with 35 people on board, sank after being hit by the river cruiser in Budapest under a bridge during heavy rain.
Twenty five of those killed were South Koreans. The Mermaid's captain and its crew member also died. One Korean is still missing. It was the worst disaster on the Danube in more than half a century.
The smaller boat, the Mermaid, overtook the cruise ship and had the right of way as it attempted to sail under the bridge, prosecutors said. Nonetheless, the captain of the cruiser accelerated, even though the small boat was in clear view and also visible on the radar.
""The captain failed to pay sufficient attention, he did not focus on steering the ship for several minutes,"" the prosecutors said, adding that the captain failed to keep a safe distance and did not send the radio and sound signals needed when overtaking.
""(After the collision) the Mermaid got fully submerged, under water, within about 30 seconds, and sank."" 
Police have identified the captain as 64-year-old C. Yuriy from Odessa, Ukraine. His lawyers have previously said he was devastated but did nothing wrong.
The liner's owner, Swiss-based Viking Cruises Ltd [VIKI.UL], has said it was cooperating with Hungarian investigators.

Prosecutors said on Thursday that the charges against the captain, if proven guilty, could lead to two to 11 years in prison.

There were no immediate details on the maritime accord, which could further complicate disputes over energy exploration in the eastern Mediterranean where Turkish drilling has angered Greek Cypriots, Athens and the European Union.
EU foreign ministers agreed economic sanctions against Turkey two weeks ago to punish it for drilling off the coast of Cyprus in violation of a maritime economic zone established off the divided island.
The dispute pits Turkey against several eastern Mediterranean states that have agreed maritime and economic zones with Greece and Cyprus, leaving Ankara searching for allies in the region.
The new agreements were signed at a meeting in Istanbul on Wednesday between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Fayez al-Serraj, the head of the Tripoli-based government which Ankara is backing against a rival military force based in eastern Libya.
""The (security) agreement establishes training and education, structures the legal framework, and strengthens the ties between our militaries,"" the Turkish presidency's communications director Fahrettin Altun said in a tweet.
""We will also continue advocating for a political solution to build a democratic, stable and prosperous Libya,"" he said.
Altun's office said in a statement that the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on the ""delimitation of maritime jurisdictions"", which aims to protect the two countries' rights under international law.
Libya has been divided since 2014 into rival military and political camps based in the capital Tripoli and the east. Serraj's government is in conflict with forces led by Khalifa Haftar based in eastern Libya.
Haftar controls most of Libya's oil fields and facilities but oil revenues are controlled by the central bank in Tripoli. The competing military alliances are also battling on the outskirts of the capital.
In June, Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) said they had cut all ties with Turkey and that all Turkish commercial flights or ship trying to access Libya would be treated as hostile.
Diplomats say Ankara has supplied drones and trucks to Serraj, while the LNA received support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt."

(Reuters) - Beyond Hong Kong's tear gas-drenched streets and shattered universities, another battle has been raging over the city's depiction online on the crowd-sourced internet encyclopedia, Wikipedia.
As anti-government demonstrations have intensified, articles on subjects from Hong Kong's leadership to its police force have been ceaselessly rewritten for months on the website, used by millions everyday to check facts and untangle complex issues.
(Click https://tmsnrt.rs/37IPxAZ to see an interactive graphic on the Hong Kong Wiki wars.)
A Reuters analysis found a seven-fold surge in edits of the Hong Kong Police Force page over the 10 months to October, compared with a year earlier. Similar spikes occurred in articles about the protests and Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.
Changes swapped facts for insults or inserted slabs of material that upset the balance of the articles.
Where it was possible to determine the location of the editor, 40% of edits were found to have been filed from computers in Hong Kong. Internet users can disguise their location by using a virtual private network (VPN).
The number of daily edits spiked during particularly intense clashes on the territory's streets, and prompted Wiki administrators to restrict editing access to some pages, a common practice adopted with controversial issues.
Now, unregistered users and very new accounts cannot alter those articles directly, but have to make a request to submit edits.
""There has been a great increase in all types of disruptive editing including vandalism, edit wars, and extreme language from both of the major perspectives,"" said a volunteer editor with the username MarkH21, who has 13 years' experience.
""The level of disruptive editing against the government, particularly from sources in Hong Kong, is significantly higher,"" MarkH21 said. The user did not respond to requests to be identified other than by their username.
More edits eventually improve Wikipedia articles and changes can be publicly tracked to aid transparency, said Samantha Lien, a spokeswoman for Wikimedia Foundation, the not-for-profit entity that operates Wikipedia.
""Articles about contentious topics, in particular, because they are watched so regularly by editors, tend to become higher quality and more neutral,"" Lien wrote in an emailed response to a request for comment.
EDIT WARS
But not everyone is convinced.
As Wikipedia, founded in 2001, has grown in popularity and credibility, it has become a valuable but contested record of history.
""In many languages, Wikipedia is the main or sometimes only general knowledge repository online,"" said Taha Yasseri, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's Internet Institute, who has studied Wikipedia.
""Articles that are subject to edit wars can be a common place for misleading the readers,"" he said, explaining that a reader would not be aware an edit war was happening. ""At any given time, the information reflected in the article can only show some part of the truth.""
At one point in August, the police page grew by a third as long sections were added criticizing their response to demonstrators. The Oct. 1 shooting of a protester by police sparked another flurry of changes.
On the police Wiki page, the force's motto was changed from ""We Serve with Pride and Care"" to ""We Serve with Terror and Violence,"" then to ""We Shoot kids point blank"", before quickly reverting.
Lam's page received similar bursts of editing, with changes dubbing her ""Super Lady,"" and then ""Super Puppet"", after she decried a July attack on China's representative office.
Police, who have arrested more than 5,000 protesters since June, have repeatedly defended their behavior as restrained in the face of demonstrators targeting them with petrol bombs and flaming arrows.
Neither the force nor Lam's office responded to Reuters' questions about their Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia's volunteer editors, though, are bracing for more busy months.
""People naturally will advocate for anything that they strongly believe in,"" MarkH21 said.
""Thankfully, the editing community has many safeguards against it ... the self-policing mechanism of Wikipedia is that it is built around the idea of consensus."""

Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that the ambassador to Myanmar wished authorities good luck in tweets that have since been deleted ahead of the hearings next month at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
""The ambassador’s tweet was a mistake and was immediately amended,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
""Israel forthrightly condemns the atrocities perpetrated against the Rohingya in the Rakhine region. Israel voted, a week ago, in favor of a U.N. resolution condemning the atrocities.""
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since a 2017 crackdown by Myanmar's military, which U.N. investigators say was carried out with ""genocidal intent"". Buddhist majority Myanmar denies accusations of genocide.
Myanmar's de facto leader, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, will lead a delegation to defend against accusations brought at the ICJ by Gambia, which has the backing of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
Ronen Gilor, Israel's ambassador to Myanmar, had tweeted ""Encouragement for a good verdict and good luck!"" in one post, Haaretz reported with a screengrab of the since deleted tweet.
Another tweet said: ""State Counsellor going to respond for Myanmar in the ICJ! GOOD LUCK!""

Singapore's home ministry said the post on the Facebook page of a blog called the States Times Review, which contained allegations of election rigging, was ""false"" and ""scurrilous"".
It marks the second case in days under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which also allows government ministers to instruct internet firms like Facebook to correct or block access to content they deem false.
Rights groups have raised concerns the fake news law could be used to stifle free speech and chill dissent in the city state, charges government officials have denied.
""States Times Review and it's editor, who is now a citizen of Australia, will not comply with any order from a foreign government like North Korea or Singapore,"" States Times Review posted on Thursday in comments attributed to editor Alex Tan.
Earlier on Thursday, the newly-created POFMA office said Tan, a 32-year-old Singaporean, had been instructed to carry a notice on his Nov. 23 post with a link to a government statement that contained ""corrections and clarifications"" about the post.
If Tan fails to comply he could be fined of up to S$20,000, or face 12 months jail, or both, according to the law which applies to persons both in and outside the country who make false statements of fact communicated in Singapore.
The POFMA office did not immediately respond to Reuters questions on how long Tan had to comply and whether the government would instruct Facebook to take action if he didn't. Facebook declined to comment.
In the only other case under the law which came into effect in early October, political figure Brad Bowyer swiftly complied with the correction request on a post which questioned the independence of state investment firms.

The activists have been protesting for two weeks to demand that a planned reform of the election system be implemented now and not delayed until 2024. They say the delay favors the ruling Georgian Dream party.
The protesters had planned to stop lawmakers entering parliament for Thursday's session, but police erected the barriers overnight and hundreds of officers guarded the site, in the center of the capital Tbilisi.
""The government has an obligation to every citizen, and our obligation is not to give anyone the right, despite repeatedly destructive actions, to try to block the state,"" Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia told a government meeting.
The opposition said the barricades showed the government feared the demonstrators.
""What you see here is the face of the current government, a frightened government in agony,"" Zaal Udumashvili, one of the leaders of the opposition United National Movement, told Reuters, commenting on the newly erected barricades.
""The central district of Tbilisi is almost completely paralyzed and blocked by steel fences so that Ivanishvili does not hear the protest of several hundred people,"" he said.
Bidzina Ivanishivili is the leader of the ruling party leader, a former prime minister and also Georgia's richest man. His critics say he is the real ruler of the ex-Soviet republic.
Police have twice used water cannon this month to scatter the protesters outside parliament and have arrested dozens.
The protesters want to accelerate the implementation of an election system fully based on proportional representation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Conservative Party is on course to win its biggest majority in parliament since 1987 at a Dec. 12 election, according to a new poll, which would give Prime Minister Boris Johnson a mandate to take the country out of the European Union.
The model developed by pollsters YouGov that accurately predicted the 2017 election result, showed the Conservatives are set to win 359 seats out of 650, which would be their best result since Margaret Thatcher's victory in 1987.
Johnson has pledged to deliver Brexit by Jan. 31 if he wins after nearly four years of political crisis that has shocked allies of a country once considered one of the pillars of Western economic and political stability.
Since Britain voted to leave the EU in a June 2016 referendum, Johnson and his predecessor Theresa May have both tried and failed to get deals to leave the 28-member bloc through parliament because they lacked a majority.
""Our first MRP model projection for the 2019 election suggests that this time round the Conservatives are set for a majority,"" said Anthony Wells, director of political and social research at YouGov, referring to its Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification (MRP) model.
""The swing to the Conservative party is bigger in areas that voted to Leave in 2016, with the bulk of the projected Tory gains coming in the North and the urban West Midlands, as well as former mining seats in the East Midlands,"" said Wells.
The British pound, which rose when rumors of the poll results circulated, shot up when it was published, rising half a cent in minutes to hit a day's high of $1.2948.
The main opposition Labour Party is on track to secure 211 seats, down from 262, according to the YouGov model. The Scottish National Party (SNP) was on 43, the Liberal Democrats on 13 and the Brexit Party was not expected to win any seats. 
HEADING FOR BREXIT
The YouGov model crunched data from more than 100,000 interviews over seven days along with demographics, specific constituency circumstances and national statistics to come up with a projection.
It shows the election is now Johnson's to lose. 
According to the model, the Conservatives would gain 47 seats: 44 from Labour, two from the Lib Dems and the seat previously held by the Speaker of parliament. Labour are not on course to win any new seats.
""Most seats changing hands are ones that Labour won in 2017 that are now set to be taken by the Conservatives,"" YouGov said. ""What happens in these constituencies is the most important dynamic in deciding whether Boris Johnson has a majority, and how large it ends up being.""
The Brexit Party is hurting the Conservatives more than Labour, while independents are finding it difficult to pick up seats, according to the model. It showed neither Johnson nor Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab are in danger of losing their seats.
Dominic Cummings, who is Johnson's senior adviser, cautioned before the YouGov results were released that a hung parliament was still a real possibility.
""You will see many polls in the coming days. Some will say Boris will win,"" he said. ""Trust me, as someone who has worked on lots of campaigns, things are much tighter than they seem and there is a very real possibility of a hung parliament."" 
The margins of error in the model put the Conservatives seat projection between 328 and 385, YouGov said, adding that there was still plenty of time for people to change their minds before Dec. 12 - the first Christmas election in nearly a century. 
In late May 2017, just over a week before the June 8 election, YouGov's model projected Theresa May would lose her majority, even though she had been ahead in most polls.

The model, developed by Ben Lauderdale of the London School of Economics and Doug Rivers of Stanford University, was accurate: May did lose her majority, a failure that complicated Brexit and eventually destroyed her premiership.

1382,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 03:22AM ET</span>","Ahead of NATO summit, Serbia buffeted between West and Russia","By Luke Baker and Aleksandar Vasovic
LONDON/BELGRADE (Reuters) - Since October, French President Emmanuel Macron has questioned the effectiveness of NATO, hit pause on EU enlargement and called for a new 'strategic relationship' with Russia.
Plenty of countries have reason to pay close attention to his ""shake it up"" style of diplomacy, but few places will feel his words more keenly than Serbia.
For Belgrade, any pullback by Europe or NATO could allow space for Russia to fill the void, given the close political, military and economic ties Moscow has with its Balkans cousin - a fellow Slavic and Orthodox Christian state.
That is likely to be of concern for NATO leaders, who gather in Britain next week to discuss the future of their military alliance, since the Balkans, much like the Baltics, can be seen as a bulkhead against Moscow's influence.
""NATO works to promote stability, security and cooperation in the Western Balkans,"" said a NATO official. ""Any outside interference in domestic democratic processes is unacceptable. We urge Russia to do the same.""
In a recent example of alleged interference, Serbian intelligence agencies uncovered evidence of Russian spies building contacts with former members of the Serbian military. [nL8N2816NV]
Russia's foreign ministry played down the report, calling it a ""provocation"", while Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said it wouldn't harm relations between the two, adding he was sure President Vladimir Putin ""was not informed about this"".
OUT OF NATO
Alarm bells for the region rang in mid-October, when Macron refused to sign off on allowing Albania and North Macedonia, two of Serbia's neighbors, to begin talks on joining the EU.
Macron has grown increasingly wary of EU expansion, arguing that the 28-country group needs to take stock of its near doubling in size over the past 15 years, assess the impact of Britain's pending departure, and think hard about the criteria it applies to those seeking to join.
While Serbia has already begun membership talks, it now feels the chill of Macron's refusal to open the door to others on its patch.
At the same time, while nearly all surrounding countries have joined or are about to join NATO, Serbia remains out and is committed to neutrality, the memory of NATO's bombing of its territory during the 1999 Kosovo war still fresh.
It does belong to NATO's ""partnership for peace"" and takes part in NATO exercises, but its military has ties to Russia and Moscow provides technology and patronage, recently deploying its S-400 missile-defense system in Serbia for training.
Russia also regularly supplies fighter jets, surface-to-air missiles and other weaponry.
PIPELINE LEVERAGE
For the EU, much of the problem lies in what it sees as weak rule of law in Serbia, analysts said.
""What is worrying for the EU is not so much Russia but the circumstances that allow Russia to have influence - lack of the rule of law, lack of accountability, state capture, corruption,"" said Dimitar Bechev, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council and a specialist on Russian influence in the region.
""They are local phenomena, but Russia knows how to operate in such an environment and is empowered by it.""
In its latest assessment of Serbia's progress in meeting the criteria for joining the EU, Brussels flagged its concerns about corruption as well as Belgrade's failure to align with the EU on restrictive measures imposed on Russia.
While Moscow does not have the money to match either China or the European Union for spending and investment in the region, it still has considerable leverage.
Turkstream, a pipeline to supply Russian gas to Europe while bypassing Ukraine, is set to run via Bulgaria and Serbia before arriving in Hungary and supplying Germany, Austria and others.
That makes Serbia a critical link in the EU's energy pipeline, similar to the role Ukraine played as gas transshipper to the EU before falling foul of Moscow.
Milan Karagaca, a former military diplomat and a member of Belgrade's Centre for Foreign Policy think-tank, doesn't think Russia has grand plans to exploit Serbia strategically, but sees it ""as a pawn in its great game with the West"".
Serbia's task is to remain on good terms with Moscow, convince Brussels it is doing what's required to become an EU member state and avoid alienating NATO.
A government official, who declined to be named, said Serbia intended to maintain a balance between Russia and the West.
""No country or international body can claim they have us within their sphere of influence,"" he said. 
Whatever the outcome, Serbia risks ending up being a small piece in a larger game of geopolitics that has sped up since Macron took NATO to task and questioned Europe's capabilities.
""If the West is disengaged and lets the region go then Russia has lots of opportunities to get mileage out of the situation,"" said Bechev.
On the other hand, if Serbia does join the EU, Bechev says it could become akin to Cyprus or Hungary, two member states with close ties to Moscow. 

""Serbia will be weak or pro-Russian if they end up in the EU, which is no bad outcome for Russia either,"" he said.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 03:13AM ET</span>",Pakistan's top court to rule on controversial extension for army chief,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's top court will rule on Thursday whether to grant an extension to the country's army chief, in a rare case that pits the judiciary against the government and the military.
The cabinet of prime minister Imran Khan approved a three-year extension for General Qamar Javed Bajwa in August, citing a worsening national security situation in the region over its rivalry with India.
But in a surprise ruling on Tuesday, the Supreme Court suspended the extension, citing a series of irregularities and ordering the government and the army to produce legal provisions and detailed arguments on the reasoning behind the move.
On Thursday the court reserved judgment, to be passed later in the day. It said a ruling would be pronounced after the government agrees to pass a law to lay down terms and conditions of the new appointment.
Bajwa's term is due to expire at midnight on Thursday.
""You will pass a law from parliament in six months,"" Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa told the court, adding that the court would reach a verdict later in the day.
Irrespective of the decision, the episode could weaken the authority of the government, led by Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. The civilian government has enjoyed good relations with the armed forces, in contrast to the previous government of Khan's main rival Nawaz Sharif.
It has also led to questions about the future of Bajwa, who has led the military through a period of escalating tensions with India and western neighbor Afghanistan.
The abrupt decision of the court to suspend Bajwa's extension, and the government's reaction, has been branded ""a comedy of errors"" by Pakistan's media, which is rarely critical of the military.
""This is without a doubt the most shambolic episode in the PTI government's tenure so far,"" said an editorial in Dawn, the country's leading English-language newspaper on Thursday.
""Surely there are other officers more than capable of leading the army. General Bajwa's next step will determine whether he is thinking of himself or his institution.""
During Bajwa's tenure, the military has been accused by opposition politicians of electoral manipulation, meddling in politics, suspension of civil liberties and muzzling the media to help Khan win power last year. The military has always denied interfering in politics.
The army chief usually serves a three-year term. Since the role was established in 1972, only one general has had his term extended by a civilian government.
Pakistan's powerful military has ruled the country for more than half of its 72-year history, and sets defense and security policy."

In December 2017, Ivana Smit, 18, was found dead on the balcony of a condominium on the sixth floor of a high-rise residential complex in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur.
She was believed to have fallen to her death from a 20th-floor unit occupied by an American-Khazakhstani couple with whom she had spent the night.
A court inquest concluded in March that Smit's death was a ""misadventure,"" and that no one was responsible for her death despite evidence of bruises and trauma on her body and DNA traces of the American under her fingernails, according to media reports.
However, a high court last week granted an application by Smit's family to set aside the inquest's findings, ruling that her death was possibly caused by someone else, said police criminal investigation department chief Huzir Mohamed.
""The court ordered the attorney general to instruct the police to reinvestigate the cause of death, and for the case to be reclassified under Section 302 (of the Penal Code),"" Huzir said at a press conference broadcast on the police's official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, referring to Malaysia's laws regarding murder.
Huzir said a team will be formed to reinvestigate the case pending instructions from the attorney general, after which they will record witness statements.
He did not specify who or how many witnesses the police would question.
It is not known whether the couple who hosted her is still in Malaysia.
Police originally had classified the case as ""sudden death."""

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 01:42AM ET</span>","China holds out carrot ahead of Taiwan election, but few convinced","By Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - China is stepping up efforts to be nice to Taiwan ahead of key elections on Jan. 11, offering better treatment to Taiwanese in China and urging the democratic island to ""come home"", but many there only see Beijing wielding a threatening stick.
China denies interfering in elections in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as sacred territory, but it traditionally tries various means to influence their result, hoping politicians with a more positive view on China ties get into office.
These can range from military intimidation - China fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait before the 1996 election - to what Taiwan's government calls Beijing's manipulation of China-friendly Taiwanese media.
China also wants to ensure that Taiwan's huge business community in China is happy, hoping they will go home to vote for China-friendly politicians.
This month, China unveiled 26 measures to further open its economy to investors from Taiwan, and said Taiwanese abroad could turn to Chinese embassies for consular help.
Dovetailing with those steps has been an unusual Chinese effort at soft power to speak directly to people in Taiwan, a gentler approach after some hostile moves this year, such as a threat of force by President Xi Jinping in January.
Commenting on the 26 measures, Hai Xia, one of the highest-profile news presenters on Chinese state television, appealed for Taiwan to return ""home"".
""Taiwan's fate is connected with the motherland. Wan Wan, come home,"" she said on air, employing a diminutive to refer to Taiwan and project a friendly message.
China has not only been using Mandarin, the official tongue on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, but has also deployed Hokkien and Hakka, two languages spoken on the island but whose formal use is not encouraged in China.
On Wednesday, it introduced Zhu Fenglian, a new spokeswoman for its policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, who voiced warm greetings in both languages at her first news conference. 
""I am a Hakka from Guangdong, I'd like first here to say hello to folks in Taiwan,"" she said, referring to the southern Chinese province while speaking in Hokkien, generally known in Taiwan as Taiwanese. 
Many politicians in Taiwan, a rambunctious democracy, have responded vigorously to China's gestures.
Beijing should focus on ""giving its own people a bit more freedom"", Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Twitter in response to China's 26 measures, writing in the simplified Chinese characters used in China and not Taiwan. 
The Chinese state television comment on ""coming home"" also triggered a backlash.
""Thank you for your concern; the people of Taiwan are already in their own home,"" legislator Hung Tzu-yung, of the New Power Party, wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
China was the ""enemy of democracy"", Cho Jung-tai, chairman of the ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), which has repeatedly warned of the threat China poses, said this week. 
Even Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which favors closer ties, has been cautious of being too closely associated with Beijing in an election year.
Commenting on the new measures for Taiwanese in China, the Kuomintang welcomed their beneficial content. 
""But if any of these actions belittle the sovereignty of the Republic of China, it must be firmly opposed,"" it warned, using Taiwan's official name.

""The Kuomintang hopes both sides of the Taiwan Strait will give priority to each other's livelihoods and not hurt the rights and interests of the people on both sides for momentary election considerations.""

On 28 November 1979, Air New Zealand flight 901 was on a sightseeing tour from Auckland when it crashed into the side of Mount Erebus, a 3,794 meter (12,448 ft) volcano near the U.S. Antarctic research base of McMurdo Station.
Most of the 237 passengers and 20 crew killed were New Zealanders but other nationalities included Americans, Canadians, Japanese and Australians.
Originally the crash was blamed on the pilots, but following a public outcry, a Royal Commission of Inquiry was set up to investigate the disaster. It concluded the main cause of the accident was the state-owned airline’s actions in reprogramming the aircraft’s navigation system without advising the aircrew.
The Commission head, former justice Peter Mahon, controversially also said witnesses from Air New Zealand had conspired to give false evidence, famously describing the airline's defense as ""an orchestrated litany of lies"".  
This led to his report being criticized by both Air New Zealand and the government. 
The actions of the then government and the airline caused more pain and grief to the victims' families, Prime Minister Ardern said at a memorial service at the Government House in Auckland on Thursday.
""After forty years, on behalf of today’s government, the time has come to apologize for the actions of an airline then in full state ownership; which ultimately caused the loss of the aircraft and the loss of those you loved,"" Ardern said in her speech.
""The pilots were not responsible for this tragedy, and I stand here today to state that again,"" she added.
Ardern acknowledged the findings of the Royal Commission were not accepted by the government of the day, and it was only nearly 20 years later the report was even presented in parliament.
In 2009, Air New Zealand apologized to the families of the victims for mistakes made by the airline in the aftermath of the crash, and on Thursday Air New Zealand Chairman Therese Walsh also expressed regret.
""I apologize on behalf of an airline which 40 years ago failed in its duty of care to its passengers and staff,"" said Walsh."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Two winter storms blasted the United States on Wednesday, stranding motorists and causing thousands of flight delays as Americans jammed highways and airports to visit family and friends for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Scores of vehicles got stuck on Interstate 5 after a ""bomb cyclone"" - a supercharged winter storm caused by a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure - dumped up to four feet (1.2 meters) of snow in mountainous areas of the Pacific Northwest.
""We've been white knuckling it for the last four hours and sliding around the road,"" said Lisa Chadwick after she stopped in Bend, Oregon, driving north from San Francisco. She had snowchains for her two-wheel drive car, but did not know how to put them on.
The U.S. Midwest was also hit hard by a storm that clobbered Denver on Tuesday, with airports in Minneapolis and Chicago suffering hundreds of delays and cancellations.
The storms hit on one of the busiest travel days of the year, with a near-record 55 million Americans set to journey at least 50 miles (80 km) for Thanksgiving on Thursday, according to the American Automobile Association.
After parts of Colorado got up to 30 inches (75 cm) of snow on Tuesday, Minneapolis was expected to get as much as 12 inches as the system slid east, said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.
The storm, which is packing high winds, will move across upper Michigan and upstate New York toward central Maine, which could get 6 to 10 inches of snow, the Weather Service forecast.
""LOTS OF HONKING""
On the West Coast, heavy rain threatened flash floods from San Diego to Los Angeles.
Los Angeles International Airport told domestic passengers to arrive three hours early as it expected 238,000 passengers and 113,000 vehicles on Wednesday.
""There has been definitely lots of honking, lots of near accidents that I've seen, for sure,"" Daniel Julien, a 24-year-old paralegal from Pasadena, said after making it to the airport.
A silver lining was that rain doused the Cave Fire in Santa Barbara County, which charred 7 square miles (1,810 hectares) of brush and woodlands. But it brought evacuation warnings to thousands of residents in Santa Barbara suburbs for possible mudslides on fire-charred hills.
Across the country, 4,083 flights were delayed, and 148 were canceled into or out of the United States by 6.30 p.m. ET, with Chicago's O'Hare International Airport tallying the most, according to FlightAware.com.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian cosmetics company Natura Cosmeticos SA said on Wednesday that it was concerned about a state police raid against a nongovernment organization (NGO) that it has partnered with on sustainably developing the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest region.
On Tuesday, police in the northern Amazon rainforest state of Para raided the Health and Happiness Project, as part of a probe into the causes of a recent rash of forest fires in the region. Police also arrested four volunteer fireman working for a separate NGO on accusations of purposefully setting the fires in an effort to boost donations.
The arrests triggered an uproar from politicians and NGOs who condemned it as a move to unjustly persecute environmental groups.
Natura, which makes many products using natural additives from the Amazon, said the Health and Happiness Project was part of a partnership it formed last year involving several organizations to provide ingredients. In a statement on social media, Natura only addressed the Health and Happiness Project raid and did not mention the firefighters.
""Natura expresses solidarity with the Health and Happiness Project,"" the statement said.
""Regarding the operation against the NGO, Natura is concerned by the means employed to address an issue as sensitive as the future of the Amazon.""
Health and Happiness works closely with fire prevention efforts in the same region as the Alter do Chao Fire Brigade, whose members were arrested.
On Wednesday, a judge denied the release of the four firefighters, ruling that they could remain jailed for 10 days as a preventive measure as police continue to carry out their investigation, according to Michell Durans, a lawyer representing the firefighters.
Durans said in a phone interview they would appeal the decision and that he expected an injunction against the arrests to be ruled on by Friday.
Brazilian right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has been fiercely critical of NGOs, saying they act on behalf of foreign interests to undermine the country's sovereignty. As forest fires in Brazil's Amazon surged to their highest point since 2010 in August, Bolsonaro suggested that NGOs were to blame for setting the blazes.
Greenpeace and other groups claim that the raid was part of a larger campaign to criminalize NGOs and social movements.
""It's a decision I see as nothing more than an attempt to realize the anti-democratic political discourse that has been promised in Brazil,"" Durans said of the arrests."

Australian media reports said the defector, named Wang Liqiang, has provided Australian intelligence with details about Chinese political interference in Hong Kong and Australia, and Beijing's plans to disrupt presidential elections in the self-ruled island of Taiwan next year.
Chinese police, however, claimed Wang was an unemployed man from the southeastern province of Fujian who had been found guilty of fraud in 2016. He was also carrying a forged passport and Hong Kong resident document, they said.
The Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party, released the footage on its Weibo account late on Wednesday and said Wang had become ""a new tool for the West to smear China"".
The footage, said to be from October 2016, shows a man identified as Wang Liqiang confessing to fraud and asking the court for leniency, saying he had ""weak legal awareness"".
The Global Times said on Thursday Wang had continued his ""fraudulent activities"" overseas, ""making up a series of fake stories that throw shade at China backed by Western media speculation"".

The Bureau of Meteorology warned the country could expect more heatwaves and little rain in the east during the summer, which runs from December through February, following one of the driest springs ever.
""We've already seen significant bushfire activity during spring, and the outlook for drier and warmer than average conditions will maintain that heightened risk over the coming months,"" the bureau's head of long-range forecasts, Andrew Watkins, said in a statement.
The hot, dry spring led to an early start to Australia's bushfire season, with people killed and more than 500 homes destroyed since September. Fire authorities have warned there is worse to come.
The forecast offered no relief to Australia's devastated farming sector, with the country's largest and most lucrative crop, wheat, facing the worst damage in the third straight year of drought.
Temperatures across most of the country are highly likely to be warmer than average during the day and night, the bureau said.
""This outlook also means the risk of heatwaves is increased,"" Watkins said.
Australia's shaky power grid has suffered blackouts over the past two summers as ageing coal-fired plants crashed in the heat, just as power demand for airconditioners soared.
The dry spring and weak outlook for summer rains in the east were due mainly to warmer than average waters in the Indian Ocean off Africa, combined with cooler than normal waters off Indonesia.
""The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record,"" Watkins said.
That would also delay the onset of the monsoon rains in tropical northern Australia to mid-summer.
However coastal areas of Western Australia were showing increased odds of wetter than average conditions, the bureau said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy announced on Wednesday it would scrap plans to carry out reviews of three Navy SEALs that could have led to their ouster from the elite force, after President Donald Trump's extraordinary intervention in a related case.
""I have determined that any failures in conduct, performance, judgment, or professionalism exhibited by these officers be addressed through other administrative measures as appropriate,"" acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said in a statement.
The decision follows Trump's order on Sunday that Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher keep his status as a Navy SEAL, even after he was convicted of battlefield misconduct. The review of the three other SEALs was connected to the Gallagher case.
Critics say the actions undermine military justice and send a message that battlefield atrocities will be tolerated. Trump's former Navy secretary, Richard Spencer, who was fired on Sunday over the case, has spoken out against the president on the issue.
""The president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices,"" Spencer wrote in a piece published by the Washington Post on Wednesday.
Trump has argued that Gallagher's case was mishandled by the Navy and said that he is defending America's warfighters from unfair and unfounded prosecution.
The now-terminated reviews of the three remaining SEALs -- Lieutenant Jacob Portier, Lieutenant Commander Robert Breisch and Lieutenant Thomas MacNeil -- had received far less attention than the Gallagher case.
A military jury in July convicted Gallagher of illegally posing for pictures with the corpse of an Islamic State fighter while deployed to Iraq in 2017, but acquitted him of murder in the detainee's death. Gallagher also was cleared of charges of attempted murder in the wounding of two civilians, a schoolgirl and an elderly man, shot from a sniper's perch.
Portier, Breisch and MacNeil were under scrutiny in the Gallagher affair as his superiors.
Modly said his decision to scrap the reviews should not be interpreted as a diminishment of the SEAL ethos, which he quoted. It says the elite fighters serve with honor ""on and off the battlefield.""

""The United States Navy, and the Naval Special Warfare Community specifically, have dangerous and important work to do,"" he said in his statement. ""In my judgment, neither deserves the continued distraction and negative attention that recent events have evoked.""

(Reuters) - The message appeared on my cellphone with an intriguing opening line: “I am sure you won’t remember hearing my real name, Nguyen thi Phuong Mai...”
By the end of the message, I remembered everything.
The young woman writing me had just watched a YouTube video of me talking about a documentary I produced seven years ago on Operation Babylift, the mass evacuation in 1975 of 3,000 Vietnamese children from Saigon to Western countries for adoption. I had interviewed a woman named Nguyen thi Dep in Vietnam, who gave up her 3-year-old child Mai for the chance at a better life. Dep told me she had been desperately searching for her daughter for years.
Now living in the United States and named Leigh Small by her adoptive parents, she had just discovered, partly through Ancestry.com, that Dep was her birth mother. She had stumbled across my video online and watched in shock as Dep explained to me why she let Mai go.
“Her eyes were just sad and that hurt me,” Leigh, 47, later told me. “I never thought about the worry that she went through, not knowing. I think I just assumed she knew I fell into a great family and I had a great life, but how would she know that?”
I am also an Operation Babylift adoptee, only I ended up in Australia. And I also found my Vietnamese mother, who thought I was dead until I showed up at her local police station, 28 years after she left me at a World Vision orphanage.
Leigh and I are members of a small, unique club and our shared experiences, though on opposite sides of the world, created an instant bond between us. When I asked Leigh if I could cover her reunion with Dep in Vietnam for Reuters, she initially hesitated. Leigh confided that she was camera shy and felt the meeting should be private. But she wanted to educate others about Operation Babylift and eventually, Leigh said she believed I would be fair and accurate, because I had been on the same journey.

Six weeks later, in Ho Chi Minh City, Leigh embraced her birth mother. I was humbled that they trusted me to witness the moment and share it with the world. [nL4N27S065]

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria met with its West African neighbors on Tuesday over its land border closure, with the African giant insisting on levying duties on goods transiting to its country through neighboring nations to curb smuggling.
""Tuesday, there was a meeting between ... the comptrollers of customs of all the three countries involved. We have not reached any agreement ... but our insistence is that we must all respect the ECOWAS protocol on transit goods,"" Information Minister Lai Mohammed told reporters in Abuja.
Mohammed said the protocol on duty payment for transit goods has not been followed to the detriment of local manufacturers.
He said the government was putting in place checks to ensure that Nigeria's economy will not be overrun as a result of a free trade agreement it signed this year. Nigeria plans to keep its land borders closed until at least January.
In July, Nigeria signed up to an African Continental Free Trade Area, a project to create a $3.4 trillion economic bloc, despite fears that Nigeria could be flooded with cheap goods from competitive neighbors.
Since taking office in 2015, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has introduced policies aimed at curbing imports and smuggling, to boost local manufacturing. Buhari has also been trying to boost revenues after a 2016 recession slashed income.
""We cannot continue to subsidize the rest of West Africa,"" Mohammed said, adding that Nigeria has been able to save around 30% from its fuel consumption as a result of the border closure.
Some 10-20% of Nigerian fuel is smuggled to neighboring countries as gasoline is heavily subsidized in the country and prices are higher in neighboring countries.
Mohammed said import duty collection has grown by 15% since the closure, three months ago, noting that the number of weapons smuggled into the country has also reduced.
Nigeria, Benin and Niger agreed this month to set up a joint border patrol force to tackle smuggling. The countries planned to hold their first meeting in Abuja this week.
Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele on Tuesday said he would advise the Nigerian government to maintain the border closure in the interests of boosting economic output, which has been recovering relatively slowly in the non-oil sector.
Emefiele said the impact of the closures on prices was ""reactionary and temporary"" and that the medium-term benefits of the government's decision outweighed the short-term costs, after inflation soared to a 17-month high last month."

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 03:41PM ET</span>","William Ruckelshaus, who resigned in Watergate's 'Saturday Night Massacre,' dies at 87: U.S. media","(Reuters) - William Ruckelshaus, picked by Richard Nixon as the first head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and as deputy attorney general before being fired for defying the president in the Watergate scandal, died on Wednesday at the age of 87, U.S. media reported.
Ruckelshaus, a moderate Republican highly regarded for his integrity and seen as a white knight by the environmental community, died at his home in Seattle, according to the New York Times, citing his daughter Mary Ruckelshaus.
In what was known as the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" in October 1973, Ruckelshaus, then deputy attorney general, and his boss, Attorney General Elliot Richardson, resigned rather than carry out Nixon's order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was pursuing recordings of conversations that eventually brought down Nixon's presidency.
Cox was fired by the solicitor general, Robert Bork, igniting an outcry over the Watergate scandal that eventually forced Nixon to resign in August 1974 rather than face removal from office by Congress.
""When you accept a presidential appointment, you must remind yourself there are lines over which you will not step — lines impossible to define in advance but nevertheless always present,"" Ruckelshaus said in a 2012 speech in Seattle. ""In this case, the line was bright and the decision was simple.""
Ruckelshaus was the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, created in 1970. He later noted that 16 major pieces of environmental legislation were enacted during Nixon's years in office, when visibly filthy air and water forced action.
""Citizens were demanding something be done and government was responding,"" he said.
The White House shifted Ruckelshaus in 1973 to acting director of the FBI and then deputy attorney general, plugging gaps as the Watergate scandal engulfed the Nixon administration.
Ruckelshaus returned to private law practice after leaving the Justice Department but in 1983 the Reagan administration brought him back to run the embattled EPA after the then administrator Anne Gorsuch and a number of her top aides resigned amid allegations of mismanagement and conflicts of interest.
Ruckelshaus was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President Barack Obama in 2015. Obama said Ruckelshaus ""spent his life putting country before party or politics. He reminds us how noble public service can be. And our air and water is cleaner and our lives are brighter because of him.""
DOWNTRODDEN AGENCY
President Ronald Reagan - whose pro-business, anti-regulation administration was a bane of environmentalists - praised Ruckelshaus as ""Mr. Clean"" and said he would ""mark a new beginning"" at the downtrodden agency.
But the White House cut Ruckelshaus' requests for more money for the agency, and sided with industry against his efforts for stronger enforcement of the Superfund law to clean up toxic waste dumps, tighter controls on pollution causing acid rain and other regulations business and industry opposed.
He resigned from the agency in 1985.
In an essay in 1995 on the EPA's 25th anniversary, Ruckelshaus talked about the periodic beating the agency takes, with repeated attacks on its very existence.
""The anti-environmental push of the '90s is prompted by the pro-environmental excess of the late '80s, which was prompted by the anti-environmental excess of the early eighties, which was prompted by the pro-environmental excess of the '70s,"" he wrote.
Ruckelshaus, who lived in Seattle, stayed active on a number of boards and commissions, including the William D. Ruckelshaus Center at the University of Washington.
He served as chairman of the board of the World Resources Institute, special envoy to the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the United States and Canada and on the President's Council for Sustainable Development.
William Doyle Ruckelshaus was born July 24, 1932 in Indianapolis, Indiana, and earned his undergraduate degree at Princeton University and his law degree at Harvard.
He practiced law in Indianapolis with the firm his family founded in 1895, then became Indiana's deputy attorney general. He was elected to the state's House of Representatives, where he was majority leader from 1967 to 1969. In 1968 he was the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate but lost to Democrat Birch Bayh.
Nixon tapped him in 1969 as assistant attorney general in charge of the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Division, before putting him in charge of the EPA.
Ruckelshaus' wife, Jill, a director of Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), was the White House special assistant on women's rights in the Nixon administration but gave up the job after he resigned rather than carry out Nixon's order in the Watergate scandal."

GENEVA (Reuters) - The exiled leader of China's minority Muslim Uighurs is pressing countries to cut trade links with Beijing, saying the time for business as usual is over.
Dolkun Isa, president of the Munich-based group the World Uighur Congress, was speaking after two leaked troves of classified Chinese government documents provided evidence of mass detention camps for Uighurs in its western Xinjiang region.
Beijing denies any mistreatment of the Uighurs or others in Xinjiang, saying it is providing vocational training to help stamp out militancy and separatism and teach new skills. 
Isa is due to meet Swiss Foreign Ministry officials on Thursday to lobby the neutral country, which has a free trade agreement with China, where major Swiss banks and companies are active.
""These documents were leaked, there is no longer any excuse for silence. The documents show everything very clearly. The documents bring more international attention, more international pressure to the Chinese government,"" Isa told Reuters on Wednesday.
""It is not time for business as usual,"" he said. ""So that's why we express to the Swiss government to stop free trade cooperation with China and also it is not the right time that Swiss companies continue their business with China.""
U.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in Xinjiang in a crackdown begun in 2017 that has been condemned by the United States and other countries.
Isa said some camps had expanded and may hold 3 million people in all. German scholar Adrien Zenz this week put the figure interned so far at up to 1.8 million.
The New York Times published the details of the first set of leaked Chinese government documents on the details its clampdown on Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.
The government of Xinjiang condemned the 403 pages of documents as ""fabricated"" and prompted by ""hostile foreign forces"". 
The second leak of documents, published last Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, describe the inner workings of detention camps. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday the leaked documents confirmed China was committing ""very significant"" human rights abuses against Uighurs and other minorities.
Isa and fellow Uighurs have lobbied governments in Europe, Asia and North America for support. 

""These countries should be changing their mind. Because all the time they have been asking for evidence. We knew what was going on for the Uighurs but it is difficult for us to bring some evidence,"" he said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The international police organization Interpol put off plans to condemn the spread of strong encryption after objections by tech companies and civil liberties advocates, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Interpol's group on crimes against children had discussed a resolution on the topic put forward by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation at the group's conference in Lyon two weeks ago.
At the close of the conference, leaders told attendees they would release a statement calling on tech companies to design products that allow governments to ""obtain access to data in a readable and useable format,"" Reuters reported on Nov. 17.
A resolution draft seen by Reuters echoed recent statements by law enforcement in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia that blamed end-to-end encryption for permitting sex crimes against children to go undetected.
Such encryption generally cannot be broken without access to one of the devices participating in the interaction, though many services do track who was communicating with whom and keep other information helpful to law enforcement.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) in particular has come under fire this year after announcing plans to fully encrypt its Messenger chats by default, as texts already are on Facebook's WhatsApp service.
After the Reuters article appeared, Facebook and others complained that strong encryption also deters criminal hacking and surveillance of peaceful political activists by repressive regimes, the people said.
Conference organizers told some who had attended that they were surprised by the feedback and delayed putting out a statement while they reconsidered, those people said.
Interpol's press office, meanwhile, said that the organization's top leadership had not planned to issue anything. Neither Interpol nor its leadership on crimes against children responded to requests for additional comment."

KABUL (Reuters) - The top U.S. general said on Wednesday that the chances of a successful outcome from peace talks on ending the 18-year war in Afghanistan were higher than before and could happen in the ""near term.""
Earlier this month the Afghan Taliban released American and Australian university professors held hostage for more than three years, raising hopes for a revival of peace talks.
The chances of successful peace talks are complicated by the Taliban's refusal to engage with what they call an ""illegitimate"" U.S.-backed government in Kabul.
A messy political situation in Afghanistan and continued violence only make the situation more difficult.
Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived in Afghanistan on Wednesday, his first trip to the country since taking the top job in September.
""I think the chances of a positive outcome through negotiations is higher than I have seen, and I've been deeply involved in Afghanistan for 18 years,"" Milley told reporters.
""With a bit of luck, we'll have successful negotiations in the near term, not too distant future,"" Milley said.
He added that work remained to actually see a positive outcome.
""A lot of time in situations like this, two steps forward one step back,"" he said.
Over the past 18 years, senior American military leaders and diplomats have routinely talked about their optimism and how the war has turned a corner, but the Taliban continue to control large parts of the country.
Talks between the Taliban and the United States aimed at ending the war collapsed in September after President Donald Trump called off what he described as a planned meeting at the U.S. Camp David presidential retreat.
Before the talks were broken off, both sides had said they were close to a deal.
Two Taliban leaders told Reuters that the group had again been holding meetings with senior U.S. officials in Doha since this weekend, saying they could soon resume the peace process.
""Our leaders started unofficial meetings with senior U.S. officials in Doha and working on a plan how to resume the peace process,"" one of the Taliban leaders said.
Milley said negotiations were ""ongoing.""
Last month the U.S. military said that it had quietly reduced the number of troops by about 2,000, to bring the total number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to between 12,000 and 13,000.
The Pentagon has said it can go down to 8,600 troops and still carry out a counter-terrorism mission.
Milley said no decisions had been made on troop reductions and there were several options, including going down to 8,600."

BELFAST (Reuters) - A fresh drive to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland will be launched immediately after the UK General Election, it was announced on Wednesday.
Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said he had set December 16 for the start of a new round of inter-party talks whatever the result of the election.
The British-run province has been without a devolved executive for almost three years since it collapsed amid a row over a botched renewable heating scheme.
Speaking at the launch of the Conservative Northern Ireland manifesto, where Boris Johnson's Conservative party have four candidates running, he said with a bit of Christmas spirit a deal can be reached before the festivities.
The current deadline to  restore the power sharing administration is January 13, 2020 and, if that is not met, the government is legally required to call another assembly election. 
The deadline has twice been extended since Stormont collapsed in January 2017. But Mr Smith said he did not see ""any appetite"" at Westminster for a further extension.
Smith said there was a deal ""raring to go"" but it required political will among the local parties.
He said each party had ""made a commitment to getting back into talks. We can't let this run and run, we have got to get this sorted. The number of issues is relatively small"".
The main Northern Irish parties, the Democratic Unionists and nationalist Sinn Fein, said they were ready to attend despite no apparent change in their positions that have prevented the re-establishment of a local administration for over 1,000 days.
Sinn Fein's leader in Northern Ireland, party Vice President Michelle O'Neill, said ""any restoration must ensure the Assembly is sustainable, credible and has the confidence of the public. The key to any agreement is resolving the outstanding issues which lie at the heart  of the talks"".
The DUP's Gavin Robinson, who is fighting to retain his Westminster seat in East Belfast, said O'Neill should ""lead her team back into the Assembly where decisions can be made"", rather than ""taking selfies on picket lines"" outside hospitals where staff are engaged in industrial action.
""A restored Assembly could deliver a pay increase for hardworking staff in our hospitals,"" he said and a health minister could address the shortages of doctors and nurses."

ATHENS (Reuters) - Clothes should be cherished, re-worn and even passed on to the next generation, Anna Wintour, the influential editor of Vogue magazine said, calling for more sustainability in the fashion world and less of a throwaway culture.
In an interview with Reuters, Wintour, considered one of the most powerful people in fashion, also said the industry was ""a little bit late in the game"" in pursuing diversity and inclusivity and that, despite the meteoric rise of social media influencers, Vogue would remain a benchmark for fashionistas.
Many brands are trying to bolster their green credentials and entice young environmentally-savvy consumers as the sector comes under scrutiny for fuelling a throwaway culture.
But in good news for second-hand bargain hunters, Wintour, who has been at the helm of American Vogue for more than 30 years, said fashionistas should care for their clothes and even pass them on.
""I think for all of us it means an attention more on craft, on creativity, and less on the idea of clothes that are instantly disposable, things that you will throw away just after one reading,"" she said.
""(It's all about) talking to our audiences, our readers, about keeping the clothes that you own, and valuing the clothes that you own and wearing them again and again, and maybe giving them on to your daughter, or son, whatever the case may be.""
A 2016 report by management consultancy McKinsey & Company said global clothing output doubled between 2000 and 2014, with the number of garments bought each year per person surging 60 percent.
DIVERSITY ON THE RUNWAY
Instantly recognizable with her short fringed bob haircut and sunglasses, British-born Wintour has long been a front row staple at catwalk shows.
The 2006 movie ""The Devil Wears Prada"" starring Meryl Streep as a no-nonsense editor of the fictional Runway fashion magazine is widely believed to be based on her.
Thanks in part to social media, who and what should be in fashion had radically changed in the past decade, Wintour said.
Fashion weeks across the globe, where designers present their latest creations, are seeing a more diverse mix of people, though Wintour said the industry had been slow on the uptake. 
""We are seeing a far more diverse and inclusive representation on the runway, on our social media channels and also in the pages of our different magazines,"" she said.
""I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we have so many designers of color in the United States. Until there is truly a voice at the table things will not change the way that they should. I feel we have long way to go."" 
Wintour, who is also artistic director at parent company Conde Nast, was speaking to Reuters in Athens on the sidelines of the Vogue Greece 'ChangeMakers' event on Wednesday. 
Vogue Greece hit the newsstands earlier this year following a seven-year absence as publishers bet the county's economic recovery after a debt crisis will revive an appetite for glossy fashion and lifestyle prints.
Asked about the growing influencers' effect, Wintour said they had ""fun and varied"" views but could never match the reach of Vogue. 
""Globally Vogue has 127 million followers ... I think that Vogue is the biggest influencer of them all on a global scale.""

As the conflicts between the foreign-backed Afghan government forces and Taliban insurgents has dragged on for more than 18 years, civilians usually bear the brunt of war with record numbers of casualties.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Forty-seven Nigerian men pleaded innocent on Wednesday to a charge of public displays of affection with members of the same sex, an offence that carries a 10-year jail term. 
Homosexuality is outlawed in many socially conservative African societies where some religious groups brand it a corrupting Western import. 
The Nigerian men, who appeared at a court in the commercial capital Lagos, were among 57 arrested in a police raid on a hotel in the impoverished Egbeda district of the city in 2018.
Police said they were being ""initiated"" into a gay club, but the accused said they were attending a birthday party. 
The trial is a test case for a law banning gay marriage, punishable by a 14-year jail term, and same-sex ""amorous relationships"". It caused international outcry when it came into force under former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014. 
Nobody has yet been convicted under the law, prosecution and defense lawyers in the case told Reuters. But Human Rights Watch and other activists say it has been used to extort bribes from suspects in exchange for not pursuing charges.
""Police officers will stop you and then get you arrested, extort money from you and begin to call you names,"" Smart Joel, one of the defendants, told Reuters before the hearing. ""I just wish the case will be quickly dismissed as soon as possible,"" added Joel, 25, who runs a laundry and dry cleaning business. 
Spokesmen for Nigeria's police and ministry of justice did not respond to text messages and phone calls seeking comment on the extortion allegations. 
Activists working to protect rights of sexual minorities in Nigeria said they were tired of harassment.
""The vagueness of the law makes it impossible to get a conviction,"" Xeenarh Mohammed, executive director of the Lagos-based Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERS), told Reuters. ""What does 'amorous showing of same-sex affection' mean?"" she added.
The case was adjourned until Dec. 11. 
The judge granted each of the men bail, provided they can post 500,000 naira ($1,634.52) and provide a surety who is either a civil servant or resides in Lagos state and has a ""reasonable"" income. 
Prosecutors told Reuters police would track down the other 10 men out of the 57 originally arrested who failed to appear in court.

MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Wednesday Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) did not ""give a damn"" about its pain, after the U.S. tech giant began referring to the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula as part of Russia in its Maps and Weather apps for Russian users.
Russia and Ukraine have both been highly sensitive to the way global companies identify Crimea, since Russian troops seized the territory and Moscow annexed it after a referendum that Kiev and its Western allies say was illegal.
Apple appeared to have changed the way it displays locations in Crimea in its software, in a nod to Russian politicians who have demanded the peninsula be referred to as part of Russia. 
Reuters reporters in Moscow who typed the name of the Crimean provincial capital Simferopol into Apple's Maps and Weather apps on Wednesday saw it displayed as ""Simferopol, Crimea, Russia"". Users elsewhere -- including in Ukraine's capital Kiev and in Crimea itself -- see locations in Crimea displayed without specifying which country they belong to.
""Let me explain in your terms, Apple,"" Ukraine's foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, wrote on Twitter in English. ""Imagine you're crying out that your design and ideas, years of work and piece of your heart are stolen by your worst enemy, but then somebody ignorant doesn't give a damn about your pain. 
""That's how it feels when you call Crimea a Russian land.""
Apple's Russia division did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The EU and United States do not recognise Crimea as Russian and have imposed sanctions against the peninsula and individuals they accuse of violating Ukraine's territorial integrity. 
Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, reported on Wednesday that the head of the committee on security and anti-corruption, Vasily Piskaryov, had held a meeting with an Apple representative. 

According to a report on the State Duma website, Piskaryov said: ""Apple has fulfilled its obligations and brought the programmes on its devices in line with the requirements of Russian law.""

(Reuters) - The Canadian province of British Columbia's legislature unanimously has approved a bill to implement a U.N. agreement on the rights of indigenous peoples which would formally allow them a say in matters affecting their rights.
The bill, approved late on Tuesday, provides a legal framework for governments' relationship with indigenous residents.
""This legislation advances a path forward to true reconciliation,"" Scott Fraser, B.C.'s minister of indigenous relations, said in a joint statement with the leaders of the indigenous groups who helped write the legislation - the BC Assembly of First Nations, the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, and First Nations Summit.
B.C. is the first province in Canada https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-indigenous/canadas-british-columbia-takes-first-step-to-implement-u-n-accord-on-indigenous-peoples-rights-idUSKBN1X32OC to legally commit to bringing its laws up to the standards outlined in the U.N. Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).
""It is time we recognize and safeguard Indigenous peoples’ human rights, so that we may finally move away from conflict, drawn-out court cases and uncertainty, and move forward with collaboration and respect.""
The statement cautioned that ""change won't happen overnight,"" and the process of bringing B.C's laws in line with UNDRIP ""will be a gradual, step-by-step process over time.""
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government attempted to pass a law that would commit Canada to UNDRIP's standards during its first term in power, but the bill stalled due to criticisms that it would give indigenous groups a veto on future energy projects.
Both the Mining Association of British Columbia and the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce have cautiously endorsed B.C.'s bill.
It must now receive royal assent, and is expected to be formally passed into law before the legislature's current session ends on Thursday."

Police described it as the first ""narcosubmarine"" to be intercepted in Europe, adding in a statement that it had been found in waters off the northwestern region of Galicia on Saturday, stuffed with 152 neatly-wrapped bales of cocaine.
The estimated street value of the drugs is 100 million euros ($110.22 million), Javier Losada, head of the central government delegation in Galicia, told reporters on Wednesday.
""This is a historic operation, one that will mark a before and after for security forces as they now contend with this new possibility,"" Losada said.
Video released by Spanish police on Wednesday showed divers entering the rusty vessel through a small top hatch before they refloated it using air bags.
Spanish officials said they were initially tipped off about the vessel by an inter-governmental working group on drug smuggling, setting off a search that tracked down the submarine on Saturday night.
Rough waters had complicated efforts to transfer the drugs to another boat, leading the suspects to sink the submarine before abandoning it. As they did so, they were spotted by patrolling officers, police said.
Police arrested an Ecuadorian national on the scene who was wearing a wetsuit. On Sunday morning a second Ecuadorian was arrested while a third suspect remains on the run.
Police, noting that the use of submarines to transport drugs in the Americas is quite common, described the submarine as ""homemade"" and capable of transporting between three and five tons of cocaine.
It was later transported to a port in Cangas, in Pontevedra province, where the cocaine-filled packages were removed from the interior, police added.
The investigation continues, as police work to determine the origin of the drugs and who they were destined for.
Spanish police said the operation also relied on help from police forces from Brazil, Portugal and the United States."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States rejected on Wednesday a suggestion it seek a prisoner swap involving a former U.S. Marine jailed in Russia for nearly a year over spying allegations, and called for his immediate release.
Paul Whelan, who holds U.S., British, Canadian and Irish passports, was detained by agents from Russia's Federal Security Service in a Moscow hotel room on Dec. 28 last year.
After a U.S. diplomat visited him in jail on Wednesday, the U.S. embassy complained about Whelan's declining health and called Russia's treatment of him ""shameful"", saying Moscow had refused to allow the diplomat to bring him Thanksgiving dinner.
Moscow says Whelan was caught red-handed with a computer flash drive containing classified information. Whelan says he was set up in a sting and had thought the drive, given to him by a Russian acquaintance, contained holiday photos.
He has been held in pre-trial detention while investigators look into his case.
Whelan's Russian lawyer earlier this month urged the United States and other countries to push for a prisoner swap with Moscow that could get his client released.
But Julie Fisher, the chargée d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, dismissed any such exchange.
""There is no need to discuss a swap,"" Fisher told reporters after visiting Whelan in prison. ""There is no evidence, no crime,"" said Fisher. ""They need to release him. Paul has not been charged with a crime.""
Fisher also complained about what she said was Whelan's declining health and about what she said was the Russian refusal to allow an outside doctor into prison to examine him.
He had not been allowed a single phone call to his family during the 11 months of his detention, and the U.S. Embassy said Fisher had not been allowed even to deliver Whelan a Thanksgiving dinner on Wednesday.
""Russian authorities denied Paul Whelan the minor comfort of a Thanksgiving dinner today. As American families around the world gather, Paul marks 11 months in prison and can’t even call his parents. This is shameful treatment,"" tweeted Rebecca Ross, the U.S. Embassy's spokeswoman."

Judge Emmett Sullivan had been expected to put off sentencing after both Flynn, who has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents, and the United States filed a joint motion to request the delay, citing the expected December release of the Justice Department inspector general's report on the origins of investigations into alleged Russian election interference. The inspector general said last week he expects to release the report on Dec. 9.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO on Wednesday awarded Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co a $1 billion contract to upgrade its fleet of AWACS reconnaissance planes, a deal officials said showed the strength of transatlantic cooperation days before an alliance summit in London.
First flown in 1982 and repeatedly modernized, the Boeing-made planes, which can detect hostile aircraft, missiles, ships and other weaponry far beyond NATO borders, will be overhauled with more powerful computer processors, servers and equipment. 
The 14 planes, based at an air base in Germany, can already exchange information via digital data links, with ground-based, sea-based and airborne commanders, but need a greater capacity to transmit data as technology develops.
The upgrade will keep one of the few military assets owned and operated by the Western alliance in service until 2035.
AWACS have been flown in support of the international coalition against Islamic State, gazing deep into Syria from Turkey, as well as along NATO's eastern flank following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
""The modernization will ensure that NATO remains at the leading edge of technology,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference alongside Boeing President Michael Arthur, standing in front of one of the planes.
""It will provide AWACS with sophisticated new communications and networking capabilities, so these aircraft can continue their vital missions,"" he said.
One NATO official described AWACS, which have crews drawn from 18 different allies, as a symbol of NATO unity, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has questioned its value and French President Emmanuel Macron last month said NATO was dying.
The upgrade will be funded by 16 NATO allies, including the United States, Germany, Turkey, Italy and Spain, and some work will be subcontracted to European suppliers including Leonardo and Airbus.
The modernization comes as NATO takes delivery of the first of five Global Hawk drones, which will be based in Italy.
After years of delays, the high-altitude drones made by  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) give the alliance its own spy drones for the first time and will work with the AWACS to protect ground troops, as well as other tasks. 

The drones will be able to fly for up to 30 hours at a time in all weather, providing near real-time surveillance data.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 12:11PM ET</span>","Iran says 200,000 took to streets in anti-government protests","By Babak Dehghanpisheh
GENEVA (Reuters) - Iran gave a glimpse on Wednesday into the scale of what may have been the biggest anti-government protests in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic, with an official saying 200,000 people had taken part and a lawmaker saying 7,000 were arrested.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his strongest remarks since the unrest peaked, described the two weeks of violence as the work of a ""very dangerous conspiracy"".
He also said the unrest, initially sparked by fuel price hikes but which then spiraled, had been completely quelled.
Iran has given no official death toll, but Amnesty International said this week it had documented the deaths of at least 143 protesters. Tehran has rejected this figure.
A number anywhere close to that would make it the deadliest anti-government unrest at least since the authorities put down ""Green Revolution"" protests that surrounded the disputed 2009 presidential election, and probably since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah and swept clerics to power.
Details of the unrest have been difficult to report from outside Iran, especially after the authorities shut down the internet for a week.
Residents and state media said mobile Internet was restored in the capital Tehran and several other areas on Wednesday, after fixed-line internet was partially reconnected on Monday.
The Intelligence Ministry said at least eight people linked to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had been arrested during the unrest.
""These elements had received CIA-funded training in various countries under the cover of becoming citizen-journalists,"" the state news agency IRNA quoted the ministry as saying.
""Six were arrested while attending the riots and carrying out (CIA) orders, and two while trying to...send information abroad,"" a ministry statement said. 
The violence comes as Iran's economy has been hit by tighter U.S. sanctions that have slashed oil exports this year, and as mass demonstrations have erupted in Iraq and Lebanon against governments built around prominent pro-Iran factions.
""THUGS""
The Tehran government has blamed ""thugs"" linked to its opponents in exile and the country's main foreign foes, namely the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Disturbances began on Nov. 15 after the government of the Islamic Republic, one of OPEC's biggest oil producers, announced gasoline price hikes. But protests quickly turned political, with demonstrators demanding the removal of top leaders.
""A deep, vast and very dangerous conspiracy that a lot of money had been spent on...was destroyed by the people,"" Khamenei told a meeting with the paramilitary Basij force that took part in the crackdown on protests, his official website said.
Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said 731 banks, 70 petrol stations and 140 government sites had been torched. More than 50 bases used by security forces were attacked, he said, in remarks reported by IRNA.
According to IRNA, Rahmani Fazli said up to 200,000 people took part nationwide in the unrest. Hossein Naqavi-Hosseini, a member of parliament's national security committee, said about 7,000 people had been arrested, news website Entekhab reported.
Ordinary Iranians have faced an increasingly tough struggle to make ends meet since last year when Washington quit a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Under the pact, U.S. and other international sanctions on Iran were eased in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
The U.S. administration says sanctions aim to force Tehran to negotiate a more comprehensive deal, covering everything from its nuclear ambitions to Iran's activities around the Middle East. Iran says it won't hold talks until sanctions are lifted.
Daily gasoline consumption has fallen by about 20 million liters a day since prices were hiked, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency. Daily consumption had been about 98 million liters before the rise, state fuel distribution company NIOPDC said on Tuesday. 
Washington's policy of imposing ""maximum pressure"" has hammered Iran's oil-reliant economy, which has been struggling to deal with rising inflation, growing unemployment, a slumping rial currency and state corruption.

The government said the gasoline price rises of at least 50% aimed to raise about $2.55 billion a year to fund extra subsidies for 18 million families on low incomes.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Suspected Islamist rebels have killed about 15 people in east Congo, an official said on Wednesday, the latest in attacks causing anger at perceived inaction of the army and U.N. troops.
The raid occurred overnight in the village of Malika, near the city of Oicha in a forested region near the Ugandan border, said Donat Kibwana, the administrator of Beni territory.
Kibwana blamed the attack on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a jihadist rebel group originally from Uganda that has operated for decades in Congo. They have killed at least 80 people in 14 raids since the army launched an operation against them late last month, according to U.N figures.
""It is deplorable what I just saw at the morgue of the general hospital of Oicha. The attackers massacred civilians with knives. I counted 15 dead,"" Kibwana told Reuters by phone.
ADF personnel were not reachable for comment.
Several previous ADF attacks have been claimed by Islamic State, but the extent of their relationship remains unclear.
Recent attacks sparked protests in the city of Beni, 20 km (12 miles) south of Oicha, driven by accusations that the army and United Nations are not doing enough to protect people.
Protesters burned down the mayor's office and damaged U.N. facilities on Monday, forcing some health workers helping to combat an Ebola epidemic into lockdown and others to leave.
At least four people have died during protests in Beni and nearby Butembo this week. On Wednesday the protests spread to Goma, the regional capital, where activists have called for a two-day strike starting on Thursday.
One protester was allegedly killed during an exchange with U.N. peacekeepers in Beni on Monday, the United Nations said, adding that it would open an investigation.
The U.N. peacekeeping mission said in a statement on Wednesday that it would be unable to end the ADF's violence if its forces were under attack from local people."

The New START accord, which is due to expire in February 2021, is the last major nuclear arms control treaty between Moscow and Washington. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads they can deploy to 1,550 each.
Russia warned earlier this month there was already not enough time left for Moscow and Washington to negotiate a full-fledged replacement to the treaty and that time was running out to agree on an extension.
""We proposed to the United States extending the treaty by five years as stipulated in it, or, if for some reason that is uncomfortable for the U.S. side, then for a shorter period of time...,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Wednesday, RIA news agency reported.
Ryabkov, who made the comments after meeting his Chinese counterpart in China, said a shorter extension would not be the best outcome, but that it would be ""at least better than nothing"".
U.S. President Donald Trump told Russia's President Vladimir Putin in 2017 he thought the New START accord was a bad deal for the United States. U.S. officials say he will only decide next year whether or not to extend the treaty.

James, a big name in British television and radio in the 1980s, was influential in media circles and won awards for journalism and broadcasting.
His often coarse, dead-pan style peaked in popularity in the 1980s with the show ""Clive James on Television"", in which he lampooned clips of absurd international television shows, in particular a Japanese contest called ""Endurance"".
He wrote a newspaper column titled ""Reports of My Death"" in The Guardian after being diagnosed with leukemia in 2010. In 2016 he said his longevity after announcing his illness was ""embarrassing"".
As comfortable writing about low-brow as well as intellectual culture, his self-deprecating book of memoirs ""Unreliable Memories"" was a bestseller reprinted dozens of times.
His book ""Cultural Amnesia"", comprising short essays about more than 100 people who fascinated him - including writers Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka, filmmaker Federico Fellini and musicians from Duke Ellington to Erik Satie - testified to the breadth of his cultural and intellectual interests.
James acted as informal adviser to Britain's Prince Charles and his ex-wife Diana, something he wrote about in a searingly honest portrayal of their friendship and the phenomenon of Diana's popularity after her death in a car crash in Paris in 1997.
Vivian Leopold James was born in Sydney in 1939, changing his name to Clive as a child. He moved to England in 1962 and, after graduating from Cambridge University, remained there for the rest of his life.
He died at his home in Cambridge on Sunday, his agents said.
James taught himself French by reading the novels of Marcel Proust with a dictionary, joking that he ""might have forgotten to say it took me 15 years"". He also spoke Russian, Japanese, German and Italian."

Moscow police did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The green solution, known as ""zelyonka,"" is sold as an antiseptic in Russian pharmacies and is hard to wash off.
In recent years, several opposition activists and politicians have been attacked with the substance.
Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running against President Vladimir Putin in last year's elections, was splashed with the substance during a campaign stop in the Siberian city of Barnaul in March 2017.
A month later, he suffered a serious chemical burn to his right eye as a result of another attack with the dye.

Ashmawy, a former Egyptian special forces officer, was apprehended in the eastern Libyan city of Derna late last year and transferred to Egypt in May.
He was convicted on several charges including plotting a 2014 attack that killed 22 military guards near the frontier with Libya, and involvement in an assassination attempt on a former interior minister in 2013, a military statement said.
Ashmawy led the Sinai-based Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, Egypt's most active militant group, before it pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014, it said.
He moved with a group of followers to Egypt's Western Desert, then transferred across the border to Libya to join the al Qaeda-linked Ansar al-Sharia, it added. In 2015 he announced that he had founded a new group called al-Mourabitoun.
Egyptian civilian and military courts had sentenced Ashmawy to death in absentia before his extradition.
Earlier this month, an Egyptian military court sentenced to death Abdelrahim Mohamed al-Mesmari, a suspected Libyan militant convicted over a deadly attack on a police patrol in Egypt's western desert in 2017.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The crisis sweeping Lebanon has taken a violent turn this week with three nights of skirmishes that have prompted warnings of bloodshed and revived memories of the 1975-90 civil war.
Trouble flared in several areas of Lebanon on Tuesday night, including the Beirut district of Ain el-Remmaneh, where the civil war began. The army deployed to prevent a confrontation between supporters of rival Christian and Shi'ite Muslim groups.
A senior Shi'ite cleric warned on Wednesday the street could spin out of control and push ""our nation into a slide towards anarchy"". Sheikh Ali al-Khatib urged politicians to ""remedy the situation and contain the deterioration"".
Lebanon has been sinking deeper into turmoil since protests erupted against its ruling elite on Oct. 17, fueled by anger at corruption that has led to the worst economic crisis in decades.
The economic crisis, which was long in the making, has now come to a head: dollars are scarce, the pegged Lebanese pound has slumped by more than 40%, and controls imposed by banks are preventing depositors from withdrawing their savings.
In parallel, a political crisis has left Lebanon without a government since Sunni Muslim politician Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister on Oct. 29, bringing down a coalition that included the heavily armed, Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah.
Though violence has been rare since the protests began, this week's incidents included assaults by supporters of Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally Amal on demonstrators in Beirut and the city of Tyre, where a protest camp set was set on fire.
Tuesday's incident in Beirut began when a three-year-old video showing men insulting Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah began to circulate on social media, according to a security source.
Believing the men in the video to be supporters of the Christian Lebanese Forces party from Ain el-Remmaneh, a group of from the neighboring Shi'ite district of Chiyah took to the streets. The army deployed as rocks began to fly.
With tension among party supporters running high, the security source warned that ""playing with the street is very dangerous"". ""All the while the political matters are not being resolved, the security pressures are getting more dangerous.""
Ali, the owner of a cafe on a road between Chiyah and Ain el-Remmeneh, said the situation had been ""unbelievably tense"". 
""The situation in the country is not okay and things like this should not be allowed to happen, because our country cannot bear it. As a Shi'ite, I cannot accept that the Shi'ite side does this to the Christian side, and I cannot accept the Christian side does this to the Shi'ite side.""
The area was a front line of the civil war which began as a conflict between Lebanese Christian groups on the one hand and Palestinian, Lebanese leftist and Sunni Muslim groups on the other, and fractured Lebanon into sectarian enclaves. 
DANGER OF ARMED CLASHES
Jamileh al Jaroush, in her 50s, who lives on the street dividing Chiyah from Ain el-Remmaneh, said she had been praying for God to calm the situation. ""Those who did not witness the previous civil war don't know the meaning of war ... it is impossible to repeat it."" 
There was also trouble in the Christian town of Bikfaya when supporters of President Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian and Hezbollah ally, tried to drive a convoy through the area, a political bastion of the Kataeb party which opposes Hezbollah.
As people sought to block the road to prevent the Aoun supporters from passing, the army tried to open it, the security source said. A few people were lightly injured in clashes with sticks and stones.
There were also disturbances in the mainly Sunni Muslim city of Tripoli, where an office belonging to the political party founded by Aoun was attacked, along with a bank ATM. A hand grenade was thrown but did not explode, the source said.
The incidents have taken the crisis into a more dangerous phase, said Nabil Boumonsef, a columnist at an-Nahar newspaper. While the number of casualties had so far been limited, the violence would become harder to contain.
""If there is not a quick, political containment of the crisis, we are facing the danger of armed clashes,"" he said.

He noted that while only Hezbollah has heavy weaponry, light arms are widely dispersed throughout Lebanon. ""When you find problems of this type, you will find that weapons will spread in five seconds into the hands of everyone,"" he said.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Ankara will resist efforts by its NATO allies to persuade it to back an alliance defence plan for the Baltics and Poland until its demands are met over a plan for Turkey's defence, a Turkish diplomatic source said on Wednesday.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Turkey was refusing to back the plan for the Baltics and Poland unless it got more political support for its fight against Kurdish YPG militia in northern Syria.
Turkey wants NATO to formally recognise the YPG militia, the main component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as terrorists and is infuriated that its allies have given the militia support.
The Turkish source said NATO had agreed this year to back the alliance plan for defence of Turkey, including in the event of an attack from the south, where it borders Syria.
The plan included recognising the YPG as a terrorist threat to Ankara, but Washington later withdrew its support and other countries then opposed it too, the source added
""So, we are saying that if ours (defence plan) isn't published, we won't allow the other (plan for the Baltics and Poland to be published) either,"" the source said. ""Those who want us to publish the plan for the Baltics must then show the same awareness for ours as well.""
A week before a NATO summit in London, alliance envoys are seeking formal approval by all 29 members for the military plan to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the event of a Russian attack.
Asked about the issue, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg declined to give details of the internal discussions but said: ""We have plans in place to defend and protect all allies and our commitment to collective defence is ironclad.""
""Not only do we have plans, but we have more ready forces, a modernised command structures and more capabilities that we have had for decades,"" Stoltenberg said.
The start of a Turkish offensive in northeast Syria last month was condemned by its NATO allies, who fear it could hinder the battle against Islamic State. Turkey has rejected the concerns, saying it will continue to battle all terrorists in the region, which it says includes the U.S.-backed YPG.
The Turkish source said Stoltenberg was trying to find common ground between the member states on the defence plan for Turkey and that Ankara as ""open to offers."""

PARIS/BAMAKO (Reuters) - France will never secure total victory over Islamist insurgents in West Africa, its top general said on Wednesday, after 13 soldiers died in a helicopter crash during a combat mission in Mali, France's worst single loss of troops for 36 years.
General Francois Lecointre said France's military role in the Sahel region south of the Sahara was ""useful, good and necessary"", but it was hard to see the moment when the war would finally be won.
The remarks could embolden opponents of President Emmanuel Macron, in particular on the far-left, who are demanding France plots a way out of the conflict.
""We will never achieve a definitive victory,"" Lecointre, chief of staff of the armed forces, told France Inter radio.
The 13 French soldiers were killed in Mali on Monday when two helicopters collided in the dark after being called in to provide air support during a combat mission to track down a band of Islamic State militant fighters.
One source said the operation was in reaction to an attack in Indelimane, Menaka region, in late October that killed at least 53 Malian soldiers and was claimed by Islamic State.
France intervened in Mali in 2013 to repel insurgents advancing out of northern strongholds into central Mali. There are now 4,500 French troops in the wider region, as part of ""operation Barkhane"", named for a crescent-shaped sand dune.
However, Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have strengthened their foothold. Swathes of the arid Sahel region are ungovernable.
""We're getting results but we have to be patient and persevering,"" Lecointre said.
The two black boxes from the Tiger attack helicopter and the Cougar multipurpose helicopter have been recovered, military officials said, and will be central to the investigation into how the accident occurred.
""RED ZONE""
The defense minister, Florence Parly, arrived in Mali to pay tribute to the soldiers who died. France hopes to repatriate the soldiers' bodies in the days ahead.
Ground commandos had been tracking the group of militants through harsh terrain for several days before making contact on Monday in the Valley of Eranga, central Mali. Air support was called in after a gun-battle erupted.
One local resident described the region where the collision occurred as lawless and overrun by jihadists.
""We call it the red zone. No-one dares wander that way,"" the resident said, declining to be identified for fear of retribution.
The area has been a focal point for recent French operations against Islamic State affiliated militants, according to Menastream, a risk consultancy group that monitors jihadist activity in the region.
France has complained to European allies that it is bearing the brunt of a counter-terrorism operation that benefits all Europe.
In June, amid a spike in militant attacks, France urged European powers to provide special forces to support the G5 Sahel force - made up of thousands of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania - as it struggled to contain a rise in violence.
Commitments so far had been minimal and the deaths of the French troops would not encourage more, one western diplomat in West Africa said.
""No European government is keen on body bags,"" the diplomat said."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Wednesday paid tribute to a late Soviet intelligence officer it credits with helping foil a Nazi plot to kill Winston Churchill, Josef Stalin and Franklin Roosevelt, saying her career may have changed the course of history.
Goar Vartanyan, who died on Monday at the age of 93, was an undercover field operative for decades and allegedly helped thwart a plan backed by Adolf Hitler to assassinate the allied leaders at their first ""Big Three"" conference in Tehran in 1943.
Born in Armenia in 1926, Vartanyan moved to Iran in the 1930s where, at the age of 16, she joined an anti-fascist group led by her future husband, Soviet spy Gevork Vartanyan, that was tasked with ensuring security for the World War Two conference.
The Soviet group, which had already unmasked more than 400 Nazi agents in Iran, identified a group of Nazi assassins ahead of the conference and arrested them, causing the plot, known as Operation Long Jump, to fail, Gevork Vartanyan has said.
""Without Goar Vartanyan and her husband Gevork, the history of our world could have been different. These are people who left their mark on the history of mankind,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.
The couple went on to work as undercover spies, known in Moscow as ""illegals"", in an array of countries from 1956 to 1986 after which Goar retired and began to train future agents, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said.
President Vladimir Putin, who himself served as a KGB officer in East Germany in the late Cold War, expressed his condolences to Vartanyan's family and relatives.
""Putin knew both Goar and her husband well... Goar visited Putin in the Kremlin, Putin visited her as a guest,"" Peskov told reporters.
Gevork Vartanyan, who was bestowed the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the country's highest honor, died in 2012 at the age of 87 and was buried at a ceremony attended by Putin.
""He is a Hero of the Soviet Union! She is the heroine of all his achievements! He passed away first. She passed away today,"" the SVR said on Monday, announcing her death.
It referred to Goar by the code name ""Anita"" and Gevork as ""Anri"".
""Together with her husband... they were one of our most beautiful, charming and at the same time productive couples among our intelligence illegals,"" SVR chief Sergei Naryshkin said."

OSLO (Reuters) - The global casualty toll of landmines doubled in 2018 from a 2013 low due to conflicts in Afghanistan, Syria and Mali and mostly due to the increased use of improvised landmines set by militant groups such as Islamic State.
Representatives from affected nations, non-governmental organizations and donor countries are gathered in Oslo this week to discuss how to achieve the stated aim of making the world free of landmines in 2025.
Landmines killed or injured some 6,897 people in 2018, according to the Landmine Monitor report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Some 71% of the casualties were civilians, and of these, over half were children, it said.
In 2018, most casualties were due to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) laid by non-state groups, the report added.
The lowest globally recorded number was set at 3,457 casualties in 2013.
Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said that in order to reduce the casualty toll it was necessary to engage with non-state actors, acknowledging that it was ""very difficult"" to do.
""We have to take on that challenge,"" Soereide said in an interview. The Nordic country is one of the top donor countries for demining work, with $40 million pledged to 20 countries in 2018 and 2019 respectively. No new money will be pledged at this week's conference.
Iraq is the world's most contaminated country with landmines, partly due to the mines laid by Islamic State to defend the territory it once controlled over Iraq and Syria.
Iraq was already heavily contaminated as a result of the 2003 invasion by the U.S.-led coalition, the 1991 Gulf War and the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
But this has only increased since Islamic State's presence and now at least 1,818 sq km (702 sq miles) are contaminated - an area bigger than London - according to a report prepared for the conference by the Mine Action Review research group.
""It was done on an industrial scale. Islamic State had production lines, they set serial numbers on the devices,"" said Portia Stratton, Iraq Country Director for MAG, a British non-governmental organization working in northern Iraq, including the districts of Sinjar, Tel Afar and Tel Kaif and around Mosul.
""We find mine belts surrounding cities and villages and multiple rows of interlinked mine belts running across agricultural fields,"" she told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.
Homes in both cities and villages are also laid with landmines and IEDs and MAG wants to conduct demining inside Mosul, Iraq's third-largest city with 2 million inhabitants, depending on funding, she added."
1433,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 10:46AM ET</span>",Iraq protesters block roads to press for sweeping reforms,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Protesters blocked roads with burning tyres in southern Iraq and clashed with police in Baghdad on Wednesday, aiming to use economic disruption as leverage to push the government from power and root out state corruption.
In Iraq's southern oil capital of Basra, demonstrators prevented government employees getting to work by installing concrete barriers painted as mock-up coffins of relatives killed in weeks of unrest, a Reuters witness said. 
Iraq's large and mainly peaceful protests are the most complex challenge to a Shi'ite Muslim-dominated ruling class that has controlled state institutions and patronage networks since a 2003 U.S.-led invasion toppled Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein.
Young, mostly Shi'ite protesters say politicians are corrupt and blame them for Iraq's failure to recover from decades of conflict and sanctions despite two years of relative calm following the defeat of Islamic State. 
Security forces shot dead more demonstrators. In the holy city of Kerbala, south of Baghdad, they used live ammunition against protesters, killing two overnight. Two more were killed in clashes near Ahrar Bridge in Baghdad on Wednesday.
Near Basra one protester died of wounds from gunfire, police and medics said, bringing the toll since unrest broke out on Oct. 1 to 344 people dead nationwide.
""First we were demanding reform and an end to corruption,"" said Ali Nasser, an unemployed engineering graduate protesting in Basra. 
""But after the government started killing peaceful protesters we won't leave before it's been toppled together with the corrupt ruling class."" 
Government reform has amounted to little more than a handful of state jobs for graduates, stipends for poor people and vague promises of electoral reform which lawmakers have barely begun discussing.
""The reforms are just words. We want actions. We've had 16 years of words without actions. We have been robbed for 16 years,"" said Alia, a 23-year-old medical student.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi expressed concern over both the violence and the financial toll of unrest in a televised cabinet meeting late on Tuesday, but mostly blamed unidentified saboteurs for the damage.
""There have been martyrs among protesters and security forces, many wounded and arrested ... we're trying to identify mistakes"" made by security forces in trying to put down the protests, he said.
""The blocking of ports has cost billions of dollars ... and many buildings have been burned,"" he said. 
Protesters have repeatedly blocked traffic into Iraq's main commodities port near Basra this month and have tried to surround the Central Bank in Baghdad, apparently determined to cause economic disruption where simple calls for removal of the government have failed.

The government is moving slowly in enacting any kind of change. Promises of electoral reform and an early general election have yet to be ratified by parliament, and the political class has closed ranks in the face of a significant challenge to its grip on power.

Lopez Obrador said Mexico would take up the issue after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and that he had asked his foreign minister to lead talks. 
""Cooperation, yes, intervention, no"" Lopez Obrador said in a morning news conference when asked about Trump's comments.
Cartels ""will be"" designated, Trump said in an interview with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, broadcast on Tuesday, adding he had been working for 90 days on the process.
A growing chorus of conservative voices in the United States has called for Mexican cartels to be classified as terrorist groups after the killing of nine Americans with dual Mexican nationality in Mexico earlier this month. 
At the weekend, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said such a designation could, under U.S. law, enable the United States to act directly against the threat if it so chose.
In a post on Twitter on Wednesday, Ebrard said he was already in contact with U.S. counterparts and that his effrots would be focused on defending Mexico's sovereignty."" 
The U.S. State Department includes dozens of organizations on its list of terrorist groups. Most of them are Islamist, separatist or Marxist insurgents. In Latin America, Colombia's left-wing guerrilla and right-wing paramilitaries, both involved in drug trafficking, have in the past appeared on the list. 
Once a particular group is designated as a terrorist organization, it is illegal under U.S. law for people in the United States to knowingly offer support and its members cannot enter the country and may be deported.
Experts foresee more pressure from Trump over Mexican drug gangs in the lead-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, echoing his earlier use of tariff threats to persuade Mexico to clamp down on illegal immigration.
Trump said Lopez Obrador, who he considered ""a good man,"" had declined his previous offers to ""let us go in and clean it out."" 

""But as some point something has to be done,"" he said.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 10:45AM ET</span>",U.N. refugees chief urges Greece to improve 'miserable' camp conditions,"LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees urged the Greek government on Wednesday to improve living conditions in migrant camps and said Europe must do more to protect unaccompanied children.
Greece's new conservative government has taken a tougher stance than its leftist predecessor on the migrant crisis, saying it will ""shut the door"" to people not entitled to stay in the country.
It has announced plans to shut overcrowded refugee camps and replace them with detention centers to be used both as an ante-room for deporting failed asylum seekers and as a reception and processing center for new arrivals.
""We cannot accept that they (refugees) live in such miserable living conditions. The conditions are very challenging and need urgent improvement,"" Commissioner Filippo Grandi told reporters after visiting camps on the island of Lesbos.
Arrivals of migrants from neighboring Turkey have risen again in recent months, with more than 37,000 people crammed into facilities on eastern Aegean islands that operate far beyond their capacity.
Last week the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) raised concerns over the new centers, saying they may provide better living conditions but could eventually turn into prisons for people who seek safety and are trapped ""in an endless drama"".
Grandi said Greece was the most impacted among the EU's coastal states from the migrant crisis and asked for a collective European solution to protect unaccompanied minors.
""I am very worried about children, especially children traveling alone, they are the most exposed to violence and exploitation,"" said Grandi who was due to meet Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis later in the day.
On Lesbos, the Moria camp is one of the centers set to close and be replaced by a closed facility. Created to accommodate about 3,000 people, it now houses more than 15,000 in conditions aid agencies say are abysmal.
The government wants to move up to 20,000 people to the mainland by the end of the year and expects the new facilities to be ready by July 2020. State authorities believe that more than 80,000 migrants and refugees are currently in Greece."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis named a respected senior Bank of Italy official on Wednesday to head the Vatican's financial regulator, following unprecedented police raids on the organization as part of an investigation into the purchase of luxury London real estate.
Carmelo Barbagallo, 63, former head of supervision at Italy's central bank, succeeds Swiss lawyer Rene Bruelhart as head of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF). 
Bruelhart left last week after five years in the post when the pope did not renew his mandate. 
Vatican police entered the offices of the AIF and of the Secretariat of State - the administrative heart of the Catholic Church - on Oct. 1, as part of their investigation of an investment the Secretariat had made in London real estate.
The officers, operating under a search warrant secured by the Vatican's own prosecutor, seized documents, computers and cellphones during the raids.
The head of the Secretariat, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said last month the property deal had not been transparent and promised to shed light on it. The AIF board has said it did nothing wrong when it looked over the property investment. 
The raids prompted concerns in the international financial community about the AIF's ability to keep confidential documents secure.
The Toronto-based Egmont Group of financial intelligence units, an informal organization with about 165 members, then suspended the AIF from using its secure communications network.
Two of the five members of the AIF board resigned to protest against what they saw as a weakening of the AIF's independence as a result of the raids.
Bruelhart, who had presided over the board, is a former vice-chair of Egmont. Egmont's acceptance of the Vatican six years ago was seen as a major step forward in cleaning up the Vatican's negative image following years of scandals.
The pope's choice of Barbagallo, a 40-year Bank of Italy veteran, appeared to be an attempt to assuage fears of instability in the AIF.
""I intend to reassure the international system of financial information that all cooperation will be given in full respect of the best international standards,"" Barbagallo said in a statement.
Pope Francis said at the weekend the Vatican was looking forward to a scheduled evaluation next year by Moneyval, a monitoring body of the Council of Europe which has recently given the Vatican's financial reforms mostly positive reviews.

Five Vatican employees remain suspended, including AIF director Tommaso di Ruzza. Domenico Giani, Vatican security chief and the pope's bodyguard, resigned later over the leak of a document related to the investigation.

LA PAZ/COCHABAMBA, Bolivia (Reuters) - Bolivia's interim government has named an ambassador to the United States for the first time in over a decade, amid a redrawing of the South American nation's international ties that has seen traditional allies Venezuela and Cuba shunned.
Bolivian foreign policy has shifted sharply under the leadership of conservative interim President Jeanine Anez, a senator who took over amid a power vacuum when long-term leftist leader Evo Morales resigned under pressure earlier this month.
On Tuesday, Anez's foreign minister nominated Walter Oscar Serrate Cuellar as ambassador to the United States, the first such action since 2008 when diplomatic relations with Washington soured under Morales.
The appointment must be approved by Congress, where Morales' Movement to Socialism (MAS) party has a majority.
Bolivia was plunged into turmoil after the Oct. 20 presidential election was mired in controversy amid allegations it had been rigged in favor of Morales, which sparked widespread protests against him.
Morales, the country's first indigenous leader, who had been in power since 2006, stepped down on Nov. 10 after protests spread, an international audit said the October vote should be annulled, and police forces and the military withdrew support.
Anez, who has pledged to hold new elections quickly and restore peace in the divided country, has moved abruptly away from policies under Morales, expelling Venezuelan officials and edging closer to allies in Brazil and the United States.
Her administration has, however, been dogged be allegations that security forces have used excessive force against pro-Morales supporters, with human rights groups calling for an international investigation.
Since the October election 33 people have died in violent clashes, according to Bolivia's official human rights ombudsman, with the vast majority of those since Morales resigned and subsequently sought asylum in Mexico."

STRASBOURG/BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union's new boss has pledged major policy changes to address some of the bloc's biggest problems, from migration to climate change, but will need to navigate deep divisions among member countries.
German conservative Ursula von der Leyen, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will be the first woman to assume the EU's top job when she takes over as European Commission president on Dec. 1. She has vowed to take a pragmatic approach in order to build consensus to pursue policy priorities such as tackling migration, an issue that has sowed bitter divides among the EU’s 28 member states.
On Wednesday, von der Leyen said she planned to increase efforts to fight the threat of climate change while expanding economic growth as EU lawmakers gave final approval for her to take over the helm of the bloc's powerful executive in Brussels.
Speaking to Reuters last month, von der Leyen said she will travel extensively to speak to EU leaders in an attempt to bridge divisions. One of her first trips following her July nomination was to Poland, where the ruling euroskeptic government has repeatedly clashed with the EU's political hub Brussels, including over migration and climate.
""Everyone understands we may have different interests, we may want to go different in different directions, but it helps to understand that we have to tackle a problem together,"" von der Leyen told Reuters.
The daughter of a prominent German politician who also served as senior EU official, von der Leyen spent much of her childhood in Brussels. After an early career in medicine, she served as a long-time minister in Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU).
Her six years at the German defense ministry were marred by criticism from politicians, including from within her own party, over a troubled overhaul of Germany's aging military equipment and defense procurement system. Von der Leyen acknowledges that some of her efforts - including on family and gender policies - were initially unpopular within her party but says that she owes a lot to the CDU.
Von der Leyen, 61 years old, assumes her new job at a time of heightened euroskepticism that has already prompted Britain, one of the EU's largest financial contributors, to seek departure from the bloc.
As Commission president, von der Leyen will be responsible for leading negotiations with Britain on future trade arrangements if it leaves the EU, as well as navigating the bloc's trade disputes with U.S. President Donald Trump. The Commission also acts as the EU's competition watchdog and von der Leyen has signaled she would seek a further toughening of rules for tech giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
In approaching her new job, von der Leyen has set out an ambitious agenda aimed at tackling migration, combating climate change and promoting gender equality among other policy priorities.
Nearly half of her Commission team, where each member state normally has one representative, are women. She has also vowed to achieve gender equality at the end of her five-year mandate in all management jobs at the Commission.
She has pledged to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 and to toughen the target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. In order to appeal to the more carbon-intensive economies in the EU, most in the east, she has pledged extra funds to support projects that would contribute to lower emissions while not stifling the economies.
Another divisive issue that will dominate von der Leyen's first year in office are talks over the EU's next long-term budget. She wants a higher baseline budget figure in order to pay for increased spending on international efforts, climate and digital initiatives, among other areas. But some EU countries, including her native Germany, strongly oppose paying more.
""She is competent and conciliatory, she has a European vision. That's the best we can hope for and we should support her rather than expect that she single-handedly solves all EU problems,"" said Poland's former foreign minister and now a conservative EU lawmaker, Radoslaw Sikorski."

Keith Schembri, a close friend of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, resigned on Tuesday after he was named by businessman Yorgen Fenech as a ""person of interest"" in the investigation, the sources said.
The police have not officially said why Schembri was under arrest or whether he was considered a suspect in the case that has rocked Malta and led to renewed calls by opposition politicians for Muscat to resign.
Neither Schembri nor Fenech have made any public statement since their arrests and their lawyers have not responded to requests for comment.
Fenech was detained a week ago as he tried to leave Malta on his yacht, the day after news broke that the suspected middleman in the 2017 murder of Caruana Galizia had been arrested.
Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb as she drove out of her home. Three men are awaiting trial for having set off the bomb.
The suspected middleman, Melvin Theuma, was granted a presidential pardon on Monday in return for evidence that could be used in court to convict those suspected of ordering the killing. Local media reported that he had handed over audio recordings.
Caruana Galizia's family said they wanted a meeting with Malta's attorney general, Peter Grech, to discuss media reports that Fenech may also be given a pardon in return for naming senior officials who were complicit in ordering the killing.
""We urgently want to clarify the situation,"" said Paul Caruana Galizia, one of Daphne's sons.
The Times of Malta newspaper reported on Wednesday that Fenech's doctor had also been arrested on suspicion that he passed messages from Schembri to Fenech following his arrest last week, urging him to keep quiet.
The police have 48 hours within which to either charge or free people under arrest but Fenech has been arrested and released three times in quick succession as questioning and investigations continue.

The group called on Ankara to investigate what it said were human rights abuses and ""in many cases potential war crimes"" in territory which Turkish forces currently control, and hold those responsible to account.
Turkey says it plans to settle more than a million Syrian refugees in a ""safe zone"" which it says will be established by the military operation, but Human Rights Watch said its findings showed the region was not secure. 
""Executing individuals, pillaging property and blocking displaced people from returning to their homes is damning evidence of why Turkey's proposed 'safe zones' will not be safe,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, the group's Middle East director, in the statement.
Asked about the Human Rights Watch report, a spokesman for the Turkish foreign ministry pointed to earlier media reports about Syrian rebels forming a commission to investigate the reported abuses, as well as military courts for prosecution.
Last month the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces accused a Turkey-backed force of ambushing and killing a Kurdish politician, Hevrin Khalaf, and several other civilians in the first week of the offensive in northeast Syria. The rebel force denied it was responsible for the killing.
Human Rights Watch said it had researched the case of three Kurdish Red Crescent aid workers who disappeared in territory controlled by the rebels, ""including the apparent unlawful killing of at least one of them"".
The group also interviewed five Kurdish civilians who said that the rebel forces were occupying their homes and had arbitrarily prevented them from returning.
""Turkey is turning a blind eye to the reprehensible behavior displayed by the factions it arms,"" Whitson said. ""So long as Turkey is in control of these areas, it has a responsibility to investigate and end these violations"".

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya should create more senior political posts including that of prime minister and increase payments to regional governments to try to end cyclical election violence, a government report said on Wednesday.
The report, which also recommended cutting government spending, was drawn up by a commission formed following a reconciliation between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his rival Raila Odinga after a national election in which 100 people, most of them protesters, were killed in a national election in 2017.
But critics saw the findings as window dressing designed to increase the number of senior officials with access to resources, rather than as a serious attempt to tackle graft that has hollowed out social services such as health and education.
Election campaigns in Kenya are often fought by ethnically-based alliances. Voting shows strong ethnic patterns, and so does the political violence that often follows.
""A winner take-all political system has only sharpened the ethnic competition for the presidency,"" the report said. ""People want one of their own as president since resources go with the presidency.""
To combat the problem, the president should appoint a prime minister from the party with most lawmakers in parliament, the report said. Kenya's government is led by the president, and the country does not have a prime minister.
The report said county governments, which are responsible for early education, healthcare and some infrastructure, should receive at least 35% of national revenue compared to 15% now.
A 2010 constitution devolved many powers and some funding to 47 newly created counties in an earlier attempt to prevent election violence. But the county governments have struggled to fulfill their responsibilities, partly because of corruption and partly because of a lack of funds.
The report also proposed the runner-up of the presidential election become the official leader of the opposition, a new post.
""MUDDLED, INCOHERENT""
The government has failed to meet revenue collection targets and has borrowed heavily though Kenya has the region's richest economy.
Prominent anti-corruption campaigner John Githongo was scornful of the report.
""It's a muddled incoherent document full of tribal sinecures,"" Githongo said.
""It's a rather cynical vacuous document ... offered up by an elite that has raided national coffers to the point of fiscal distress - yet the document makes no acknowledgement of that."""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - In January of 1993, an ambitious Chinese Communist Party boss, a 39-year-old official with chubby cheeks and a mop of black hair, visited Hong Kong. He was seeking out the city’s rich among the shimmering skyscrapers, hoping to secure investment in Fuzhou, the second-tier city he ran in mainland China. His name was Xi Jinping.
That August, Xi received a guest back home. Hong Kong’s most famous tycoon, Li Ka-shing, known locally as “superman” for his business acumen, had come to town. A photograph from the event shows Xi grinning as he walked beside Li, who held a bouquet of flowers in his hand. In the background, a long banner hung with the message to “warmly welcome” Li Ka-shing.
During those days, in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, Beijing was desperate to fire up a languishing economy. National leaders and provincial potentates were courting Li for his cash and the star power his name brought to development projects on the mainland. That time has passed.
Xi is now the strongman leader of a rich and rising power that controls Hong Kong. Instead of feting the 91-year-old businessman, Beijing has harangued him for failing to deliver in the rebellious city. When the Party was looking for a chorus of influential voices to counter the protests that began this summer, Li offered only even-handed pleas for restraint. In an online video of comments he made at a monastery, Li asked that the leadership show “humanity” when dealing with young protesters.
The response was brutal. The Party’s central legal affairs commission in Beijing publicly accused Li of “harboring criminality” and “watching Hong Kong slip into the abyss.” A pro-Beijing trade union leader in Hong Kong posted a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) item mocking him as the “king of cockroaches” with an image that pasted Li’s head atop a picture of a fat insect.
“In the world of social media, some people are hard at work in sowing toxic doubts and disinformation to undermine trust,” Li said in a written response to questions from Reuters. “It is hard not to be drawn into controversies (in) these times.”
As the Beijing-backed government of Hong Kong cracks down on the demonstrators in the streets, there is another tightening of the leash happening, mostly behind the scenes: China’s efforts to throttle the power of Hong Kong’s tycoons.
Li and other tycoons have long held dominion over Hong Kong, tracing its post-World War II economic rise through manufacturing, real estate and finance. But the ascent of Xi Jinping, who became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, has fundamentally altered the status quo.
Xi is a leader who “thinks that he is like the emperor,” said Willy Lam Wo-lap, a veteran observer of elite Beijing politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “So, he thinks that Hong Kong business people should definitely profess undying loyalty to the emperor, to Xi Jinping.”
The vilification of the city’s preeminent capitalist was a rare public display of the new power dynamic, businessmen and analysts say. It sent a clear message that Li and his fellow Hong Kong tycoons must toe the line and unequivocally condemn the protests, which present the most serious challenge to Communist Party rule since Tiananmen.
The now-scrapped legislation that sparked the recent unrest would have allowed for extraditions from Hong Kong to mainland China. It also provided an avenue for the seizure of assets, according to a statement by the Hong Kong Bar Association. That could have exposed the city’s tycoons to the same fate as wealthy mainlanders who have been stripped of assets in Xi’s anti-corruption drive.
Shortly after protests over the bill escalated in early June, some wealthy Hong Kongers began moving money outside of the region or setting up accounts that would allow them to do so, according to six private bankers whose institutions collectively handle hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.
Reuters spoke with half a dozen people, including current Li executives, who have had personal relationships with the property mogul or worked alongside him over his career. Li stepped down last year and was succeeded by his eldest son as chairman of his two main companies but remains the biggest shareholder.
China’s foreign ministry declined to answer questions from Reuters. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment.
RISK OF OFFENDING
For all the vitriol aimed at Li in recent months, this was not a sudden split. Before protests convulsed Hong Kong, he was already loosening his economic ties to China.
At the start of this century, his flagship Hutchison Whampoa Ltd got much of its money from Hong Kong and the mainland: 56% of earnings before interest and taxes. Last year that figure at his current flagship firm was 14%. Since 2015, Li's corporate empire has been involved with more than $70 billion in acquisitions globally. Less than $1 billion of that was in Hong Kong and mainland China, according to a Reuters analysis of Li’s deals worth $500 million or more.
Asked about those numbers, a spokesperson for Li said that as Hutchison Whampoa sought large acquisitions overseas in the late 1990s and early 2000s, ""the diversification changed the geographical proportions, but we are nevertheless growing in the mainland and in Hong Kong.” In addition, the spokesperson said, a 2015 reorganization of the group brought down the proportion of earnings from the region for the current flagship.
Shifting large business interests out of China’s immediate orbit carries the risk of offending mainland officials, especially as Beijing exerts greater control of Hong Kong, said Simon Murray, a former managing director at Li’s sprawling corporate operation who has known the billionaire for decades.
“Everybody who is anybody at all in Hong Kong has got one eye on how the mainland sees that,” he said. “And you’ve got to build your bridges with them, otherwise they could confiscate.”
For Li, a billionaire in his autumnal years, the tensions with Beijing mark a dramatic turn. For decades, he enjoyed a position of eminence under Deng Xiaoping and then Jiang Zemin - the two men who led China from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. Li was on committees that drafted Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the mini-constitution governing the city since it was handed to Beijing by the British, and on a body that selected its first government.
Li’s entire life has been framed by the swings of history in Hong Kong and, looming on its edge, mainland China. He was born in 1928 in the river city of Chaozhou, a place known for its local Chinese opera and embroidery work. When he was a child, the southern Chinese city was a target for Japanese bombing runs. He quit school as a 12-year-old boy and his family fled south down the coast to Hong Kong, then a British colony.
Hong Kong fell to the Japanese in 1941. During that occupation, there were food shortages, malnutrition and disease. Li’s father died from tuberculosis not long after they arrived. His company biography describes what came next: “Before he was 15, Mr. Li had to shoulder the responsibility of providing for his family and found a job in a plastics trading company where he labored 16 hours a day.”
During a 1998 interview with public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong, Li spoke of his mixed feelings when he went back to the mainland in 1978 for the first time in decades. He’d made a fortune in Hong Kong building his way from manufacturing to real estate to finance. The next year, he became the first Hong Kong Chinese investor to take control of one of the British “hongs,” the great trading houses that accompanied colonial rule from the 19th century.
But looking at his motherland, newly emerged from the chaos of Mao Zedong’s rule, Li said he hesitated to invest. “I was afraid that people might say Li had come to exploit,” he said in the interview.
Li’s doubts about mainland control of Hong Kong appear to be longstanding. Britain’s conversation with China about the future handover of Hong Kong began heating up in the 1980s. Even back then, Murray said, Li discussed his anxiety about the financial future of his corporate empire.
Murray said that Li asked him to “go over to the UK and find a nice company for us to put some money in.”
That led to Li buying up a stake of more than 4% in Pearson Plc, a British conglomerate, in an early foray into Western markets that brought wider attention. Murray recalled: “It was on the front page of every bloody newspaper.”
Asked about the tycoon’s concerns at the time, Li’s spokesperson said: “Anyone, especially if one is leading a company with other shareholders, has to have a degree of paranoia as it is part of responsible leadership. The Chinese [have] a traditional saying: 生於憂患，死於安樂, ‘strive in hard times, perish in contentment.’ A certain degree of paranoia prevents the reverse case happening.”
'LIKE A BUDDHA'
After Xi Jinping's visit to Hong Kong in 1993, Li was given the celebrity welcome in Fuzhou, the provincial city Xi then oversaw. The billionaire, who was involved in a redevelopment project there, attended a groundbreaking ceremony with Xi where they laid a foundation stone, according to local media reports.
“It was like a Buddha came to town to build a temple,” said Ruan Yisan, an architecture professor in Shanghai acclaimed for his historical preservation projects who opposed the development. “Officials thought he could do magic here and change the city in a dramatic way.”
At the time, Li had outsized impact in China. In September of 1997, about two months after the handover of Hong Kong, China was on the verge of its largest-ever stock offering, a state-owned telecommunications company preparing to list on the Hong Kong and New York exchanges. At the last minute, a group of Hong Kong tycoons backing the listing of China Telecom got spooked by a financial crisis roiling the region. They said they wanted to renegotiate an agreement that required them to hold their stakes for a year, or drop out completely. It was just weeks before the listing went to market.
Li beckoned a group of Chinese bureaucrats and bankers to his Hong Kong office. He told them that he had signed a contract and would abide by it, according to a banker who was in the room. Then, the Chinese banker said, the billionaire went one step further: He offered to buy a larger stake if necessary. Li helped salvage the deal, which became a template for a flood of state-owned Chinese companies raising billions of dollars through public listings. It was the sort of moment that made Li, with his trademark large black-framed glasses, Hong Kong’s most fabled businessman.
“Mr Li is not a man to break an agreement easily,” the spokesperson for the billionaire said.
Inside China, though, even Li found that the opaque nature of doing business could mean problems, according to those who have worked with him and his own public remarks.
In the public broadcaster interview, Li detailed his frustrations with building Oriental Plaza. A sprawling development in the heart of Beijing, the project faced political wrangling and loud public disagreement about its size as it went up in the 1990s. His Chinese partners, he said, gained a 40% share of the project, up from an initial 10% or so. Li said he had learned a lesson.
“In a political and cultural center like Beijing, one has to put business and economics in a lesser position,” he said. “Although I’ve run into all sorts of trouble, I now have a better understanding of China.”
XI'S MESSAGE
After Xi took power, Beijing adopted a harder line toward Hong Kong. In a 2014 white paper, Beijing said the autonomy the city enjoys was not a given but, instead, contingent on the permission of the central leadership. And Li himself began facing criticism from Chinese state media.
During late 2014 and early 2015, Li folded his Hong Kong-registered Hutchison Whampoa and another company into firms incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Li’s team says the changes were part of a “streamlining and succession plan.”
In September 2015, in the wake of reports of those moves, Li was excoriated by mainland media outlets as insufficiently patriotic. The People’s Daily, the main mouthpiece of the Communist Party, posted a commentary on social media saying that Li was happy to “enjoy the benefits when things are good” but couldn’t be counted on in tough times.
Li released a statement affirming his support of Beijing’s leadership, adding: “The Company, as always, will continue to look for investment opportunities around the world, including mainland China.”
In that period, though, companies under Li’s control were plowing billions of dollars into stakes of firms abroad while pulling back in Hong Kong and on the mainland. That trend hasn’t slowed.
Since 2015, Li’s companies have been involved in acquisitions abroad worth more than $70 billion, in places like Canada, Italy and Australia. In that same period, he participated in just one acquisition in mainland China and Hong Kong worth $500 million or more - an $848 million stake in a Hong Kong-based shipping firm that he purchased with two other investors.
And in those same years, Li divested from four companies in Hong Kong and the mainland, totaling more than $11 billion. Reuters calculated these tallies using figures from Dealogic, a financial data provider, involving deals by Li’s companies worth $500 million or more, including debt.
“We have many projects in China,” Li’s spokesperson said, without disputing the deal figures. Among Hong Kong companies, he added, Li’s group “is the largest investor in the mainland and is thriving in numerous industries.”
Beyond investments, the Communist Party has other demands of Hong Kong’s tycoons. Xi Jinping’s directive was unambiguous at a 2017 meeting between the Chinese leader and the city’s elite, said a senior executive at a major Chinese state-owned enterprise in Hong Kong. Li was in attendance.
“Xi’s message was very clear - that the business community and the tycoons need to uphold social responsibility, and to help the central government maintain the social stability of Hong Kong,” said the executive.
'VERBAL AND TEXT PUNCHES'
That expectation grew more urgent as the protests shook Hong Kong.
Chinese officials have come to think the city’s concentration of wealth is a major source of the discontent, said Allan Zeman, a prominent businessman and economic adviser to Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam. A system of land auctions, which extend back to British rule, allowed a small set of people to corner the market, Zeman said, pushing prices up to a point where no one else could bid. That dynamic leaves housing so expensive that families are crammed into tiny dwellings and upward mobility is limited.
“It made ‘five families’ very, very rich,” said Zeman, referring to the city’s biggest developers.
The developers, Zeman said, now understand. He noted that in September a Hong Kong company, New World Development Co Ltd, announced it was setting aside three million square feet of its land holdings for low-income housing. Asked whether the decision was the result of pressure from Beijing, New World said it hoped “to inspire more people to generate creative approaches to solve Hong Kong’s housing challenge.”
Meanwhile, in early September, China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) gathered executives from the nation’s largest state-owned firms in the nearby mainland city of Shenzhen. According to an executive familiar with the meeting, SASAC officials gave clear marching orders to the Chinese managers: take more control of Hong Kong firms and seek decision-making power within them. SASAC did not respond to questions from Reuters.
When Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, the two sides agreed the city would enjoy a high degree of autonomy under its own governing charter, for half a century. Businesspeople here say that until very recently, 2047 - the date China is set to impose full control - seemed distant.
To be sure, said the head of a private banking operation in the city, most of Hong Kong’s prominent families have been diversifying their personal wealth overseas for many years. The executive works at one of the five largest private banks in the Asia-Pacific region, which handles more than $200 billion in assets.
“For some of these tycoons, 2047 was not a very major consideration,” he said.
That changed as Beijing began to flex its muscles. One event that caught the tycoons’ attention, he said, was the 2017 disappearance of China-born billionaire Xiao Jianhua. Xiao was last seen leaving a luxury Hong Kong hotel in a wheelchair with his head covered, accompanied by unknown men. In its annual human rights report, the U.S. State Department said that “multiple press reports stated he was likely abducted by state security agents from the mainland.”
Xiao’s whereabouts are unknown. No Hong Kong billionaire has suffered a similar fate. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to answer questions about Xiao.
Private bankers say the extradition bill dealt a fresh shock. One financial adviser told Reuters he was involved in a transaction in which a Hong Kong tycoon shifted assets of more than $100 million, between June and August, from a local Citibank account to one in Singapore.
“The extradition bill was the spark, but the fears are much more deeper and broader than that,” the financial adviser said. “I think what we’ve seen is a structural shift away from Hong Kong as a place of relative safety.”
Today, interviews with people who know Li well point to a man anxious about Hong Kong’s future under tighter mainland Chinese rule.
“His attitude to China is one of fear: These guys can take everything I’ve got,” said Murray, his longtime corporate lieutenant, who left the Li group in 2017.
“Simon has his own interpretations but they are not necessarily Mr Li’s,"" the billionaire's spokesperson said, responding to Murray's remarks. ""The central government has reiterated many times that it is committed to openness and reforms.”
Still, as the pressure from Beijing mounts, Li has not humbled himself before the Communist Party.
“When you are my age, you will know how to cut through the noise,” Li said in his letter to Reuters. “I don’t know if it is a concerted effort, but I am getting used to all the unfounded verbal and text punches.”"

The outcome of the election, which will determine how, when and even whether Britain leaves the European Union, remains highly uncertain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives are ahead in opinion polls but three published so far this week have shown their lead narrowing.
Government data showed 3.85 million registrations to vote since parliament agreed on Oct. 29 to hold an election.
The Electoral Reform Society (ERS) said this represented a 31 percent increase on the 2.9 million applications received in the comparable window before the snap election in 2017.
The ERS, a coalition of civil society groups and campaigners, said 67% of registrations were from those aged under 35, slightly lower than the 69% seen in 2017.
It is unclear how many new voters will be added to the electoral roll because many of those who applied will already be registered to vote. The ERS said that based on 2017 data, it estimated 1.4 million applications would turn out to be duplicates."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian data firm AggregateIQ broke privacy laws with some of the work it did for a leading pro-Brexit group in Britain and a number of U.S. political campaigns, according to a report of an official probe released on Tuesday.
Daniel Therrien, the federal privacy commissioner, along with Michael McEvoy, his counterpart in the province of British Columbia, said AggregateIQ (AIQ) had not done enough to ensure it had the authority to disclose British voter data.
""Canadian organizations operating globally... must ensure they understand and comply with their legal responsibilities in Canada, even when they are operating in foreign jurisdictions,"" McEvoy told a news conference.
AIQ was hired in 2016 by Vote Leave, which wanted Britain to leave the European Union, to draw up  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) advertisements aimed at potential voters. AIQ, based in British Columbia, used data gathered online by Vote Leave, which it disclosed to Facebook. 
The privacy commissioners found Vote Leave had not explained to respondents that their information might be shared with Facebook, and AIQ failed to make sure it had the right to use the information. 
""When the company used and disclosed the personal information of Vote Leave supporters to Facebook... it went beyond the purposes for which Vote Leave had consent to use that information,"" the commissioners' report said.
""(This) contravened British Columbia and Canadian privacy laws,"" it added.
The report added that AIQ should make sure it complied with Canadian privacy laws in the future. 
AIQ Chief Operating Officer Jeff Silvester said in an email that the firm had already implemented all of the commissioners' recommendations.
The report expressed similar concerns about lack of consent regarding some of the work AIQ had done on campaigns in the United States for Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
Facebook came under pressure last year after revealing that the personal information of up to 87 million users, mostly in the United States, may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.
In April, Therrien concluded in a separate probe that Facebook committed serious contraventions of privacy law and failed to take responsibility for protecting the personal information of citizens.

Therrien reiterated that he planned to go to court in a bid to force Facebook to correct its privacy practices.

MELILLA (Reuters) - Four migrants have died and up to 16 more are missing after trying to cross into Europe from North Africa on a small raft, Spain's coastguard said on Wednesday.
Rescuers saved 58 people from the raft, which was found drifting around 37 miles off the coast of Morocco on Tuesday night. Three bodies were recovered from the water and another migrant died after being taken to shore, a spokeswoman for the coastguard said.
Sea-borne migration to Europe has dropped sharply since peaking in 2015 but thousands still attempt the dangerous Mediterranean crossing every year, looking to escape poverty and conflict in their home countries. 
The latest group was brought to Spain's North African enclave of Melilla, where a Reuters photographer saw survivors being helped ashore and given medical assistance by the Red Cross. Wrapped in thermal blankets, some of the migrants appeared to be in a state of shock after their ordeal. 
European and Spanish authorities have deployed boats and a plane in the search for a further 16 people who are believed to have been on the raft.
They are also searching for a separate craft carrying 78 migrants that is believed to have set off from Morocco on Tuesday night.
Before Wednesday's deaths, at least 1,136 migrants had already died or gone missing at sea this year after trying to make the crossing, according to the International Organization for Migration. 
Italian authorities saved 149 people from a capsized dinghy off the island of Lampedusa on Sunday. The bodies of five women were retrieved and several others remain unaccounted for. 
Meanwhile Spanish charity ships Open Arms and Aita Mari rescued more than 140 migrants from rafts off the Libyan coast last week and transported them to Italy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two weeks before Efrain Alvarez and his attorneys asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their challenge to a New York City regulation that limited where licensed handgun owners could transport their weapons, police officers showed up at his Bronx apartment and took away all his firearms. 
The officers walked past the bullet-making equipment in his cluttered entranceway and past the trophy deer head hanging on his living room wall. From two imposing steel vaults in the back bedroom, they confiscated around 45 firearms, including five handguns.
""I'm still numb about it,"" the 64-year-old retired city bus driver said of the August 2018 seizure. ""It's my lifelong collection.""
The officers arrested Alvarez, and he was charged with filing a false police report over a claim that one of his handguns had been stolen, a misdemeanor. As a result, Alvarez said, the very handgun license whose transport restrictions he is challenging has been suspended for the second time this decade.
The legal battle over the New York measure is the biggest gun rights case at the Supreme Court since 2010, with the justices set to hear arguments next Monday. The challenge is backed by the National Rifle Association, an influential gun rights lobby group closely aligned with Republicans including President Donald Trump, a fellow New Yorker.
The regulation restricted transport of handguns by licensed owners to shooting ranges within city limits but allowed hunting during designated seasons. The lawsuit claims the measure violated the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
After the regulation was amended in July to allow for transporting handguns outside New York City, city officials unsuccessfully asked the Supreme Court to drop the matter and cancel the arguments, asserting that the case was moot.
The state's NRA affiliate, the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, filed the lawsuit in 2013 with Alvarez and two other gun owners as plaintiffs, after authorities told the men that the regulation prevented them from participating at a shooting competition in New Jersey or bringing their guns to second homes elsewhere in the state.
Alvarez said he joined the suit because he thought it was ridiculous that he could own a handgun but not travel to compete with it. 
In the lawsuit, he and the two other gun owners are described as ""law-abiding residents of New York City."" Alvarez does not think his own legal troubles make it awkward or inappropriate for him to challenge the regulation.
""My suspension has nothing to do with my fight in court,"" Alvarez said in an interview. 
Alvarez also said he accepted a deal last week offered by the Bronx district attorney's office to drop the charge in six months if he is not arrested again. 
Asked about Alvarez's arrest and license suspension, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, Brian Stapleton, said it was the first he had heard of it.
""It has no impact on this case whatsoever,"" Stapleton said.
Describing himself as a supporter of gun control measures like strong background checks, Alvarez said he hopes the ruling in his case does not undermine other firearms restrictions.
""If a bad apple grabs a gun and he does something stupid, it kind of falls on me because I'm part of what's going on. So it would kind of hit a sore spot,"" added Alvarez, who said he admires the NRA but disagrees with some of its policies.
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT
The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court after a lower court found that the regulation did not violate the Second Amendment and advanced the city's interest in protecting public safety.
The Supreme Court in 2008 found for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep a gun in the home for self-defense. In 2010, the court extended that right to state and local laws as well. But the justices have avoided ruling in a major firearms case since then, leaving open questions such as whether that right extends outside the home.
""I hope that they clarify that the right to posses a firearm outside the home is as important and fundamental as the right to possess one inside the home,"" Stapleton said.
Gun control advocates fear that the conservative-majority Supreme Court could use the case to expand gun rights and threaten a wide array of gun control measures nationwide such as expanded background checks and ""red flag"" laws targeting the firearms of people deemed dangerous by the courts. 
""I don't think there's any question that, if given the opportunity, the NRA and its allies will try to re-challenge laws that have already been upheld and certainly challenge any new laws,"" said Eric Tirschwell, managing director of litigation at Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control lobby group that receives funding from Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Born and raised in New York, Alvarez is affable and blunt. He has been a gun enthusiast since serving in the U.S. National Guard decades ago. He said he became an avid hunter and started competitive shooting, winning several awards.
His hobby extends to making bullets, reloading spent casings in a mini-workshop that fills the vestibule of his Bronx apartment. He polishes the casings, melts the lead, pours the molds and sets the bullet heads with a pull of the press. 
Alvarez's August 2018 arrest came after police said he falsely reported a .38 caliber revolver had been stolen by two men he claimed had fooled him by posing as police officers. The saga led police to suspend his handgun license and confiscate his firearms, he said. The New York Police Department declined to discuss Alvarez's case.

""Everybody who owns a firearm in New York City should have the right to take that firearm to his property, and out of the city to go shooting,"" Alvarez's said. ""We're not looking for anything else as far as I'm concerned.""

The United States and Britain expressed concern over reports this month that Mayor Jahongir Artikhojayev told critical local reporters that he could make them disappear or frame them as homosexuals.
The remarks by U.S. and British diplomats amounted to rare public criticism of the tightly controlled ex-Soviet republic that has begun opening up its economy over the past three years.
The dispute, originally between news website Kun.uz and a lower-level municipal official, prompted a prosecutors' inquiry after excerpts from an audio recording of a meeting between the journalists and Artikhojayev were published online.
On Wednesday, the Prosecutor General's office said it found no reason to press criminal charges against the mayor, but asked the government to discipline him for breaching ethics rules.
It also said Kun.uz broke the law by secretly recording the meeting and then not destroying the tape, but once again issued no charges and instead asked the state media watchdog to look into the matter, meaning the outlet was likely to be fined.
Uzbekistan has sought to improve its human rights record since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev took office in late 2016 following the death of longtime autocrat Islam Karimov, but critics of the government still complain of harassment.
Mirziyoyev has not directly commented on the incident but said last week mayors and governors needed to abandon ""old"" approaches when dealing with media. Those who fail to do so and thus damage the country's image will get sacked, he warned.
Senior U.S. State Department official Alice Wells said she was pleased to hear Mirziyoyev ""condemn threats against the media""."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's richest state is set to be ruled by parties opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, jeopardizing a Japanese-backed bullet-train project opposed by farmers.
The BJP's inability to pull together voters in the westerly state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is capital, has meant that three parties, including a former BJP ally, will form the government. That is a major setback for Modi after his landslide victory in general elections this year.
It could also hinder the bullet train project, a $17 billion investment largely financed by a long-term, low-cost loan from Japan. The BJP was in power in both Maharashtra and Gujarat states when work began on project in 2017.
""We have always opposed the bullet train,"" said Manisha Kayande, a spokesperson for the Shiv Sena, a former BJP ally whose leader is now set to head Maharashtra. ""Our state is giving a major chunk of money for the project, when most of the track is in another state. This will definitely be re-framed,"" .
The train will run from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, the main city in Gujarat state, a distance of 508 kilometers (315 miles). But it has run into obstacles acquiring land amid opposition from fruit farmers.
Any delay of the project is likely to undermine investor confidence, at a time when growth has slowed to its weakest pace in years.
Critics say India does not need the high-speed train and investment should go instead to improve the existing network.
""We are not against development or infrastructure projects, but at the same time farmers' interests can't be ignored. We will rethink about projects that farmers are opposing,"" said a senior leader of Nationalist Congress Party, which is a part of the coalition government.
National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRCL), the government agency overseeing the project, had no immediate comment.
The authorities have acquired 548 hectares land out of the total requirement 1,380 hectares and the project was targeted to be operational by 2023 , the government told parliament in July.
Protests against land acquisitions are common in India, where tens of millions of farmers till small holdings. A planned $44 billion refinery to be run by a consortium including Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, is also struggling to secure land in Maharashtra."

One of the highest-profile solidarity strikes forced Finland's national airline Finnair to cancel around 300 flights between Sunday and Tuesday.
But chief labor conciliator Vuokko Piekkala - whose position is nominated by the government every four years to solve disputes - said a resolution was found on Wednesday to settle the wage dispute at Posti.
""Both parties have accepted my proposal for a settlement,"" she said, referring to employee and employer representatives, who accepted, among other conditions, that pay rises will not exceed a level to be defined at later negotiations.
Posti, where 10,000 of its 15,600 employees had gone on strike halting all paper mail, confirmed its operations would return to normal as soon as possible.
""We are ready for both the Black Friday and Christman season online shopping,"" Posti's head of emergencies Jarmo Ainasoja said in a statement.
The mail service has been struggling to cope with falling volume and profitability.
Other disputes, however, are far from over in the Nordic eurozone member where wages and working conditions are mostly bargained collectively between employee and employer unions at national level and validated for several years.
The Finnish Forest Industries Federation said on Wednesday it would hold a six-day lockout from Dec. 12, closing half of the country's sawmills and plywood factories, aiming to put pressure on unions in halted pay negotiations.
The employer federation's announcement came after industrial workers and two other unions called a three-day strike for Dec. 9-11 which would involve some 100,000 workers and largely stall production at companies such as oil refiner Neste, Nokian Tyres and Outokumpu.
That action is about wages and working hours.
With many key industry contracts expiring soon, more strike announcements could follow suit in the coming months in Finland.
Finland's labor unions have traditionally been strong and in recent years they have been angered by a so-called ""competitivity pact"", which increased working hours by three days a year without a pay rise between 2016 and 2019.
The deal was negotiated in 2015 under the previous center-right government to help Finland's economy recover from recession, but the new center-left government in office since June has proven more favorable to employee concerns.

Trump has welcomed Britain's decision to leave the EU, labeling Europe a trade ""foe"" and questioning the value of the transantlantic defense alliance NATO.
""For the first time in history, there is an American president who is openly against a united Europe. He supports Brexit and prays for the breakup of the Union,"" Tusk told the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit in an interview.
Tusk portrayed Trump as determined to weaken the EU and said this was ""perhaps the most difficult challenge"" for the organization.
Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, is about to complete his five-year mandate as president of the European Council, a role in which he has prepared and chaired regular summits of European leaders.
Though ties between the EU and the United States have been troubled since Trump became president, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sought to re-establish friendlier ties when he visited Brussels in September.
Because of its complex matrix of decision-making, multiple institutions and centers of power, the EU has 28 national leaders and institutional leaders in Brussels.
Tusk is expected to be succeeded by former Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. The new European Commission, the EU executive, will be headed by German conservative Ursula von der Leyen."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Farmers shut down busy parts of Dublin's city center for a second successive day on Wednesday by parking dozens of tractors in the capital to protest against low beef prices and climate change initiatives they say they unfairly target them.
The farmers arrived on tractors from all over the country on Tuesday for a planned protest in a cordoned off area but parked their vehicles in the very center of the city and refused to leave until the country's agriculture minister met them.
Some slept in their vehicles overnight, many parked outside the five-star luxury Shelbourne Hotel on the corner of St. Stephen's Green, one of the main bus route into the city.
Police warned commuters that a number of the city's main thoroughfares, including Kildare Street, the seat of parliament, remained closed to traffic. The city's bus operator told passengers to expect delays on all routes.
""We'll sit here for many more nights if we have to but this has got to stop and we have to start getting paid for our produce,” said Nicholas Hughes, a 53-year-old dairy farmer from Moylough in County Galway who sat in his tractor all night without sleep.
""It's the only thing we can do, we're gone if we don't do this. We can't stay producing food below the cost of production and we can't keep getting blamed for climate change. This is about the death of rural Ireland, it's dying on its feet as we speak.""
The protest was similar to one staged on Wednesday by French farmers in Paris, although the events were not coordinated.
A weeks-long dispute between Irish farmers and processors over beef prices cut production and caused a wave of temporary layoffs earlier this year before a tentative agreement brokered by the government lifted pickets at meat factories by a grassroots group of farmers.
Some of the farmers protesting on Wednesday also complained about climate change measures, including plans for rolling carbon tax increases. Hughes said sentiment on the issue in Ireland amounted to ""nothing but farmer bashing.""
Agriculture Minister Michael Creed said he met with demonstrators on the street and inside his office, and that he hoped that could clear the blockage in the city. Protesters said they wanted him to sit down with a delegation from the group.
While some protesters returned to their farms after the first day of protest on Tuesday night, those that stayed said replacements were on the way to maintain the blockade."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police said they would enter Polytechnic University on Thursday, bringing their near two-week siege of the campus to an end, after final searches for any pro-democracy protesters still hiding turned up empty.
For a second day on Wednesday security teams from the university scoured the maze of buildings at the campus, a focal point in recent weeks of the citywide protests that first erupted in June, but no one was found.
""As the school has completed the search, the police security team will enter Polytechnic University tomorrow, as we need to process dangerous items and collect evidence,"" District Commander Ho Yun-sing told reporters.
Any remaining protesters would be given medical treatment, he said.
The red-brick university on Kowloon peninsula was turned into a battleground in mid-November, when protesters barricaded themselves inside and clashed with riot police in a hail of petrol bombs, water cannon and tear gas. About 1,100 people were arrested last week, some while trying to escape.
Riot police sealed off the campus, setting up high plastic barricades and a fence on the perimeter.
The number of protesters has dwindled dramatically, with some managing to flee and others brought out. A lone woman found on Tuesday was ""physically weak and emotionally unstable"", according to a statement from the university.
The university on Wednesday asked government departments for help removing ""dangerous materials"" from the site, which is littered with rotting waste and detritus of the siege, urging authorities to take a ""humane"" approach.
The city's largest pro-establishment party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, urged authorities to send medics to the site to take any remaining protesters to hospital.
LULL IN CLASHES
The Polytechnic University campus was the last of five that protesters had occupied to use as bases from which to disrupt the city, blocking the nearby Cross-Harbour Tunnel linking Kowloon to Hong Kong Island and other arteries.
Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Beijing's meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time.
The protesters had blocked the tunnel's mouth, smashed toll booths, lit fires and cemented bricks to the road, but it was reopened early on Wednesday, and Hong Kong television showed a steady flow of vehicles passing through.
Hong Kong authorities hope that a lull in clashes over the weekend during local elections, where pro-democracy candidates scored a landslide victory, can translate into more calm after nearly six months of turmoil.
Hundreds of people are facing potential jail time in connection with the unrest. 
Secretary for Security John Lee said on Wednesday police had arrested more than 5,800 people since June, the numbers increasing exponentially in October and November, and had charged 923.
Smaller scale protests continued on Wednesday, as crowds in the central business district took to the streets around noon.
‘THANKSGIVING PROTEST’
Reuters also reported that China's leaders had set up a crisis command center in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, to deal with protests that have become the biggest populist challenge since China's leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office in Hong Kong called the report ""false"", without elaborating, in a statement posted on its website Tuesday. ""No matter how the situation in Hong Kong changes, the Chinese government's determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests is unwavering,"" it said.
Despite the euphoria among protesters over the electoral victory, in which democracy advocates swept around 86 percent of the 452 district council seats, fresh demonstrations were planned for the weekend, including a march to protest against the use of tear gas on ""children"". 
A ""Thanksgiving"" protest, in appreciation of the U.S Congress passing legislation supporting protesters, is scheduled for Thursday, the date of the U.S. holiday.
The city-wide elections drew a record turnout and were seen as a vote of no-confidence in Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, over her handling of the financial hub's worst crisis in decades.

One Hong Kong newspaper, Sing Pao, published a front-page spread for the second successive day calling for Lam's resignation. ""Hong Kong people had enough, Carrie Lam quit,"" it read.

Anti-Corruption Commission Director General Paulus Noa confirmed on Wednesday that former minister Sakeus Shanghala and Investec Asset Management's former Namibia chief, James Hatuikulipi, had been arrested. He declined further comment.
The arrests follow the detention of the former fisheries minister Bernhard Esau and another former Investec employee on Saturday on the same charges. Both were released a day later after a judge said the arrest warrants were invalid.
Namibians were voting on Wednesday in presidential and parliamentary elections that were seen as a stiff test for the ruling SWAPO party that has ruled the southern African country for three decades of independence.
The fishing scandal involves allegations the former ministers, who both quit this month when media reports of corruption surfaced, had taken bribes in return for awarding horse mackerel quotas to Iceland's Samherji.
Samherji said previously that it had hired a law firm to investigate the allegations.
Esau has denied any wrongdoing. Reuters has not been able to reach Shanghala, Hatuikulipi or Ricardo Gustavo, the other former Investec employee accused, for comment.
South Africa's Investec told Reuters last week that Gustavo and Hatuikulipi had left the bank and that it had no connection to the case. It said its former employees had not used their Investec positions to facilitate the alleged scheme in any way."

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean children are ""constantly in danger"" of sexual abuse and resulting social stigma without any chance to seek legal protection, a Seoul-based rights group said on Wednesday.
Activists with PSCORE, or People for Successful Corean Reunification, interviewed more than 200 young male and female North Koreans who had fled to settle in the affluent, democratic South for a study on child abuse at home, at school and in state facilities such as prison camps and orphanages.
In a 195-page report, ""Inescapable Violence: Child Abuse within North Korea"", the group described sexual abuse as ""institutionalized and widely accepted as a normal part of life"".
""Children are constantly in danger of being sexually harassed, and have no legal recourse available to them,"" the report said.
At school, for instance, teachers are ""most often the perpetrators"" who could physically harass female pupils and openly make lewd comments.
In one instance, a defector in her 20s testified her teacher said during class that one of the students must have ""better stamina for sexual intercourse"" because she had darker skin.
Another defector who said she became a trader at age 14 to make a living said she had struggled to keep men from groping her breasts and buttocks while traveling to markets by buses and trains.
One day she saw a stranger man rape a woman lying next to her at a dark inn room that dozens of people shared due to train failure, but her aunt sleeping nearby forced her to keep quiet to avoid ""inviting trouble"".
Gathering information in North Korea is notoriously difficult, and Reuters was unable to independently verify the defectors' accounts. North Korea has previously rejected criticism over human rights abuses as false accusations aimed at toppling its regime.
Last year, Human Rights Watch also reported ""endemic"" sexual abuse in North Korea based on interviews with some 100 defectors, although it acknowledged its survey was too limited to provide a generalized sample.
PSCORE said the rampant abuses constitute a breach of a U.N. convention on children's rights, to which North Korea is a signatory. U.N. investigators have also criticized human rights violations in North Korea including the use of political prison camps where executions, rape and starvation take place.
""The lack of government response crystallizes the notion that child sexual abuse is tolerated, and results in the rampant social stigmatization that prevents victims from reporting their abuse,"" PSCORE said."

Johnson has repeatedly denied that Britain's National Health Service is on the table in such talks, but Corbyn said he had copies of leaked documents from UK-US Trade and Investment working groups that proved otherwise.
The NHS, much loved in Britain, has become a key fighting ground before an election on Dec. 12, called to try to break the deadlock in parliament over the country's departure from the European Union that has muddied traditional political loyalties.
Corbyn may also be keen to shift the narrative to the NHS and away from criticism on Tuesday over what Britain's chief rabbi said was his failure to stem anti-Semitism in his party that had allowed ""a new poison"" to take root in Labour.
Corbyn, who has argued that Johnson's Conservatives will allow the United States to increase drug prices as part of a post-Brexit trade deal, said he had 451 pages of unredacted documents on talks between the two countries. 
""Perhaps he (Johnson) would like to explain why these documents confirm the U.S. is demanding the NHS is on the table in the trade talks,"" he told a news conference. 

""These uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson's denials in absolute tatters.""

KABUL (Reuters) - The United States and international rights groups urged Afghanistan on Wednesday to immediately free two civil society activists arrested after they reported that hundreds of school children had suffered sexual abuse.
The Guardian newspaper reported earlier this month that a pedophile ring was involved in the abuse of at least 546 boys from six schools in Logar province, south of the capital Kabul.
Mohammad Musa, a leading rights activist who was investigating the case and quoted by the newspaper, was detained by National Directorate of Security (NDS) personnel along with his colleague Ehsanullah Hamidi last week on the way to Kabul.
In a statement, the NDS said the two were moved to a safe location because of threats to their lives. It accused them of admitting during interrogations that they had made up the allegations in order to get asylum in a foreign country.
In an NDS video released on Tuesday, Musa was seen saying that his research was incomplete and he made a mistake - a confession rejected as ""Soviet-style"" by U.S. Ambassador John Bass.
""It's appalling to coerce confessions from civil society activists,"" Bass said in a tweet, calling for both men to be released.
London-based Amnesty International called for the immediate release of Musa and Hamidi and said they were at risk of torture and ill treatment.
""Rather than punishing them for speaking out against these horrific crimes, the authorities should praise them for their work and hold the suspected perpetrators accountable,"" said Samira Hamidi, an Amnesty South Asia campaigner.
President Ashraf Ghani said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the sexual abuse reports and that he had ordered the education ministry to undertake a thorough investigation and report back to him as soon as possible.
He also said he had directed NDS to immediately hand the two rights activists over to the Interior Ministry, though he did not order their release.
The NDS did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
According to the Guardian report, some of the victims have been killed by their families or unknown perpetrators after being identified as victims of sexual abuses.
In a country where half of the population is younger than 15, Afghanistan's 18-year war since the Taliban regime was toppled has arguably hit children the hardest. Some 927 children were killed in the conflict last year, according to UN report.
Children have been used as soldiers by all warring parties in Afghanistan and human rights groups have reported that some have been sexually molested by Afghan military or police personnel, or used as suicide bombers by Taliban insurgents."

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's authoritarian leader Hun Sen has offered to renew friendship with the United States after receiving a letter from President Donald Trump, a turnaround in relations with the country he once accused of conspiring to overthrow him.
A letter dated Nov. 26 from Hun Sen to Trump thanked him for assurances that Washington was not seeking ""regime change"" in Cambodia.
Both countries foreign affairs teams should now work ""to restore trust and confidence, and renew the bond of friendship between our two countries and peoples"", he added in the letter seen by Reuters.
The rapprochement comes after Cambodia, one of China's closest allies in Asia, had threatened to turn its back on both the United States and the European Union (EU) over their criticism of political repression.
Less than four months ago, a Cambodian official said U.S. diplomats should ""pack up and leave"" after a U.S. embassy statement that the 2018 election did not reflect the will of the people.
Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CCP) won all 125 parliamentary seats in the election after the Supreme Court disbanded the main opposition party.
The opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party was accused of plotting to take power with U.S. help, and its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested on treason charges.
Kem Sokha was released from house arrest earlier this month, though the treason charges remain, as the EU moved closer to cutting off preferential trade status over human rights, though a final decision is months away.
Hun Sen's letter followed one from Trump seeking to improve ties but also urging him to put Cambodia back on a democratic path.
The Cambodian leader, in power for more than three decades, acknowledged tumultuous periods in U.S. relations.
""However, I am of the view that we should not become hostage of a few dark chapters in our history,"" he wrote. ""There are so many other beautiful chapters that are worth nourishing for the greater good of both our countries and people.""
Hun Sen referred to U.S. support for nation building after decades of civil war that ended in the 1990s and ""generous market access"".
""I am indeed thankful and truly appreciate these magnanimous gestures,"" the letter read."

The allegations by the self-professed spy Wang Liqiang, reported by Australian media, have rocked Taiwan, after he detailed Chinese efforts to meddle in Taiwan elections and promote Communist Party influence in Hong Kong.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) have seized on the accusations to warn of the threat from China, which considers Taiwan to be sacred Chinese territory to be brought under Beijing's rule by force if necessary.
China has already branded Wang a fraud and said it was nonsense to suggest it was interfering in Taiwan's January presidential and parliamentary elections. On Wednesday, the government doubled down on that criticism with its strongest words so far.
Speaking at a regular news briefing, Zhu Fenglian, spokeswoman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, reiterated that Wang was a fraudster who carried fake travel documents.
""Actually the facts are clear for this 'fraud who become a spy'. This is a totally absurd, loophole-ridden 'screenplay' concocted by anti-China forces,"" she said.
""The DPP authorities and the fraudster have bandied together, wantonly carrying out political manipulation,"" Zhu said.
""Their intention is to create the illusion of the mainland getting involved in the Taiwan regional elections and obtain improper election benefit for themselves.""
Among several allegations leveled, Wang said he had helped guide positive media attention toward certain Taiwanese politicians, including President Tsai's main opponent, Han Kuo-yu of the opposition Kuomintang party, which favors close ties with China.
Han, who has said he would drop out of the election if he had taken any money from the Communist Party, said on Tuesday he would sue Wang if he ever came to Taiwan.
Tsai wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page late on Tuesday that Chinese interference in Taiwan was happening all the time and could not be denied.
""China's involvement in Taiwan's elections and infiltration of Taiwan society is something that is happening all the time. My opponent should be aware of this,"" she wrote.
""Each of us has a responsibility to stand up and defend the democracy and freedom that belongs to Taiwan."""

The artifacts were bought in good faith by the National Gallery of Australia from a New York-based art dealer who is currently under investigation, the Prime Minister's office said in a statement. Morrison is due to visit India in January.
After extensive research, the gallery had decided to return the items: a pair of door guardians from the 15th century, from Tamil Nadu; and a sculpture of the serpent king, from Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh, made in the sixth to eighth centuries.
""Like India, we understand the value of our ancient cultures and artifacts,"" Morrison said. ""The return of these artifacts is the right thing to do. This is another demonstration of deep relationship between Australia and India.""
Both India and Australia are party to the UNESCO 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transport of Ownership of Cultural Property.
The move comes amid growing calls for repatriation of cultural artifacts from foreign museums, those looted as well as those taken with official sanction in previous times.
Athens has repeatedly called for the permanent return of the 2,500-year-old sculptures that Britain's Lord Elgin removed from the Acropolis temple in the early nineteenth century, when Greece was under Ottoman Turkish rule.
But the British Museum, custodian of the marbles, has ruled out returning them, saying ""the sculptures are part of everyone's shared heritage and transcend cultural boundaries""."

Video images broadcast on television and other media showed Finance Minister Taro Aso smiling after successfully donning one of the collapsible plastic helmets, and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi wore a broad grin.
""You never know when disaster will strike,"" Tadamori Oshima, the lower house speaker, said at the end of Tuesday's session, wearing one of the white helmets with gray chinstraps that are reminiscent of traditional samurai headgear.
""I want you always to be on alert.""
The drill in parliament's lower house was the second since the kits, stowed under members' seats, were introduced in 2017.
School disaster drills are not unusual in Japan, where earthquakes are common. A quake of magnitude 9.0 in March 2011 caused a massive tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people and triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis.
Despite getting instructions on how to unfold and wear the helmets, at least one parliamentarian put his on back-to-front. Others needed a helping hand.
Some Twitter users called the lawmakers' levity off-key.

""Before protecting themselves, they should protect people's lives,"" complained another.
Others took a lighter view.

The vessel was detected crossing the inter-Korean maritime frontier at around 6:40 a.m. (2140 GMT Tuesday) near a South Korean border island off the west coast, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.
The South Korean military issued a warning and fired shots into the water near the ship to drive it away.
""So far, we confirmed that the ship drifted toward that area due to bad weather and engine trouble, and it's currently on the way back to the North on its own,"" the JCS said in a statement.
It was the second time the South fired warning shots toward a North Korean vessel since President Moon Jae-in took office in May 2017, a military official said. Moon has vowed to re-engage with the reclusive North.
South Korea also fired warning shots in September toward a drifting boat and then sent a navy mechanic to help fix its engine.
Inter-Korean relations have cooled after a flurry of diplomacy, including three summits last year, during which Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to improve ties and revive stalled economic projects.
However, there has been no substantial progress and sanctions aimed at Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs have been tightened.

Farmers unions said members heading to the capital from across France would converge on Avenue Foch, near the Champs Elysees and Arc de Triomphe, later on Wednesday.
""The government is leaving us exposed, let us work,"" one farmer wrote on his tractor. 
The demonstration is being staged by the two main farm unions, which called for a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron to express concerns about government policies they say harm French agriculture.
""We want to warn everyone that if there are no more farmers in France it has a knock on effect on the French economy,"" 29-year-old farmer Alix Heurtaut told Reuters in an interview earlier this week.
Resentment among farmers has been growing at what they call ""agri-bashing"", or criticism of agriculture over issues ranging from pesticide use to animal welfare.
Attacks on livestock farms and butcher's shops by vegan activists have caused particular outrage. Longstanding tensions with environmental associations have meanwhile deepened amid debates about banning the common weedkiller glyphosate and restricting pesticide use near residential areas.
Some farmers blame Macron for rushing to ban glyphosate by 2021, going beyond current European Union policy, although the government has promised exemptions for farms that have no viable alternative.
Macron has also been under pressure from farmers over EU trade deals with Canada and the Mercosur bloc of South American countries, which farming groups say will usher in imports of cheaper agricultural goods produced to lower standards.
A food law passed by Macron's government, which aimed to give farmers a fairer share of profits, has also failed to dispel discontent over modest revenues.
Farm unions are gearing up for negotiations over the next EU budget, which could see agricultural spending trimmed due to Britain's planned exit from the bloc.

France is the largest agricultural producer in the EU and the biggest beneficiary of subsidies under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.

The July 1 attack on the restaurant popular with foreigners in Dhaka's diplomatic area shocked the nation of 160 million and signaled a chilling threat to business, including the vital garment exports sector.
Five militants stormed the Holey Artisan cafe, took diners hostage and killed them over 12 hours. Nine Italians, seven Japanese, an American and an Indian were among the dead. The attackers were also killed in a rescue bid by army commandos.
Khan said the seven men convicted on Wednesday were involved in planning the attack. They belong to the group, Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, that seeks to establish sharia rule in the predominantly Muslim country.

Zarif expressed Iran's willingness to support dialogue between all Afghan parties with the participation of the Afghan government, according to IRNA.
The Taliban have refused to talk to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s government, denouncing it as a U.S. puppet.
Last week, the Taliban released American and Australian university professors held hostage for more than three years, completing a delayed prisoner swap and raising hopes for a revival of peace talks.
Iran also held talks with a delegation from Afghanistan’s Taliban in September, a week after peace talks between the United States and the Islamist insurgents collapsed.
Iran said in December it had been meeting with Taliban representatives with the knowledge of the Afghan government, after reports of U.S.-Taliban talks about a ceasefire and a possible withdrawal of foreign troops."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Tohoku Electric Power said on Wednesday it has won initial regulatory approval to restart a reactor at its Onagawa power plant, more than 8 years after it was damaged in the earthquake and tsunami that caused the Fukushima disaster.
Tohoku Electric said in a statement it has received a first green light from Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority to restart the No. 2 reactor at Onagawa, subject to a public consultation period.
Onagawa was the closest among Japan's nuclear stations to the epicenter of the magnitude-9 quake in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people, as well as causing the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.
The station was swamped by the tsunami, but survived with its cooling system intact, saving its reactors from the threat of meltdowns similar to those that occurred at Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi station to the south.
Further approvals will be required before the restart, along with the consent of local authorities, which is not guaranteed.
The reactor is a boiling water reactor (BWR) with the same basic design as those that melted down in the Fukushima crisis.
The Fukushima disaster led to the eventual shutdown of the country's then-54 operational reactors, which once provided nearly a third of Japan's electricity. All had to relicensed under new standards after the disaster highlighted operational and regulatory failings.
While the approval will be a boost for Japan's resurgent nuclear industry, the sector will still miss a government target of providing at least a fifth of the country's electricity by 2030, an analysis by Reuters showed last year.
Nine reactors have been restarted, all of them pressurized water reactors located far from Tokyo, while the stigma of Fukushima still hangs over use of the older BWR technology.
The issue of nuclear safety in Japan was highlighted again earlier this week when Pope Francis - who met victims of the Fukushima nuclear disaster while in Japan over the weekend - said nuclear energy should not be used until there are ironclad guarantees that it is safe for people and the environment.

Authorities in the region have said it will be a long battle to thwart the jihadist group's ideology, even after Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself by detonating a suicide vest during a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria in October.
Malaysia will remain on guard against threats posed by fighters returning from abroad, online radicalization and possible lone-wolf attacks, home minister Muhyiddin Yassin said at a meeting of ministers from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok.
""We believe that al-Baghdadi's death will open up another chapter in Daesh's terror operation. After losing much of its territory in Syria and Iraq, Daesh is also looking for a new base,"" Muhyiddin was quoted as saying by Malaysian news agency Bernama.
Daesh is the Arabic-language acronym for Islamic State and the name Malaysia commonly uses to refer to the group.
Muhyiddin, whose ministry oversees the police force, said Malaysia had foiled 25 planned attacks by Islamic State in the country and arrested 512 people with suspected links to the group over the past six years.
Malaysia has been on high alert since January 2016, when gunmen allied with Islamic State carried out a series of attacks in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Islamic State also claimed responsibility for a grenade attack on a bar in the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June 2016 that wounded eight people. It was the first such strike on Malaysian soil."

""I think it's a good solution. If the unions accept the proposal, the schools should continue with classes on Friday,"" Plenkovic told reporters.
Thousands of striking primary and secondary school teachers and their supporters demonstrated in the capital Zagreb on Monday to press demands for wage hikes of just over 6%.
Teachers launched a nationwide walkout on Nov. 19 in an
escalation of industrial action that started in early October, saying their roles are undervalued compared with those of other public sector employees.
""This offer is not exactly what the strike was about, but we will let our members vote on it,"" said Branimir Mihalinec from the union of secondary school teachers.
The teachers went on strike saying that the government regulations defining the complexity of the jobs in the public sector are such that the teachers' salaries have for years lagged behind other public sector roles.
Plenkovic said that the government would also work on revision of those regulations next year.
Last month the government said it would raise wages for all public sector employees by 6.12% in 2020."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO is expected to ask a group of ""wise persons"" to help reform the alliance after U.S. President Donald Trump questioned its relevance and French President Emmanuel Macron said it was dying.
At a London summit on Dec. 4 marking NATO's 70th anniversary, leaders of the 29 member states will try to put on a show of unity but face questions about the future of the U.S.-led alliance.
Washington's allies in Europe and Canada are uncertain what to expect from Trump after he criticized Germany at a NATO summit in July 2018 and mulled quitting the alliance before praising it and taking credit for promised reforms.
Since then, Macron has also vented his frustration, over what French diplomats say is NATO's lack of coordination at a political level and a failure to tackle taboo subjects. In Macron's words, NATO is ""experiencing brain death"".
His remarks followed a U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria which prompted Turkey to launch an offensive against YPG militia in northern Syria which it sees as terrorists although they helped Washington defeat Islamic State. Ankara's NATO allies fear the assault will undermine the battle against IS militants.
To address the concerns about NATO's future, the summit is likely to adopt a Franco-German proposal to create a group of respected figures under alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, diplomats said.
The ""wise persons"" would report back in late 2021, when NATO is due to hold its next summit, setting the ground for reform.
""We are trying to channel the electric shock produced (by Macron's comments) to structure a political debate,"" said a senior French diplomat involved in discussions.
The aim is to secure a ""re-balanced transatlantic alliance,"" the diplomat said, with Europe recognizing Washington is carrying too much weight.
The group would probably be small, with a mix of elder statespersons and others who can propose more radical ideas.
As a gesture to Trump, a summit deal is expected for U.S. allies to share more of NATO's running costs and reduce Washington's share of annual funding for NATO headquarters and staff from 2021.
Leaders are also set to meet a U.S. demand that European allies have more NATO battalions, ships and planes ready for combat as deterrence against a potential Russian attack.
WHAT WILL TRUMP SAY?
""Of course no-one knows what Trump will say,"" said a senior European NATO diplomat. ""But now we don't know what Macron or (Turkish President Tayyip) Erdogan will say either.""
The one-day summit at a luxury golf club will be unusually brief to reduce the scope for diplomatic disputes though Britain is eager to host the showcase event as it prepares to leave the European Union.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 to confront the threat of the communist Soviet Union but found renewed renewed purpose after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.
NATO is now under pressure to help solve some of the world's most intractable crises and Washington has pushed it to consider its position on China, a growing military power.
""The strain on the system is big,"" Norwegian Lieutenant-Colonel Stein Grongstad told Reuters during training of Norwegian soldiers who will help train local government troops in Iraq under a NATO flag.
""It is difficult for the army to do territorial defense, training and international operations at the same time.""
This is sensitive for Germany, which is Europe's biggest economy but has struggled with outdated weaponry and does not aim to meet NATO's minimum spending target for individual nations until 2031.
""But the question is still whether politicians are ready to spend so much money,"" a German defense source told Reuters."

More than 50 bases used by security forces were attacked and approximately 70 gas stations were also burned, he said, without specifying where the attacks took place.
According to IRNA, Rahmani Fazli also said up to 200,000 people took part nationwide in the unrest that began on Nov. 15 after the announcement of gasoline price hikes.
London-based Amnesty International said on Monday it had recorded at least 143 protesters killed in the protests, the worst anti-government unrest in Iran since authorities put down the ""Green Revolution"" demonstrations against election fraud in 2009.
Iran has rejected Amnesty's death toll. It says several people, including members of the security forces, were killed and more than 1,000 people arrested. The Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group, said the number of arrests was probably closer to 4,000.
The protests quickly turned political, with protesters calling on top leaders to step down. The government has blamed ""thugs"" linked to exiles and the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia for stirring up the street unrest.
The protests came as new U.S. sanctions imposed this year cut off nearly all of Iran's oil exports, and as similar protest movements erupted in Iraq and Lebanon against governments that include heavily armed pro-Iran factions."

The series of protests began last week with a 250,000-person march and a nationwide strike.
Demonstrators are rallying against economic plans - like a rise in the pension age and a cut to the minimum wage for young people - that President Ivan Duque denies supporting, as well what they say is a lack of government action to stop corruption and the murder of hundreds of human rights activists.
Marches have attracted thousands of peaceful demonstrators, but Thursday and Friday were also marked by the destruction of mass transit stations, curfews in Cali and Bogota and the deaths of three people in connection with alleged looting.
Saturday's marches took a dark turn when 18-year-old protester Dilan Cruz was fatally injured by a tear gas canister fired by the ESMAD riot police.
Cruz died on Monday and has become a symbol for protesters, who allege the ESMAD are using excessive force in their crowd dispersion efforts.
The National Strike Committee, comprised of major unions and student organizations, is demanding the government dissolve the force and ""purify"" the police.
Talks between the committee and the government have stalled amid union demands Duque meet with them without the presence of business leaders or other groups.
The committee has also demanded a rejection of the government's tax reform proposal, which includes a cut in business duties.
Duque announced several changes to the proposal this week at the cost of some $930 million - including the return of value added tax to the poorest 20% of Colombians and lower contributions to healthcare by minimum wage pensioners.
Meanwhile, his promise to hold a social issues-focused national dialogue through March has sparked derision among marchers and opposition politicians, who see it as a tepid response to growing discontent.
Duque's administration has been plagued by problems during his nearly 16 months in office, including a combative congress, low approval ratings and unsuccessful legislative efforts."

The bodies of 16 victims arrived in the Southeast Asian country in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Vietnam's foreign ministry said in a statement.
""After waiting for so many days, my son has finally arrived,"" Nguyen Dinh Gia, father of victim Nguyen Dinh Luong, told Reuters.
Under grey and rainy skies, a parade of ambulances snaked through crowds of mourners in the rural town of Dien Chau, Nghe An province, from which some of the victims began the doomed journey.
Five of the 16 bodies would be returned to Nghe An on Wednesday, an official there said.
""We are deeply saddened, but we have to hold back the emotion to organize the funeral for my son,"" Gia said by phone from neighboring Ha Tinh province, where another 10 victims were from.
Cloth-wrapped coffins arrived at Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport early on Wednesday and were loaded into the back of a fleet of waiting ambulances, state media showed.
The bodies would be taken to the homes of their next of kin in Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh provinces, the foreign ministry said.
Vietnamese and British authorities continued to coordinate to repatriate the remaining bodies, it added without giving further details.
Police in Vietnam have arrested 10 people in connection with the deaths. On Monday, the British driver of the truck admitted plotting to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property.
FAMILIES ASKED TO PAY
The grisly discovery last month on an industrial estate near London, a magnet for Vietnamese migrants, has shone a spotlight on the people-smuggling trade bringing the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.
In Vietnam, poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial rewards are all factors pushing people to leave.
Even though the cost of getting to Europe can run into thousands of dollars for migrants ready to pay for a so-called ""VIP"" service, they believe they can make enough money to justify the risk.
Families of the victims, all aged between 15 and 44, have been plagued by confusion and anguish over how to get the bodies home.
The families would have to pay for the repatriation of the bodies, costing up to 2,208 pounds ($2,830) each, according to a foreign ministry statement seen by Reuters.

The Nov. 14 statement said the Vietnamese government would advance the payment, which families could repay later.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 01:07AM ET</span>",Namibians vote in tight contest clouded by economic crisis,"WINDHOEK (Reuters) - Namibians voted on Wednesday in what was expected to be the toughest contest yet for the party that has ruled for three decades of independence, an election it was still expected to win despite a brutal economic crisis.
President Hage Geingob, Namibia's third leader since the sparsely populated and mostly arid country freed itself from the shackles of apartheid South Africa in 1990, is seeking a second and final term from 1.3 million registered voters.
He faces nine challengers including Panduleni Itula, a dentist-turned-politician who is a member of the ruling SWAPO party but is running as an independent. Itula is popular with young people, nearly half of whom are unemployed.
Concurrent legislative polls will elect 96 members of parliament, testing SWAPO's 77-seat majority. Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).
Results are expected within 48 hours.
A sputtering economy, one of Namibia's worst-ever droughts and the biggest corruption scandal in its history have conspired to make this election unexpectedly tough for Geingob, who won by 87% last time.
The economy has been stuck in a recession for the past two years, marred by a drought that ravaged agricultural export crops, as well as by unprofitably low prices for Namibia's main hard commodities, uranium and diamonds.
The Bank of Namibia expects the domestic economy to contract for a third year in 2019, by 1.7%.
A scandal in which two ministers were alleged to have conspired to dole out fishing licenses to Iceland's biggest fishing firm, Samherji, in return for kickbacks has also taken the shine off the ruling party.
Whether the result is close or not, a SWAPO win is likely to be controversial, especially since the court threw out a case mounted by the opposition against the use of electronic voting machines it fears will be used to cheat.
The military said in a statement it was on high alert for violence, which Namibia has avoided in previous polls."

No students or staff members were injured in the incident outside the Sarah J. Anderson Elementary School, the Clark County Sheriff's Office and Vancouver school authorities said.
The shootings took place around 3:15 p.m. PST when a man walked up to a parked car and shot through the window, Clark County Sheriff's Office Sergeant Brent Waddell told reporters.
Police got a description of the suspect and his vehicle and took pursuit. The suspect later stopped and got out, Waddell said.
""When he was challenged by deputies, he actually put a gun to his head and shot himself,"" Waddell said.
Waddell declined to comment on the condition of the victims or the suspect, saying only that all three had been taken to a hospital.
There was a restraining order between the suspect and one of the victims and the suspect was released from jail a few days ago, Waddell said.
Two children were in the car at the time of the shooting and were taken inside the school physically unhurt, he said. Another child connected with the victims was inside the school during the incident.

""As part of our long-standing strategic partnership with Egypt, we continue to raise the fundamental importance of respect for human rights, universal freedoms, and the need for a robust civil society,"" Pompeo said in a news conference.
Rights activists say Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has overseen an unprecedented crackdown on freedoms in Egypt since he took power in 2014. Sisi and his backers say the measures are needed to keep Egypt stable and to counter threats from Islamist militants.
Mada Masr is one of Egypt's last independent news outlets publishing critical stories after years of tightening controls on media and arrests of journalists and bloggers. Its website, which carries stories in Arabic and English, is blocked in Egypt.
On Sunday, Mada Masr said Egyptian security forces raided its offices and briefly detained three of its staff, including its top editor, and confiscated their laptops and phones. All three were later released from a local police station, it said.
Last month, the U.N. human rights office called on Egypt to free a prominent blogger, a lawyer and a journalist, all of whom it said were mistreated in custody.
They are among several thousand people who activists say have been detained following rare protests against Sisi in Cairo and other cities in September.

Von der Leyen needs a simple majority among lawmakers in the 751-member European Parliament for her team to start work on Dec. 1 dealing with a daunting array of challenges including climate change, economic reform and migration.
The new executive had been due to take office on Nov. 1 but the politically fragmented European Parliament rejected three of the nominees, forcing a delay. The executive comprises one commissioner from each EU member state, though Britain, which is due to exit the bloc, has declined to name a representative.
Failure to win Wednesday's vote in Strasbourg would further delay the start of her five-year term and extend the current transitional vacuum in EU policy-making at a time of trade tensions with Donald Trump's United States and an increasingly powerful China.
Von der Leyen, 61, a former German defense minister and close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, will be the first woman ever to hold the EU's top job.
She has listed among her priorities healing EU divisions over migration, stepping up the fight against climate change, tackling gender inequality and equipping Europe better for the digital era.
Building consensus among fractious member states on the politically sensitive issue of the EU's next long-term budget from 2021 will be another major challenge for von der Leyen and her team.
The Commission proposes laws for the EU on everything from budgets to energy, negotiates trade deals around the world on behalf of the EU's 500 million citizens and acts as the bloc's competition watchdog, approving company mergers and setting rules for global tech giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
The new executive may face legal challenges next year due to Brexit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to finally take Britain out of the EU on January 31 if his Conservative Party wins a parliamentary majority in a Dec. 12 election.
As Britain currently remains an EU member after several delays to its departure, it is legally required to have a commissioner in Brussels. Its refusal to name one could expose the new Commission's decisions to legal risks."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Tuesday invited President Donald Trump to its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Dec. 4, starting a new phase of the inquiry that could lead to formal charges against the president within weeks. 
Trump is not required to attend the hearing. But the move allows the president and his legal team access to congressional impeachment procedures that he and other Republicans have denounced as unfair, partly because the White House has not been able to call or cross-examine witnesses. 
The House Intelligence Committee, which has led the impeachment investigation through weeks of closed-door testimony and televised hearings, is expected to release a formal evidence report shortly after lawmakers return to Congress on Dec. 3 from their Thanksgiving recess.
The Judiciary panel will use the report to consider formal charges that it could recommend for a full House vote by mid-December. It gave Trump until 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) on Sunday to advise the committee on whether he would attend the hearing, and to indicate by then who would be his counsel.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, the Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, told Trump in a letter that he was reminding the president that the committee's rules allow him to attend the hearing and for his legal team to question witnesses.
The hearing, scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT), will have legal experts, who have not yet been identified, as witnesses.
""The president has a choice to make: he can take this opportunity to be represented in the impeachment hearings, or he can stop complaining about the process,"" Nadler said in a statement. ""I hope that he chooses to participate.""
In his letter, Nadler said the hearing was intended as an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis of impeachment, as well as the meaning of terms like ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""
""We will also discuss whether your alleged actions warrant the House's exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment,"" Nadler wrote.
Trump denies wrongdoing and has dismissed the inquiry as a sham by Democrats who want to overturn the result of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney tweeted that Democrats ""have decided to give @realDonaldTrump the right to question liberal law professors, but not any fact witnesses. At all."" 
YEAR-END TIMETABLE
The Democratic-led House is aiming to resolve the question of Trump's impeachment before the end of the year, possibly by approving formal charges known as articles of impeachment and forwarding them to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial that could begin in January. 
A trial would determine whether Trump should be convicted and removed from office. But Senate Republicans have shown little inclination to remove Trump, their party's leader, who is seeking re-election in 2020. 
The inquiry centers on a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden as well as a discredited conspiracy theory promoted by Trump that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
Joe Biden is now a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Hunter Biden had worked for a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama.
Democrats have accused Trump of abusing his power by withholding $391 million in security aid to put pressure on a vulnerable U.S. ally to interfere in an American election by digging up dirt on his domestic political opponents.
On Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee released transcripts of closed-door testimony from Mark Sandy, a career official with the White House Office of Management and Budget, and Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. 
In his testimony, Sandy, one of the only current White House aides to agree to testify to congressional investigators, said a budget office attorney and another staffer in that office resigned partly because of concerns over the hold on U.S. military aid to Ukraine.
Reeker in his testimony discussed the ""irregular"" role three officials close to Trump - the ambassador to the European Union and Trump donor Gordon Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani - played in U.S. policy toward Ukraine.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday found support for impeaching Trump tracked higher over the past few weeks of televised impeachment hearings. According to the poll, which split largely along party lines, 47% of respondents believed Trump should be impeached and 40% were opposed.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian police on Tuesday arrested four volunteer firefighters accused of intentionally setting fires in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, but civic leaders said the arrests amounted to government harassment of environmental groups.
The four firefighters operated in Alter do Chao region of the northern Amazonian state of Para, where a rash of blazes struck earlier this year. Police said the arson was aimed at generating donations to the volunteer fire force.
Making the arrests ""was an act of aggression,"" congressman Airton Faleiro told reporters at a press briefing in Brasilia organized by the environmental caucus.
Faleiro said the government was seeking to blame the fires on nongovernmental organizations rather than on land grabbers, who environmentalists say set blazes to illegally clear virgin land for farming and ranching.
The number of fires in Brazil's Amazon spiked in August, sparking global outcry that the country was not doing enough to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest. Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro at one point suggested NGOs were to blame for setting the fires.
Civil police for Para said in a statement that they arrested the four members of the Alter do Chao Fire Brigade as a preventative measure amid an ongoing investigation into the causes of the fires.
Police said the firemen had ""privileged information and images of the fires"" that were suspicious.
""They filmed, published and then were called on by the government to help control the same fires that they caused,"" Jose Humberto Melo Jr., an officer involved in the raid, said in a written statement.
""They always claimed to be surprised upon arriving at the scene, but there was no other logical possibility.""
Police said the images were used to defraud donors, including one who gave 300,000 reais ($71,489.85) to the group.
The firefighters and their legal representative could not immediately be reached for comment.
Police also raided a nongovernmental organization called the Health and Happiness Project that is closely associated with fire prevention efforts.
""I personally know the firefighters. They were always trustworthy and of good character,"" said Caetano Scannavino, coordinator of the Health and Happiness Project. ""This is a joke.""
Scannavino said the police carried out the raids on his NGO without a judge's order or explanation of the allegations. ""They took everything,"" he said.
Greenpeace condemned the arrests as ""an attempt to criminalize social movements and NGOs that work to preserve the Amazon."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Public support for impeaching President Donald Trump has tracked steadily higher over the past few weeks while a U.S. House of Representatives committee held a series of televised impeachment hearings, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.
The latest poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday, found that 47% of adults in the United States felt Trump ""should be impeached,"" while 40% said he should not. 
The result, combined with Reuters/Ipsos polling over the past several weeks, showed that the number of Americans who want to impeach the president increasingly outnumbers those who do not. 
Just before the hearings started on Nov. 13, the Reuters/Ipsos poll found that ""net support"" for impeachment, which is the difference between the number who support impeachment and the number who oppose, was 3 percentage points. 
That increased to 4 points after the first week of hearings, and then to 5 points as the second week of hearings started. The latest poll shows that net support for impeachment is now at 7 points.
The inquiry centers on a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden as well as a discredited conspiracy theory promoted by Trump that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Democrats have accused Trump of abusing his power by withholding $391 million in security aid to put pressure on a vulnerable U.S. ally to interfere in an American election by digging up dirt on his domestic political opponents.
If articles of impeachment are approved by the Democratic-controlled House, the Senate, controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, would hold a trial on whether to convict Trump and remove him from office. Republicans have shown little inclination toward removing Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020.
Trump denies wrongdoing and has dismissed the inquiry as a hoax or effort by Democrats to overturn the result of the 2016 election.
PARTY LINES
Public opinion about impeachment remains split along party lines, with about eight in 10 Democrats supportive of impeaching Trump, and eight in 10 Republicans opposed. 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that seven in 10 Republicans believed the House inquiry had not been conducted fairly, and most Republicans opposed impeachment for anything short of outright lawbreaking by the president.
Four in 10 Republicans agreed that a president who uses his powers for financial gain should face an impeachment inquiry, while three in 10 said it would be justified for a president who obstructs justice or harms U.S. interests abroad. 
Only two in 10 said an inquiry would be justified for a president who uses his powers for unfair political advantage over an opponent, as Trump is accused of doing.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,118 adults, including 528 Democrats, 394 Republicans and 111 independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points.

""They will be designated ... I have been working on that for the last 90 days. You know, designation is not that easy, you have to go through a process, and we are well into that process,"" Trump said in an interview with conservative media personality Bill O'Reilly that aired on Tuesday.
Once a group is designated as a terrorist organization, under U.S. law it is illegal for people in the United States to knowingly offer support and its members cannot enter the country and may be deported. Financial institutions that become aware they have funds connected to the group must block the money and alert the U.S. Treasury Department.
Mexico's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mexico's foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said on Monday he did not expect the United States to make such a move. 
Earlier this month, Trump, in a tweet, offered to help Mexico ""wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.""
The proposal came after nine Americans were killed in an ambush in northern Mexico. 
Mexican authorities said they may have been victims of mistaken identity amid confrontations among drug gangs in the area.

But the LeBaron extended family, members of a breakaway Mormon community that settled in northern Mexico decades ago, has often been in conflict with drug traffickers in Chihuahua and victims' relatives said the killers must have known who they were targeting.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 06:51PM ET</span>",Pennsylvania revamps child sex abuse laws,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Pennsylvania's governor on Tuesday signed legislation to eliminate the filing deadline for child sexual abuse prosecutions, giving victims more time to file lawsuits for damages, after major abuse scandals in recent years.
Other parts of the three-bill package make public schools and the government subject for the first time to civil lawsuits by sexual abuse victims, increase penalties on ""mandated reporters"" who fail to report abuse to the police, and specify that non-disclosure agreements cannot prevent a victim from talking to the police.
""These bills will today become law, and victims of one of the most unimaginable forms of abuse will receive the rights and support they deserve,"" Wolf said in a statement.
The legislature, however, rejected a measure sought by victims and their advocates to provide a two-year window for victims who had missed the old civil filing deadline to seek damages. The proposed measure will be placed before state voters as a constitutional amendment, a process that could take years.
The state was rocked by the conviction in 2012 of Jerry Sandusky, a beloved former assistant football coach at Pennsylvania State University, for sexually abusing 10 boys over 13 years. In 2018, a state grand jury report accused 301 Catholic priests of abusing more than 1,000 children across the state.
Other alleged victims of Sandusky and many alleged victims of the priests did not get their day in court because of the criminal prosecution deadline which has now been eliminated. The new law also extends the civil filing deadline for victims abused before the age of 18 to age 50 from 30.
Marci Hamilton, a spokesman for ChildUSA, a Philadelphia nonprofit that tracks child sexual abuse laws across the country, said the governor's action moves Pennsylvania from the bottom of the pack to ""about in the middle.""
""We definitely did not get everything we wanted,"" she said.
Her organization seeks to end filing deadlines for both criminal and civil cases regarding child and youth (aged 18-24) sexual abuse. She ranked Delaware at the top of the states for eliminating both."
1490,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 06:45PM ET</span>","No money, no hope: South Korea's 'Dirt Spoons' turn against Moon","By Hayoung Choi and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hwang Hyeon-dong lives in a 6.6-square-metre (71-square-foot) cubicle near his university campus in Seoul, which comes with a shared bathroom and kitchen plus all the rice he can eat, that he rents for 350,000 won ($302) a month.
The sparse rooms, in premises called goshi-won, were previously mostly used by less well-off students to temporarily cut off from the outside world while they studied for civil service job tests.
Now they are increasingly becoming permanent homes to young people like Hwang, who identifies himself among the ""dirt spoons"", those born to low-income families who have all but given up on social mobility.
""If I try hard enough and get a good job, will I ever be able to afford a house?"" said the 25-year-old, who lives in his small, cluttered room where clothes were piled on the bed. ""Will I ever be able to narrow the gap that's already so big?""
The concept of dirt spoons and gold spoons, as those from better-off families are known, have been around for many years but exploded onto the political scene in recent years, undercutting support for liberal President Moon Jae-in.
Moon came to power in 2017 on a platform of social and economic justice. Yet halfway through his five-year term, he has little progress to show the country's youth who have borne the brunt of deepening inequality.
Income disparity has instead widened since Moon took office, with the top income bracket now earning 5.5 times the bottom one, compared with 4.9 times before his inauguration, official data shows.
Hwang, who is in his third year majoring in media studies, said a corruption scandal surrounding former Justice Minister Cho Kuk was a wakeup call for dirt spoons like himself who may have once believed that hard work will make a difference.
Cho and his college professor wife were accused of using their positions to help their daughter gain admission to medical school in 2015.
Cho acknowledged he was a gold spoon and a ""Gangnam liberal"" motivated by social justice, but the approach backfired and he stepped down in October after only a month in the post. His wife is facing trial on allegations of forgery and financial fraud.
CUP RICE MEALS
To many struggling youth, the scandal - which fuelled some of the largest protests of Moon's term - showed how gold spoons get further ahead with the help of their parents' status and wealth.
In a September poll of 3,289 people by recruiting service provider Saramin, three-quarters of respondents said parents' background was key to children's success.
""I can't complain that we have different starting lines,"" said Kim Jae-hoon, 26, who also lives in a goshi-won cubicle.
""But it makes me angry that there are people who are getting help improperly. It's OK that someone was studying when I had to be working, but the fact that they are getting improper help makes me angry.""
Kim works as a part-time waiter at a bar near his school and gets by on 400,000 won a month for rent, food and allowances.
Most meals are ""cup rice"" he prepares in the shared kitchen, menial fare of rice and basic toppings - eggs, half an onion and sauce.
Young, low-income voters like Kim have deserted Moon in record numbers.
Support among voters aged 19 to 29 dropped from 90% in June 2017 to 44% by October, according to a poll by Gallup Korea, while support among those considered on low-incomes has fallen 44 percentage points fall since mid-2017.
""President Moon's been talking about equal opportunity, a level-playing field and justice. But, I feel a sense of betrayal because the current situation is far different from what he promised,"" said Hwang, who voted for Moon.
Older workers are also feeling the pinch as Moon tries to improve employment opportunities and social justice for young workers.
In a televised town hall meeting last week, Moon conceded he had fallen short on those promises and said his declining support among youth was proof he had let them down.
POPULAR CULTURE
The idea of dirt spoons and gold spoons has resonated in popular culture in recent years.
The film ""Parasite"" directed by Bong Joon Ho about two families at the opposite ends of the social spectrum has been a smash hit at home and abroad, winning the Cannes Palme d'Or and touted as an Oscar ""Best Picture"" contender.
A popular fantasy digital cartoon called ""Golden Spoon"" features a poor boy swapping his family with his rich friend's by eating with a magic gold spoon is set to be serialized as a TV drama.
Even the hit boyband BTS, known as a ""dirt spoon idol"" for their early struggles, tackles the social divide, singing ""Don't call me a spoon! I am just a human"" in the song ""Fire"".
Gold spoons are now a hot gift item, replacing gold rings traditionally given to children on their first birthdays, wishing them a wealthy life.
The fact that gold and dirt spoons are portrayed in popular culture in such a diverse range is reflective of the bitter hopelessness among the have-nots, said Kim Jong-min, the leader of civic group Youth Taeil, which supports young jobseekers and temporary workers.
""But, powerful people in the Moon government and the ruling party - they portray themselves as reformists, but they are just the same old politicians that are not listening to the suffering of the low-income class,"" he said.

Victor Mones Coro, founder of Florida-based American Charter Services (ACS), had been charged in March by federal prosecutors in the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, along with El Aissami, for violating Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act sanctions imposed by the United States in 2017.
Those charges accused El Aissami, who currently serves as vice president for the economy in socialist President Nicolas Maduro's government, of illegally using services provided by ACS.
Washington recognizes opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's president, arguing Maduro is usurping power after holding sham elections last year.
""Victor Mones Coro has now admitted that he conspired to circumvent U.S. sanctions to help former Venezuelan vice president Tareck El Aissami... obtain international transport via private jet,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement.
ACS, which has not been charged, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Venezuela's information ministry, which responds to media requests on behalf of government officials, did not respond to a request for comment.
Venezuelan officials accuse Washington of seeking to oust Maduro in a coup to take control of the OPEC nation's vast oil resources.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in July added El Aissami to its list of 10 most wanted fugitives.
""Today we have learned of a new, infamous, attempted aggression by the empire,"" El Aissami said then in a video posted to his Twitter account.
""They can accuse us of whatever they want. We will keep building the dream of Bolivar, the dream of the fatherland,"" he added, referring to Latin American independence hero Simon Bolivar."

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations investigators have so far identified 160 Islamic State militants accused of massacres of Yazidis in northern Iraq in 2014 and are building legal cases against them, the head of the team told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. 
The U.N. investigative team, created by the U.N. Security Council, started work a year ago to collect and preserve evidence for future prosecution of acts by Islamic State in Iraq that may be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. 
""In relation to the Yazidi community alone, the crimes that targeted them, we have identified over 160 perpetrators of massacres against the Yazidis ... and we're focusing our work to build solid cases hopefully in relation to each of those that may be presented to domestic courts,"" said Karim Asad Ahmad Khan, head of the U.N. team. 
U.N. experts warned in June 2016 that Islamic State was committing genocide against the Yazidis in Syria and Iraq to destroy the minority religious community through killings, sexual slavery and other crimes.
Islamic State militants consider the Yazidis to be devil-worshippers. The Yazidi faith has elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Islam.
Nadia Murad, who won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney played a key role in pushing for the U.N. investigative team. Murad is a Yazidi woman who was enslaved and raped by Islamic State fighters in 2014.
Islamic State overran the Yazidi faith's heartland of Sinjar in northern Iraq in 2014, forcing young women into servitude as ""wives"" for its fighters and massacring men and older women.
Yazidi survivor Kachi, whose full name was withheld to protect him, addressed the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. 
""After shooting at us, ISIL members left to another place. I found myself under a pile of dead bodies,"" he told the council. ""When I opened my eyes I saw three of my brothers. They were next to me. They were dead. So were my nephews and my cousins.""
He said his wife and daughters were kidnapped and sold as slaves and that he had lost some 75 members of his family.
""Five years have passed and I can still hear my wife and my daughters screaming when the members of ISIL kidnapped them. I can also hear the voice of my daughter Lara, who was three months old when she passed away in captivity because of thirst and hunger,"" Kachi said. 

He said the Yazidis now want justice.

COCHABAMBA, Bolivia (Reuters) - Bolivia may need outside help to probe a ""massive"" amount of human rights violations and post-election violence to ensure findings are seen as credible in the deeply divided South American nation, the head of the region's human rights commission told Reuters on Tuesday. 
After a three-day visit to Bolivia, Paulo Abrão, who heads the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), recommended Bolivia seek help from an international panel of experts similar to one formed to investigate the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico. 
""Normally in these situations...national institutions aren't prepared to resolve such a massive grouping of violations"" of human rights, Abrão said in an interview in Cochabamba, one of the regions hit hardest by recent unrest.
Abrão said he received contradictory accounts of how people died in the upheaval and noted deep distrust of authorities by family members of victims. 
Bolivia spiraled into chaos after its Oct. 20 election was mired in controversy amid allegations it had been rigged in favor of President Evo Morales, who resigned under pressure from security forces and protesters.
Most of the at least 33 fatalities since the vote came after interim President Jeanine Áñez, a former Senator, took office on Nov. 12, and the military deployed against Morales backers who had blocked strategic roads to protest what they viewed as a coup. 
On Monday, Abrão was welcomed by thousands of people chanting ""justice!"" during his visit to the Cochabamba town of Sacaba, where nine people were shot dead in demonstrations against Áñez. 
Abrão visited a roadside memorial for victims and listened to testimony of their family members and the wounded, who described the use of live ammunition by security forces to repress what they said had been a peaceful protest.
""My brother Julio Pinto is in intensive therapy,"" Felix Pinto, an indigenous farmer told Abrão and his team. ""It's as if he's dead right now.""
Áñez' government and the military deny security forces are to blame for the deaths, suggesting instigators killed the protesters to destabilize her government. 
The attorney general has said that bullets found are not a type used by the military or police, but his office has yet to announce an investigation to find those responsible.
Despite ongoing hostilities, both sides have managed to reach a series of deals to pave the way for new elections and wind down road blockades and troops in the streets.
Abrão praised recent talks. ""That's the only path toward a peaceful end to the crisis,"" he said. ""Social pacification is the best environment to protect human rights.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday used the high power of his office to pardon ""Butter,"" a 47 pound (21 kg) turkey, during a U.S. tradition at the White House where he also cracked jokes about Democrats' investigation into whether he should be impeached.
Both Butter and his alternate ""Bread"" escaped the fate of becoming the main course of a Thanksgiving feast and were sent to a special reserve in Virginia. 
Standing at a podium in the Rose Garden, Trump said the birds had been raised to remain calm under ""any condition.""
""Which will be very important because they've already received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff's basement on Thursday,"" he joked, referring to the House of Representatives intelligence committee chairman who has led the inquiry into whether Trump should be impeached for pressing Ukraine to investigate a political rival of his.
""It seems the Democrats are accusing me of being too soft on turkey. But Bread and Butter, I should note, that, unlike previous witnesses, you and I have actually met."" 
While other presidents occasionally gave turkeys commutations starting with Abraham Lincoln, another Republican president, George H. W. Bush, was the first to make sparing one an official act, according to the non-profit Constitution Center. Trump's predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, is credited with starting the tradition of cracking ""dad jokes"" at the pardon.
The threat of impeachment may be looming larger each day, with Democrats expected to release a crucial report after Thanksgiving, but it did not stop the White House from reveling this week in the somewhat goofy pardoning tradition. 
It posted videos of the turkeys checking into a special suite at the Willard Hotel, where political leaders have stayed in the past, and baseball card-like statistics on both Bread and Butter. 
The National Turkey Federation introduced the birds in a press conference on Tuesday. In true Washington fashion, polling decided which turkey would receive the official pardon, with Americans sharing their preference for Butter on Twitter. 

According to the White House, Butter enjoys listening to bagpipes and has a gobble style that is ""rowdy."" Bread prefers Bluegrass music and wants to master aerial yoga.

The sustained boos, which bookended her remarks and were interrupted by some cheers, marked the latest negative reception for President Donald Trump and the first lady at recent public events. The Republican president is seeking re-election in November 2020 as an impeachment inquiry against him heats up in Congress.
Baseball fans booed the Republican president at a World Series game in Washington in October. Days later, he was greeted with a mix of cheers and boos at a Mixed Martial Arts event in New York City. All three cities are heavily Democratic.
The first lady spoke about opioid addiction at the B’More Youth Summit hosted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation, a nonprofit group founded by the actor. 
""Hello, everyone,"" Mrs. Trump said as she tried to talk through sustained boos at the start of her brief remarks.
The jeering subsided, then restarted as she concluded by telling the audience: ""Wishing you all a Happy Thanksgiving. May God bless you, your families and the United States of America.""
Donald Trump has few friends in Baltimore, a city he derided as ""disgusting"" and ""rodent-infested"" over the summer during a war of words with late hometown congressman Elijah Cummings, a harsh critic of Trump's policies. Protests greeted the president during a September visit to the city 40 miles (60 km) north of Washington.

Babacan resigned from the AK Party (AKP) in July, citing ""deep differences"". A founding member of the Islamist-rooted AKP, which has ruled Turkey since 2002, he served as economy and then foreign minister before becoming deputy prime minister, a role he held from 2009 to 2015.
But following a failed military coup in 2016, Erdogan has presided over purges in the civil service, the judiciary, the military and academia that critics say undermine the rule of law and democratic freedoms.
Erdogan also assumed new powers under a constitutional overhaul at the expense of parliament and the government.
""We have seen that Turkey has entered a dark tunnel, with its problems on every issue growing by the day,"" Babacan told broadcaster HaberTurk in his first live interview since resigning from the AKP.
""Consequently we have begun our efforts to create a new party,"" he said.
Babacan largely refrained from directly criticizing Erdogan, but repeatedly said that a lack of democracy under ""one-man rule"" damaged the country.
""There were important principles and values during the foundation of the AK Party, but there has been a significant departure from these principles. This has become a national issue, and we felt a serious responsibility toward our country.""
Babacan, along with Turkey's former president Abdullah Gul, another AKP founder and onetime Erdogan ally, has long been rumored to be planning a rival party.
Babacan said Gul would not be actively involved in the party, but was working as an adviser or ""big brother"".
Former Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu also fell out with Erdogan in 2016 and criticized the AKP's economic policy, but Babacan ruled out Davutoglu joining his new party.
Turkey’s next elections are scheduled for 2023."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France and Germany put aside bilateral tensions on Tuesday to call for an overhaul of the EU, which has been buffeted over the past decade by a euro zone debt crisis, an influx of migrants and refugees, rising eurosceptic populism and Brexit.
Some European Union leaders fear that regional and political rifts could tear apart a project they credit with keeping peace and prosperity on the continent, including in eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
Paris and Berlin, long seen as the axis of the continent's post-World War Two unification process, said a ""Conference on the Future of Europe"" was necessary to make the EU ""more united and sovereign"" across a range of challenges.
These include Europe's role in the world and its security, they said in a document that comes amid growing concern that Europe is ill-equipped to deal with new security and economic challenges, especially from a rising China. 
Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron described the NATO transatlantic military alliance as ""brain dead"", urging Europe to bolster its capacity to act because it cannot rely eternally on an unpredictable United States.
The two-page Franco-German paper said other areas where Europe needed to be more united included its near neighbors, digitalization, climate change, migration, the fight against inequality, the ""social market economy"" and the rule of law.
It said a reflection lasting more than two years should consider reforms that would, among other aims, promote democracy and the functioning of a bloc that will group 27 countries after Britain's expected departure on Jan. 31.
Many EU citizens feel their voices are not heard in Brussels and have little trust in its institutions, sentiments that drove Britain's 2016 referendum vote to leave the bloc.
The EU's two heavyweights said citizens would need to be closely involved in the reflection on Europe's future through a ""bottom-up process"" of consultations.
""BACKROOM DEALS""
They said recommendations agreed at a closing conference in the first half of 2022 should be presented to the European Council of member states' leaders for debate and implementation.
Diplomats said the document sent a message, ahead of an EU summit on Dec. 12-13, that member states must be closely involved in reflections on Europe's future amid institutional jockeying for a leading role.
A new European Commission, the EU's executive, which starts its five-year mandate on Dec. 1, has already proposed a 2020-2022 conference.
Manfred Weber, leader of the center-right European People's Party in the European Parliament, said in an opinion column on Tuesday that it is the role of an assembly directly elected by European citizens to fight for a more democratic Europe.
""There are many in Brussels and other European capitals who prefer to make decisions through quick backroom deals, in which the direct choice of the voters becomes victim to personal power games,"" the German EU lawmaker wrote on Politico.
Many in the bloc's assembly were furious when EU leaders, horse-trading over top posts at a July summit, brushed aside the so-called ""Spitzenkandidaten"", the main parliamentary groups' candidates for the post of European Commission president. 
France and Germany have been at loggerheads over the past year as Macron's ambitious plans for reform have often run into resistance from the more cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Berlin was irked last month that Macron blocked the opening of EU membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania, and Merkel described Macron's brain death comments on NATO as ""drastic words"".

The idea behind the joint proposal on the future of Europe was to show that Franco-German cooperation was not itself brain dead, a French diplomatic source said.

It marks the first major nomination of a member of Fernandez's incoming economic team. Markets are eager to learn who will head key bodies such as the Treasury, central bank and agriculture in the grains exporting powerhouse.
""It is expected that Marco will take charge of INDEC,"" Fernandez said on local television.
Fernandez beat President Mauricio Macri in the October election, after a politically toxic cocktail of recession, high inflation and fallout from unpopular austerity policies hurt the incumbent's image. One of Macri's accomplishments, however, was to improve the credibility of official economic data.
INDEC was notorious under previous President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who led Argentine from 2007 to 2015, for under-reporting inflation statistics. She was Alberto Fernandez's running mate in this year's campaign and will be sworn in as vice president when he takes office on Dec. 10.
Lavagna is the son of former Argentine Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna, who also ran for president this year but whose campaign never gained the traction to seriously challenge Macri."

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The top U.S. general, Mark Milley, arrived in Iraq on Tuesday amid a spate of anti-government protests in the Middle East and questions about how they could impact Iranian influence in the region.
Anti-government protests in Iraq erupted in early October and have grown into the largest demonstrations since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Lebanon has faced five weeks of anti-government protests, fueled by anger at corruption among the sectarian politicians.
As the governments in Iraq and Lebanon struggle with huge waves of popular protest, powerful factions loyal to Iran are pushing to quash political upheaval that challenges Tehran's entrenched influence in both countries.
Some experts believe that protests in the region, including those in Iran itself, could give the United States an opportunity to reduce Tehran's regional influence. But they warn they could hurt American interests as well.
""Everybody looking at popular protests in the Middle East has to keep very much in mind that we rarely have an idea where these are going to go,"" said Jon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""It could displace a number of vital partners as it could displace the Iranians... Ultimately, I don't think you can ever get the Iranians out of Iraq,"" Alterman said.
There are more than 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq supporting local forces, though Iraq has rejected any long-term presence of additional U.S. forces that crossed its border during an American drawdown from northern Syria.
There are also concerns Iran could lash out militarily against U.S. allies in the region to deflect from pressure being built up by protests within Iran.
Iran's clerical rulers have blamed ""thugs"" linked to exiles and foreign foes - the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia - for stirring up unrest that has led to some of the worst violence in the country in a decade.
U.S.-Iran tensions have risen after Sept. 14 strikes on Saudi oil facilities, following attacks on tankers in Gulf waters. Washington has blamed the attacks on Iran, a charge Tehran denies.
""Iran is aggressive in the region against their neighboring states, both overtly and covertly,"" Army General Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters this week.
""So will they continue to do that in the future? I don't know. I would like to say no, but it is certainly possible that they will,"" he added.
BURDEN SHARING
Milley, who is in the Middle East for the first time since taking the chairman job in September, is meeting with allies in the region. He met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday.
The United States has deployed about 3,000 additional military forces to Saudi Arabia in recent months to bolster Saudi defenses, including an air expeditionary wing and air defense personnel.
U.S. and Saudi officials are negotiating burden-sharing arrangements for the American troops in the kingdom, officials said. Riyadh could help pay for things like upgrades to a major air base, fuel and other logistics.

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said last month that Saudi Arabia had agreed to help underwrite the deployment to the kingdom, something Trump has repeatedly called for.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Several thousand Israelis rallied on Tuesday in support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he faces the gravest threat to his political survival after corruption charges and two failed elections. 
Held under the banner ""Stop the Coup"", the protest failed to draw the huge crowds its organizers - members of Netanyahu's Likud party - had hoped to attract and only a handful of the faction's senior lawmakers and cabinet ministers attended. 
Netanyahu was charged on Thursday with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He denies wrongdoing in all three of the criminal cases and has cast the investigations against him as an attempted coup aimed at ousting a popular right-wing leader.
Israeli media put the number of demonstrators at about 2,000 to 3,000 people while Likud said 15,000 attended the rally.
""The legal establishment's goal is to topple an elected prime minister,"" said Ron Nahmani, 70, who had come to the protest. Addressing the crowd, Likud lawmaker Miki Zohar said the justice system was playing a part in a leftist conspiracy. 
Netanyahu's centrist rival Benny Gantz, who heads the Blue and White party said on Twitter: ""In a healthy democracy, a prime minister does not organize a demonstration against the justice system."" 
Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who made the decision to charge Netanyahu, said that attacks on the legal system had gone too far. 
""I'm hearing threats. I'm hearing baseless slander. It's shocking,"" Mandelblit said at a judiciary conference in southern Israel. Two of the lead prosecutors on the Netanyahu investigations have had to have bodyguards assigned to them, he said. 
Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving leader and in power since 2009, presently heads a caretaker government after two inconclusive elections this year. He is not obliged by law to leave office over the charges and has vowed to stay in power.
But the indictment against him, the first of a sitting Israeli premier, has prompted calls from the center-left opposition for him to step down, and has stirred up a leadership challenge from within his Likud party. [L8N2854II] 
Israel is facing unprecedented political turmoil after neither Netanyahu nor Gantz failed to form a coalition government following elections held in April and in September. With the political deadlock unresolved, Israel could be facing a third ballot within a few months.

On Sunday Labour promised to hand 58 billion pounds ($74 billion) of compensation to women who had been expecting to retire at 60 but were then told they would have to wait longer.
The move was not costed in Labour's election manifesto.

Bruno Rodriguez tweeted the U.S. embassy in Havana was engaged in “illegal” activity “intended to attack our constitutional order.”
It was the second time in less than a week that the Communist-run government accused U.S. diplomats of fomenting dissent.
While harsh rhetoric has returned to the old Cold War foes bilateral relations, Cuba has refrained from attacking U.S. diplomats up to now.
Relations, broken off in 1961 and only partially restored in the 1980s, were reestablished as part of a short-lived detente orchestrated by former U.S. President Barack Obama.
President Donald Trump, upon taking office, quickly announced he opposed the warming trend and is demanding Cuba cease its support for the Venezuelan government of socialist Nicolas Maduro and reform its political and economic system.
“They violate the Vienna Convention, the agreement for the reestablishment of relations and Cuban and U.S. laws,” Rodriguez wrote, without providing specifics.
The U.S. embassy did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Last week an editorial in the Communist Party newspaper Granma blasted the embassy for its support of leading dissident Jose Daniel Ferrer, who was arrested nearly two months ago.
Granma accused U.S. diplomats of seeking to destabilize the country, recruit mercenaries and identify new sectors of the economy to sanction rather than boosting ties.
The State Department defended the embassy’s activities and said they would continue.
Cuba regularly brands dissidents as in the pay of Washington.
Also on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Cuban state-run Corporacion Panamericana for facilitating fuel transactions on behalf of another previously sanctioned Cuban entity for its role in Venezuelan oil shipments to the Caribbean island nation.
Over the last year, the United States has added new measures to the decades old trade embargo such as sanctioning any company involved in Venezuelan oil shipments to Cuba. Washington has also allowed Cuban-Americans to sue foreign and U.S. companies for trafficking in properties nationalized in the early months of the Cuban Revolution.
Shortages of everything from fuel and medicine to consumer goods have become common this year in Cuba, which the government blames on sanctions and the United States counters are due to the country’s economic inefficiencies."

Three people were killed and five wounded in the capital's northern Shaab district when a motorcycle exploded, the sources said. A second motorcycle exploded in the southwestern Bayaa district, killing two and wounding six. 
An improvised explosive device went off in the eastern Baladiyat district, killing one person and wounding four.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Islamic State militants are known to make similar attacks in Baghdad and other provinces.
Iraq declared victory over the militants in late 2017 after pushing them out of all territory they held in the country. They have since reverted to hit-and-run insurgency tactics aimed at destabilizing the government.
The explosions did not appear to be related to mass anti-government protests that erupted last month.

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis acknowledged on Tuesday that there had been suspected corruption in the Vatican related to the purchase of a building in London but its discovery showed that new internal financial controls were working.
Speaking to reporters aboard the plane returning from a trip to Thailand and Japan, he sought to assure faithful who contribute to the Church that the Vatican was doing everything possible to guarantee that their money would be used properly.
""It's the first time that in the Vatican the lid was taken off the pot from inside, not from the outside,"" Francis said in response to a question.
He was referring to the fact that in the past, most Vatican financial scandals were unearthed by outsiders.
""Many times before it was uncovered from the outside when others told us 'look' and there was so much shame,"" he said, bringing his hand to his forehead like someone with a headache.
The pope's comments were his first in public since Vatican police raided its regulator, the Financial Information Authority (AIF), and the Secretariat of State, while investigating an investment the Secretariat had made in London real estate.
Five Vatican employees were suspended after the Oct. 1 raids, including AIF director Tommaso di Ruzza.
Domenico Giani, Vatican security chief and the pope's bodyguard, resigned later over the leak of a document related to the investigation, and AIF president Rene Bruelhart's five-year term was not renewed when it expired last week. [L8N27Y2SK]
The pope said the Vatican's acting auditor general told him earlier this year that he suspected impropriety in the deal. Francis said he told auditor to file a complaint with the Vatican's chief magistrate.
""And I was happy about this because it shows that the Vatican administration now has the resources to clear up the ugly things that happen inside,"" Francis said.
""Even if there is the presumption of innocence, the money was not administered well, and there was (suspected) corruption,"" he said.
He said interrogations of the five suspended employees would start soon.
""It's a ugly thing that this happens inside the Vatican but it was brought to light by internal mechanisms that are starting to work,"" he said, referring to financial controls introduced or strengthened since his election in 2013.
He said the fact that the case had been uncovered internally and was being dealt with should assure faithful who may be wary about donating to a yearly collection for the pope's use known as ""Peter's Pence""."

Approved by parliament last month, the bill extends the blackout to 50 days from 14 days, third longest in the world after Cameroon and Tunisia according to the Slovak Academy of Sciences.
The measure was adopted ahead of an election due on Feb. 29 next year with the votes of the ruling leftist Smer party, junior coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) and the opposition far-right People's Party-Our Slovakia.
Its authors said the bill aimed to protect voters from disinformation so they could base their decisions on the parties' programs and actions.
Opposition critics said the measure was a maneuver to disadvantage challengers from new parties.
President Zuzana Caputova argued that the bill violates the right to information granted by the Slovak constitution and that it limited political competition.
She said earlier this month she would ask the Constitutional Court to put the implementation of the legislation on hold until a final ruling whether or not it violated the constitution.
The bill does not ban parties from procuring their own opinion polls, as long as they keep the information out of the public domain.
Slovakia, like other countries in Europe, has seen a rise in new parties in recent years. Caputova, an activist lawyer and political newcomer herself, defeated Smer's candidate in a presidential runoff in March after a late surge in support.
Opposition parties' chances of replacing the three-party government has grown as support for Smer dipped to its lowest level in more than a decade, an opinion poll showed on Tuesday.
Smer has seen a slide in support since last year's murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancee triggered mass protests over corruption and ousted prime minister Robert Fico, who had dominated the euro zone country's politics for a decade.
But his three-party coalition government has survived, led by hand-picked successor Peter Pellegrini, and the socially conservative Smer remains the favorite to take the largest share of the vote.
A coalition of opposition parties, which have ruled out cooperation with Smer, could struggle to present a viable alternative to Smer as it would have to include six or seven parties to win a majority in 150-member parliament.
That might lead to a post-election stalemate, leaving the likely winner Smer without enough partners to form a government and the opposition also short.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Tuesday asked lawmakers to allow troops back on the streets to defend key public infrastructure, even as a human rights group reported ""grave"" abuses by security forces over five weeks of sometimes violent riots.
The continuing protests in Chile over inequality and a shortfall in some social services have left at least 26 dead and thousands injured. They have also hobbled the capital's public transport system, once the envy of Latin America, and caused billions in losses for private business.
Riots have erupted in countries across Latin America, including Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia in recent weeks as regional unrest has spiraled into violence and demands for broad-based reforms.
Pinera sent a bill to Congress Tuesday morning to allow the military to protect transmission lines, electric plants, airports, hospitals and other public infrastructure in order to assure ""basic services.""
He said the move would ""free up the police force ... to protect the security of our citizens.""
Pinera's announcement came shortly after international rights group Human Rights Watch said in a report that police had brutally beat protesters, shot teargas cartridges directly at them, and ran over some with official vehicles or motorcycles.
""There are hundreds of worrying reports of excessive force on the streets and abuse of detainees,” said José Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division, after meeting with Pinera on Tuesday.
The group stopped short of alleging the abuses had been systematic, but its conclusions were in line with a report last week by Amnesty International on the seriousness of many violations. More than 200 Chileans have suffered severe eye injuries alone in clashes with police using rubber bullets.
Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have recommended an immediate overhaul of police protocols and accountability measures to address the mounting allegations of abuse.
Police and military officials have said any cases of alleged abuse are under investigation by civilian courts.
NEW CLASHES
Roadblocks snarled traffic around the Chilean capital Santiago on Tuesday around midday, as protesters set up burning barricades on major streets and highways around the city.
Police used water cannons to disperse protesters in front of the La Moneda presidential palace shortly after Pinera's speech there. Many took to the city's main boulevard afterward, bringing traffic to a standstill.
""This never ends,"" Rosa Olarce, a pharmacy worker, told Reuters as she waited for a bus. ""We'll see what comes of it.""
Pinera in his speech Tuesday morning ticked off a list of reforms, from boosting the minimum wage to slashing the prices of medicines and public transportation, aimed at quelling the protests.
The country's normally fractious political parties have also agreed to work together on a new constitution.
However, protests continue, in smaller numbers but with intense violence at their fringes, driven by mistrust that politicians will keep their promises to bring significant change, and enduring fury over the police handling of demonstrators."

Police refloated the vessel with the use of divers and balloons. It was later transported to a port in Cangas, in Pontevedra province.
Once all the drugs are removed from the submarine, investigators will be able to officially determine its composition and weight.

Turkey has angered the United States and other NATO allies by buying the Russian-made air defense missile system, which the Western allies say is incompatible with NATO defenses.
Washington has suspended Ankara from the F-35 stealth fighter jet programme, which it was helping produce as well as buy.
""We are still working on the technical details. The S-400 systems will not be integrated into the NATO security system or air defense system,"" Kalin told a foreign policy conference in Berlin.
""It will remain an independent defense system on its own. Concerns on this issue can be eased,"" he said.
Earlier on Tuesday, the head of Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport was quoted as saying Russia hoped to seal a deal to supply Turkey with more S-400 missile systems in the first half of next year.
Washington has warned of possible U.S. sanctions but has not yet imposed them. A senior U.S. State Department official said last week that Turkey needed to get rid of the S-400s it had already bought to mend fences."

An international group of journalists released classified Chinese government documents on Sunday that described repressive inner workings of detention camps in China's troubled western region of Xinjiang.
""These reports are consistent with an overwhelming and growing body of evidence that the Chinese Communist Party is committing human rights violations and abuses against individuals in mass detention,"" Pompeo told a news conference, calling on Beijing to release all those arbitrarily detained.
He said the information in the documents confirmed that ""very significant"" human rights abuses were taking place.
""It shows that it's not random, that it is intentional and that it's ongoing,"" he said.
The publication of the documents by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) followed a Nov. 16 New York Times report based on a cache of secret papers revealing details of China's clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the region.
United Nations experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.
The ICIJ said it obtained a 2017 list of guidelines ""that effectively serves as a manual for operating the camps,"" with instructions on how to prevent escapes, maintain secrecy about the camps' existence, indoctrinate internees and ""when to let detainees see relatives or even use the toilet.""
Other documents it obtained include ""intelligence briefings"" showing how police have been ""guided by a massive data collection and analysis system that uses artificial intelligence to select entire categories of Xinjiang residents for detention.""
Beijing denies any mistreatment of Uighurs or others in Xinjiang, saying it is providing vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism and to teach new skills. It dismissed the latest reports as slander.

The leaks have come amid a rising international outcry over China's broader human rights record in Xinjiang. The United States has led more than 30 countries in condemning what it called a ""horrific campaign of repression.""

""When will the bloodshed stop in my country?"" someone had written in neat Arabic script.
Just off Baghdad's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), ground zero for a protest movement that remains unbowed despite the deaths of hundreds of demonstrators in a government crackdown, protesters have set up a ""wall of wishes"".
""I wrote: 'I used to hate Iraq before October 25, now I'm proud of it',"" said Fatima Awad, 16, naming the date last month when protesters first tried to storm the Green Zone of government buildings on the opposite side of the bridge across the Tigris that leads from the square.
""Before, we did not have a future, and no one would protest because everyone was scared. Now, we're all gathered at Tahrir Square,"" she said.
The anti-government protesters accuse the government of corruption and squandering the national wealth. At least 339 people have been killed since the demonstrations began in October. Most of the victims have been unarmed protesters shot with live ammunition.
A note on the wall says simply: ""We want the government to change."" One note calls for the execution of a hated politician; in another, a young man says he wants to finish his sports college.
Activists set up the wall at an abandoned public bathroom. They now plan to compile the wishes in a book.
""We formed a team with a group of youth and we worked with the spirit of one team, as active as bees in a beehive,"" said Sattar Judeh, a writer who helped set up the wall.

Speaking at a news conference, Pompeo said the United States has made it clear to Turkey that Washington wants to see Ankara move away from full operation of the S400 air defense system.
""Yes it is concerning,"" Pompeo said, when he was asked about the reports that Turkish F-16 warplanes flew over the country's capital Ankara on Monday to test its new Russian S-400 missile system.
""We are hopeful. We are still talking to the Turks, still trying to figure out our way through this thing,"" he said.
Ankara and Washington have been at loggerheads over Turkey's purchase of the S-400 system, which Washington says is not compatible with NATO defenses and poses a threat to its F-35 stealth fighter jets, which  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) is developing.

Other demonstrations are expected to continue on Tuesday, the sixth straight day of protests following a 250,000-person march last week organized by the National Strike Committee.
The committee said in a statement early on Tuesday it would demand ""a permanent negotiation until the agenda for which the Nov. 21 strike was called is resolved"" in a meeting with President Ivan Duque. 
The meeting lasted about two hours, with committee leaders demanding Duque meet with them without including business leaders or other sectors.
Thousands of peaceful protesters have taken to the streets over issues including economic reforms, police violence and corruption.
Duque denies supporting rumored economic plans that have galvanized many protesters - including a cut to the minimum wage for young people. Demonstrators have also highlighted what they say is a lack of government action to stop the murder of hundreds of human rights activists and asked Duque to fully implement a 2016 peace deal with leftist rebels.
Asked as he left the meeting what the government could do to end protests, Confederation of Colombian Workers president Luis Miguel Morantes told Reuters ""it is a negotiation, there will be things that go to a certain point, there will be a fair balance, there will be other things we have to wait for, like changes in laws, it's very relative.""
The committee wanted an ""exclusive"" dialogue, but the government would like them to form part of national discussions, said official Diego Molano.
""They must understand that there are other sectors which also want to debate the issues of employment, who have proposals for young people,"" Molano told journalists.
The death on Monday of Dilan Cruz, 18, is likely to fuel further criticism of the crowd dispersion tactics of the ESMAD riot police, which include tear gas and stun grenades.
Cruz, who was injured on Saturday, has become a symbol for many young protesters. On Tuesday mourners were gathering at makeshift shrines outside the hospital where he was treated and the place where he was hit.
The strike committee said it would ask Duque to shut down the ESMAD and ""purify"" the police.
The committee will increase the intensity of the strike on Wednesday ""in homage to the symbol of the national strike Dylan Cruz,"" the statement said, using a different spelling of Cruz's first name than that used by his sister and the government.

It will also demand that the government's tax reform proposal, which includes a cut in duties on businesses, be rejected.

Russia is due to deploy next month the Avangard system, a hypersonic glide vehicle designed to sit atop an intercontinental ballistic missile, one of several new types of weapons touted by President Vladimir Putin as ahead of their time.
The Defence Ministry said a group of visiting U.S. arms inspectors had been shown the Avangard system from Nov. 24-26 under the auspices of the New START treaty, which came into effect in 2011.
The treaty limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads the world’s two biggest nuclear powers can deploy to no more than 1,550 each.
The treaty, which is due to expire in 2021, also curbs the number of nuclear launchers and deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers they can have.
Putin has said Moscow is ready to extend the pact, but has complained about what he sees as Washington’s lack of interest.
President Donald Trump, who told Putin in 2017 he thought it a bad deal for the United States, will only decide next year whether or not to extend the treaty, U.S. officials have said.

VALLETTA (Reuters) - A top aide to Malta's prime minister resigned on Tuesday and was questioned by police investigating the murder of a prominent journalist, while two government ministers also stood aside in a widening scandal rocking the European Union's smallest state.
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told reporters his chief of staff, Keith Schembri, had quit as police stepped up their investigation into the 2017 killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia.
Hours later, Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi also announced his resignation and Economy Minister Christian Cardona said he was suspending himself from his duties until the murder investigation was concluded.
Both Mizzi and Cardona denied any involvement in the death of Caruana Galizia, an investigative reporter who repeatedly denounced corruption at the highest levels of government on the Mediterranean island before she was blown up by a car bomb.
Police searched Schembri's house during the day, sources said, but gave no further details. Neither Schembri nor his lawyer were immediately available for comment.
Schembri and Mizzi had been facing pressure to resign from opposition politicians and Caruana Galizia's family because of their alleged financial ties to businessman Yorgen Fenech, who was detained last week as a person of interest in the probe. 
Cardona was briefly questioned by police on Saturday in connection with the case.
The alleged murder plot middleman Melvin Theuma was granted a presidential pardon on Monday in return for evidence that could be used in court. Local media reported that he had handed over audio recordings.
""What is happening now, and what happened last week is an operation that is hopefully solving the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder,"" Muscat told Reuters on Tuesday. ""Whatever people might say, there is no impunity in this country.""
Muscat is a close friend of Schembri and had repeatedly rejected calls to sack him when allegations of corruption surfaced several years ago. Schembri always denied wrongdoing.
""TURBULENT TIME""
Three men are awaiting trial for setting off the bomb that killed Caruana Galizia, and police sources say the investigation into who actually ordered the killing has made big advances in the past week.
Neither Fenech nor his lawyer have made any comment since his detention.
A Reuters investigation last year revealed that Fenech was the owner of a secret company called 17 Black, which was named in emails as being the vehicle to fund secret Panama companies owned by Schembri and Mizzi.
It is not known whether any funds actually changed hands. Schembri, who has many business interests, and Mizzi have always denied wrongdoing.
Opposition politicians and Caruana Galizia's family have denounced Muscat for allowing the two men stay at their posts and have called on him to step down. 
""Muscat, who spent three years taking full responsibility for Schembri, must leave right now. He simply cannot be trusted to not obstruct justice. He has done so for too long,"" Caruana Galizia's son Matthew wrote on Twitter.
A regular session of parliament was suspended on Tuesday as opposition lawmakers heckled the government benches, yelling ""mafia"" at their political opponents. 
Muscat said he had no intention of resigning.
""My role right now is to ensure the country has stable leadership. My role is to make sure we navigate through this turbulent time,"" he told Reuters.

The comments by Economy Minister Paulo Guedes to reporters on a visit to Washington on Monday were seemingly meant to criticize the polarization of Brazilian politics but set off a storm of criticism from the left in Brazil.
Asked about the threat of protests seen in many parts of South America spreading to Brazil following the release of leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva from prison, Guedes stressed he did not believe calling people to the streets was democratic.
""Is democracy only when your side wins? When the other side wins, after 10 months you convoke everyone to take to the streets? What kind of responsibility is that? Don't be startled then if someone asks for an AI-5,"" Guedes said, referring to a decree passed during the dictatorship which permitted the closing down of congress as well as censorship and torture.
Gleisi Hoffmann, leader of the leftist main opposition PT party, criticized Guedes on Twitter, saying he ""defends the use of AI-5"" and a view of politics that ""the people must suffer in silence.""
The head of the Supreme Court, Dias Toffoli, came out against the comments saying the ""AI-5 is incompatible with a democracy."" ""You do not build a future with the failed experiences of the past,"" he said.
Guedes tried to walk back on his comments, saying they were off the record. He later sought to clarify his position by saying the return of the decree would not happen.
""It's inconceivable, Brazilian democracy would never have it, even if the left grabs its arms and breaks the Planalto Palace by force, it's inconceivable,"" he said, clearly irritated
His remarks come weeks after Lula was released from prison, setting off a political clash with right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula has vowed to unite the left to win the 2022 elections.
In October, Brazilian lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of President Bolsonaro, suggested in an interview that his father's government could consider issuing the toughest legal instrument from Brazil's military dictatorship, the AI-5, if the left decided to radicalize."

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary has submitted draft legislation to the European Commission to amend the country's nuclear safety protocols to custom-fit a 12 billion euro Russian-led nuclear plant expansion project that it wants to speed up, eight sources told Reuters.
The draft legislation was detailed to Reuters by the Hungarian Atomic Energy Agency (HAEA), and corroborated by several sources with knowledge of the matter who wanted to remain unidentified.
The EU review was confirmed by an EU official requesting anonymity, as well as several Hungarian government sources. Eight sources, including high-ranking government officials, confirmed the plan.
Hungary wants to expand its 2-gigawatt Paks nuclear power plant with two Russian-made VVER reactors, each with a capacity of 1.2 gigawatts.
The project, awarded in 2014 without a tender to nuclear giant Rosatom, an arm of the Russian government, is often cited as a sign of exceptionally warm ties between Hungarian premier Viktor Orban and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a connection that has unnerved Western allies.
However, Rosatom struggled to meet EU and Hungarian safety criteria, delaying the project by several years, and the Russian and Hungarian governments now want to accelerate it.
Under the proposed new rules, license applications to build the reactor hole and surrounding insulating slurry wall could be considered before the entire project receives the green light - a break with prior protocol, which only allowed partial licenses to be considered once the construction license was granted.
Hungary's top official in charge of energy policy, Technology Ministry State Secretary Peter Kaderjak, confirmed to Reuters the government was working with the European Commission to recast nuclear power plant construction rules.
Kaderjak called the Paks 2 project ""the cornerstone of Hungary's energy and climate strategy"".
""We are seeking ways to cut the project execution time as short as possible, fully respecting nuclear safety,"" he said. ""That explains this draft amendment.""
RISKY MOVE
The modification carries risks and makes the project much more difficult to abandon or modify as the framework, literally, will be set in stone, according to seven sources with knowledge of the matter who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
But the move could help the Hungarian government in its haggling with Moscow to modify the current build-and-finance package. Hungary wants to extend the current payment start date of 2026, which was fixed when the project was first conceived.
Russia wants to avoid paying delay penalties - by putting off the completion deadline to about 2029 and by having Hungary ease regulatory hurdles such as this one, these sources said.
The changes will appear in a government decree called the Nuclear Safety Regulations once the European Commission's nuclear arm, the Euratom Supply Agency, approves the changes.
An EU source also confirmed the Commission was assessing draft legislation against the EU's latest Nuclear Safety Directive, adding it had three months to make recommendations, a deadline that is not yet up.
""In this framework, the Hungarian authorities have made several such notifications to the Commission in recent years,"" the EU source told Reuters. ""The latest of these notifications was received this year and is currently being assessed.""
Asked about the changes, the HAEA told Reuters that reactor hole and slurry wall work, and some equipment that takes a long time to manufacture, may undergo the licensing process parallel with the evaluation of the construction license application.
""Licenses cannot be granted before the construction license is issued - except for work on soil solidification, soil removal, and the water insulation work to section off the work area, especially the slurry wall permits.""
Experts estimate the reactor hole to be several hundred meters wide and several hundred meters long, up to 100 meters deep, surrounded by a concrete slurry wall more than a meter thick. This phase alone could take a year or more to execute.
The changes are designed to save time so once the overall construction license is issued work can begin on the power plant buildings.
But experts warned the slurry wall and reactor hole could cost hundreds of millions of euros, and hastening them carries risk: if the HAEA find faults with the overall design, it may require changes that conflict with the concrete already poured, causing a potential cost spike and long delay.
""Even with these permits Paks 2 carries responsibility for any work it executes, as the ongoing construction licensing process could influence all other licensing,"" the HAEA said."

TURNBERRY, Scotland (Reuters) - A British startup is teaching farmers how to grow crops using water from a source which won't run out – the sea.
Seawater Solutions is helping farmers on Scotland's west coast adapt to the reality of less rain by choosing salt-resistant plants and developing saltmarshes - land flooded by tidal waters - for them to grow in.
""These plants can create eco-systems and promote wildlife, but they can also feed us in a sustainable way and return health to the soil,"" said Seawater Solutions founder Yanik Nyberg, as he planted sea aster – a flavorsome, wild plant.
The company is working with Jay Crawford, a potato and carrot farmer, to farm an acre of his land previously underused because of its exposure to the sea wind and salt spray.
""We've taken a piece of land here that was maybe only going to yield a couple of hundred pounds per year into something that could maybe yield a couple of thousand pounds per year,"" he said.
Pipelines running from the sea bring water that recreates the tide and irrigates crops of bright green samphire stalks and sea blite, a herb-like plant that looks like rosemary, as well as aster.
Typically used as gourmet garnishes, the plants are becoming more mainstream and demand is growing by 10% per year, according to Seawater Solutions.
George Chubb (NYSE:CB) of Glasgow greengrocer Roots and Fruits said the plants were really popular because of their ""extreme taste"" and ""eco credentials"".
Growing populations, intensive farming and climate change are putting pressure on the world's limited water supplies, researchers say. United Nations data shows two billion people – a quarter of the world's population – are now using water much faster than natural sources can be replenished."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Turkey is refusing to back a NATO defense plan for the Baltics and Poland until the alliance offers Ankara more political support for its fight against Kurdish YPG militia in northern Syria, four senior alliance sources said.
Ankara has told its NATO envoy not to sign off on the plan and is taking a tough line in meetings and in private conversations, demanding the alliance recognize the YPG as terrorists in the formal wording, the sources said.
Turkey's NATO delegation was not immediately available for comment. Turkey's defense and foreign ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
The dispute, before NATO holds its 70th anniversary summit in London next week, is a sign of divisions between Ankara and Washington over Turkey's offensive in northern Syria against the YPG militia, which it regards as terrorists with links to Kurdish militants on Turkish soil.
NATO envoys are seeking formal approval by all 29 member states for the military plan to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the event of a Russian attack.
Without Turkey's approval, it could be harder for NATO to step up its defenses in the Baltics and Poland quickly.
""They (the Turks) are taking eastern Europeans hostage, blocking approval of this military planning until they get concessions,"" one of the diplomatic sources told Reuters.
A second source called Turkey's behavior ""disruptive"" as NATO tries to show it is united after U.S. President Donald Trump voiced scepticism about the alliance and French President Emmanuel Macron suggested it was experiencing ""brain death"".
Asked about the issue, NATO's spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said: ""NATO has plans for defending all allies. NATO's commitment to the safety and security of all allies is unwavering.""
Turkey began its offensive in northern Syria after the United States pulled 1,000 troops out of the area last month. Ankara's NATO allies fear the incursion will undermine the battle against Islamic State militants.
COLLECTIVE DEFENCE
The plan for the Baltic states and Poland, drawn up at their request after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, has no direct bearing on Turkey's strategy in Syria, but it raises issues about security on all of NATO's frontiers.
Under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's 1949 founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all, and the alliance has military strategies for collective defense across its territory.
Turkey made its demands before its offensive in northern Syria but the issue has come to a head because of next week's summit, at which security documents are to be approved.
NATO envoys still hope for a compromise because Ankara also needs leaders to approve a separate, upgraded military plan detailing how NATO would defend Turkey in the event of an attack, two of the diplomatic sources said.
Macron, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will meet on the summit's margins to discuss Ankara's Syria operation.
""Everyone is criticizing them (the Turks), but if they give in, it will be at the cost of non-interference in their Syria strategy,"" one of the diplomatic sources said."

The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 from Dubai, operated by the Dubai-based budget carrier Flydubai, came down in the early hours of March 19, 2016, at Rostov-on-Don airport in southern Russia on its second attempt to land. All 62 people on board died. 
""The fatal air accident ... occurred during the second go-around, due to an incorrect aircraft configuration and crew piloting (and) the subsequent loss of the (commanding pilot’s) situational awareness at night-time,"" the report said.
It said bad weather and dangerous local turbulence known as wind shear were also factors.
""This resulted in a loss of control of the aircraft and its impact with the ground,"" it said.
The Boeing 737 was being flown by the captain at the time of the crash, the investigation said.
Addressing one of the most publicised concerns after the crash, the report said the pilots had had enough pre-flight rest, but that the possible ""operational"" tiredness of the crew as the flight progressed was probably a contributing factor. 

The accident involved a Boeing 737-800, the predecessor to the Boeing 737 MAX, which remains grounded after two fatal crashes in the past 13 months. The 737-800 does not contain the MCAS software implicated in those crashes.

Brazil's government said it does not expect any resistance to his nomination and had received positive feedback from the United States.
Bolsonaro had initially pushed for the nomination of his son Eduardo as ambassador but ultimately gave up on the idea amid a spat with his then-political party, known as the PSL. At one point, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would welcome Eduardo as ambassador.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The father of a prominent Pakistani activist who fled to the United States was released on bail on Tuesday, his family and lawyers said, a month after he was arrested for allegedly spreading hate of the state on social media.
Muhammad Ismail was detained on Oct. 24 after leaving a court in the northwestern city of Peshawar. He is accused of uploading material to his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page ""prejudicial to the interests of the State institutions"", according to a court document seen by Reuters.
His daughter, 32-year-old Gulalai Ismail, is a prominent member of a group campaigning for the rights of the ethnic Pashtun minority, and is a vocal critic of Pakistan's military. She went into hiding earlier this year and surfaced in the United States in September.
Ismail was freed after posting bail of 100,000 Pakistani rupees ($645), according to a court document.
He was not reachable for comment on Tuesday, but has previously denied the allegations and said during his bail hearing on Monday he had been trapped by a ""well-planned conspiracy"", without elaborating further.
His daughter said in a tweet on Tuesday she would not give up her activism despite the arrest.
""(If) the purpose is to coerce me into silence then it won't happen. Neither I would, nor my parents will let me,"" she said.
A top U.S. government official had previously expressed concern about harassment faced by Ismail's family from unknown parties, and rights group Amnesty International has called the charges against her father ""trumped up"".
""While we welcome this news, all charges against him must be dropped and his release should be unconditional,"" the group said in a statement on Tuesday.
Gulalai Ismail's group, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), has clashed with the military, which has accused it of disloyalty and being funded by Pakistan's regional rivals Afghanistan and India.
The PTM has gained considerable support to the alarm of the military, which is wary of Pashtun nationalism in the strategically sensitive Pashtun lands along the Afghan border."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - As members of the European Parliament gathered in Strasbourg this week, a German politician claimed he had found a treaty loophole that could put a stop to the monthly caravan of EU lawmakers and their staff from Brussels to the French city.
Members of the European Union's assembly (MEPs) convene in Strasbourg for one week every month and in Brussels for the remainder. According to a 2014 audit, the monthly upheaval costs the bloc 114 million euros ($126 million) a year.
Critics have long called for the arrangement to be scrapped, but it has stayed in place largely because France would veto any attempt to make the required amendment to the EU treaty.
German MEP Nico Semsrott says he noticed that the Treaty of Amsterdam stipulates that the parliament should have its seat in Strasbourg, but did not say ""in the city of Strasbourg"".
In a spoof video on YouTube, the 33-year-old lawmaker goes to a plenary hall of the parliament in Brussels and ceremonially smashes a bottle at its entrance to name it 'Strasbourg'.
Semsrott, a member of the German 'satirical' party Die PARTEI and a slam poet, was elected to the European Parliament last May.
""I am already tired of doing the back and forth,"" he told Reuters by phone from Strasbourg. ""Over five years I will have to be in cars or trains for more than 60 working days.""
Aside from the cost, many critics of the two-seat parliament point to the carbon footprint of 751 MEPs - and many more advisers and officials - decamping from Brussels to Strasbourg and then returning a few days later.
British MEP Matthew Patten called in a speech to the assembly on Tuesday for an end to ""the senseless pollution"" caused by the parliamentary circus.
""By 2050 it would save over 600,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions,"" he said. ""It would send a massive signal to Europe and the world that the EU is really serious about fighting climate change."""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europeans spent at least 11.6 billion euros ($12.7 billion) in 2017 on illegal cannabis purchases, confirming marijuana as the largest drugs market in the 28-country European Union, the bloc's anti-drugs agency said on Tuesday.
In its annual report, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) said the EU's overall narcotics market was worth at least 30 billion euros in 2017, up from 24 billion in 2013.
The global market for illicit drugs was estimated to be worth between $426 and $652 billion, the agency said, warning that its estimates about the EU market were conservative.
Illegal sales of herbal cannabis and its resin represented 39% of the EU's drugs market, up from 38% in 2013, with revenues for criminal organizations dwarfing those in legal markets.
Marijuana shops in California, the world's largest legal market for cannabis, had revenues worth around $2.5 billion last year, industry data show.
Cannabis consumed in the EU is increasingly produced there.
Imported resin comes mostly from Morocco, while Albania is a key exporter of herbal cannabis, the report said, warning that prices and potency were growing.
Cocaine is the second most consumed illegal drug in the EU, with sales generating revenues of at least 9 billion euros in 2017, while the heroin market was worth more than 7 billion euros.
""The European drug market is increasingly characterized by consumers having access to a wide variety of high-purity and high-potency products,"" the report said.
This reflects high levels of output globally and within the EU, with cocaine production in South America and heroin manufacturing in Afghanistan estimated to be at historically high levels, the EU agency said.
Organized crime groups pocket vast revenues, fuelling violence and corruption, the report said.
Some proceeds also go to militant organizations, the report said, with research showing narcotics among major sources of income for groups like West Africa's Boko Haram, Islamic State and Somalia's al-Shabaab.
It also warned of increasingly sophisticated laundering methods, including cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin remains the most popular virtual currency for criminals, but some EU states have detected a growing use of currencies guaranteeing greater anonymity, including monero and zcash, the report said.
It also reiterated money-laundering risks posed by high-denomination banknotes, notably 200 and 500 euro notes, which are used by cash couriers to smuggle dirty money.
Because of concerns over crime, the 500 euro banknote is no longer being issued by the European Central Bank but remains legal tender, as cash-loving countries like Germany prefer not to outlaw it."

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - The Slovenian government approved legislation on Tuesday that will prohibit paramilitary groups, after a group led by a nationalist politician began conducting border patrols in the woods in recent months.
""Guarding the state border is an exclusive responsibility of the police,"" the government said in a statement, adding paramilitary groups were obstructing the work of the police and causing alarm and fear.
Two weeks ago Reuters reported that a more than 50-strong group, dressed in camouflage uniforms and armed with air rifles, were patrolling a border zone between Slovenia and Croatia where the group's leader said illegal migration is rife.
The leader, Andrej Sisko, who heads a fringe nationalist party, Gibanje Zedinjena Slovenija, had said authorities were failing to protect Slovenia against what he saw as a migrant threat.
Under the legislation approved by the cabinet and now due to be passed by parliament in coming months, civilians will be banned from conducting patrols of the border area and obstructing the work of the police.
They will be prohibited from using masks, uniforms or objects that resemble weapons in such a way as to give the impression they are state or army officials. The fine would be between 500 and 2,000 euros ($550 to $2,200) per person.
Anti-immigrant sentiment in Slovenia and other ex-communist European Union countries has risen sharply since 2015, when more than a million asylum seekers passed through eastern Europe en route to richer countries further north and west.
The overland route into Europe across the Balkans has largely been shut for the past three years. But according to the police the number of migrants crossing illegally from Croatia to Slovenia - where a razor-wire fence has been erected along stretches of the border since 2015 - rose to 14,066 in the first ten months of this year from 8,186 in the same period of 2018."

LONDON (Reuters) - More than 2 million under-35s have applied to vote in Britain's Dec. 12 election since the poll was called just four weeks ago, government data showed ahead of Tuesday's registration deadline.
The outcome of next month's election, which will determine how, when and even whether Britain leaves the European Union, remains uncertain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives are ahead in opinion polls but two published this week have shown their lead narrowing.
Game of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke and Grime star Stormzy are among celebrities who have been urging people to register to take part in the election. Voters have until 2359 GMT on Tuesday to register and can do so online. 
Britain's electoral watchdog, the Electoral Commission, said one in three 18 and 19-year-olds are not registered to vote.
""Private renters, too, anyone who has recently moved home, people without a fixed address and those in some black and Asian communities - all these groups are less likely to be registered. They are at risk of missing out,"" said Electoral Commission Director of Communications, Policy and Research Craig Westwood.
""If you want to make sure your voice is heard, do it now.""
Government data shows that nearly 3.2 million people applied to register to vote between Oct. 29, when the election was called, and Monday. Of these almost 1.2 million were under 25 and just under 966,000 were aged 25-34.
The final number added to the electoral register could be lower, as some may turn out to have already been registered.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been on a push to encourage people to register, particularly young voters who are typically more likely to back his left-leaning party.
""Dodgy landlords are registered to vote. Bad bosses are registered to vote. And the super-rich who've rigged the system are registered to vote. Are you?,"" he said on Twitter on Tuesday.
Stormzy also shared the link to register online and urged people it was ""very, very, very important"" everyone did so.

""Don't sit there and think 'my one little vote ain't gonna do anything' - your vote is CRUCIAL. Your 'one little vote' can quite literally tip the scale for what will be the most important election of our generation,"" he said on Twitter.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 07:29AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sudan militia leader grew rich by selling gold,"By Khalid Abdelaziz, Michael Georgy and Maha El Dahan 
KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Late last year, as President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's hold on power weakened, one of Sudan's most feared militia leaders lashed out against the government of his long-time ally and benefactor.
In a speech to cheering troops, militia chief Mohamed ""Hemedti"" Hamdan Dagalo sympathised with the thousands of protesters who had poured onto the streets in December demanding food, fuel and an end to corruption. He hit out at officials ""who take what isn't theirs.""
""There are some people who are doing great harm, and they are the officials, not the poor,"" he raged.
After years of loyally supporting Bashir, Hemedti took part in the military coup that toppled the leader in April and is now a senior figure in the transitional government that is preparing the ground for elections in three years' time. Under the constitution, members of the transitional government aren't allowed to engage in private business activity. 
Now a Reuters investigation has found that even as Hemedti was accusing Bashir's people of enriching themselves at the public's expense, a company that Hemedti's family owns was flying gold bars worth millions of dollars to Dubai.
Current and former government officials and gold industry sources said that in 2018 as Sudan's economy was imploding, Bashir gave Hemedti free rein to sell Sudan's most valuable natural resource through this family firm, Algunade. At times Algunade bypassed central bank controls over gold exports, at others it sold to the central bank for a preferential rate, half a dozen sources said. A central bank spokesman said he had no information about the matter.
Airway bills and invoices, reviewed by Reuters, give a rare glimpse into Algunade's dealings - a closely-guarded secret in a country where two thirds of the population live in poverty. The documents, covering a four-week period from the end of last year, show Algunade sent around $30 million of gold bars to Dubai, around a ton in weight.
In the past, Hemedti has spoken openly about owning gold interests, most recently in an interview with the BBC in August. ""I'm not the first man to have gold mines. It's true, we have gold mines, and there's nothing preventing us from working in gold,"" he said then. 
But in response to Reuters' questions for this article, Hemedti's office denied any link between the commander and Algunade. In a separate interview, Algunade's general manager, Abdelrahman al-Bakri, said the firm is owned by Hemedti's brother Abdelrahim, who is also the deputy head of Hemedti's Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Nevertheless, Bakri maintained there was no connection between Algunade and Hemedti and his RSF, which has evolved from a militia in Darfur to Sudan's most powerful paramilitary group.
""Algunade is as far as can be from the RSF,"" he told Reuters at the firm's heavily secured headquarters. He showed Reuters registration documents that named Abdelrahim as the company's owner. Reuters was unable to contact Abdelrahim. Bakri acknowledged that Algunade exported gold to Dubai in late 2018 but said it had done so at the request of Bashir's intelligence agency. He denied the firm sold gold to the central bank at a preferential rate.
MY PROTECTOR
Hemedti's grip on Sudan's vital gold trade illustrates the scale of the challenge to rescue an economy broken by decades of mismanagement, corruption and war.
His career began as a militia man in western Darfur, where rebels took up arms against Khartoum in 2003. Bashir mobilized several militia to quell the revolt and, in the conflict that followed, some 300,000 people were killed and two million more driven from their homes. The government disowned ""outlaw"" fighters who murdered civilians, but the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Bashir for war crimes and the United States imposed further economic sanctions against his government.
In Darfur, Hemedti earned a reputation as a ruthless commander and a loyal servant to Bashir. The president called him ""Hemayti,"" meaning ""my protector."" After Hemedti seized the goldmines of Darfur's Jebel Amer mountain region, Bashir allowed him to hold onto the prize.
""He became the new king of Jebel Amer and its gold,"" said Amjad Farid, a politician and pro-democracy activist. ""For Bashir, he was his loyal boy, his protection force.""
Hemedti and his militia took full control of the Jebel Amer mines in 2017 - the year the United States began lifting economic sanctions against Sudan. He faced few obstacles as he expanded his operations from Darfur to South Kordofan and other regions of the country.
Algunade traded with poor, artisan miners who used toxic mercury to extract gold, at grave risk to their health. The leftover soil, known locally as ""Karta,"" was trucked to Algunade's plants where it was treated with cyanide to harvest the remaining ore.
These practices have sometimes brought Algunade into conflict with local people. In October, people in the town of Talodi, South Kordofan, set fire to the Algunade plant, accusing the firm of plundering their gold and polluting their soil.
""This gold belongs to us and this is our land, handed down by our grandfathers. Why should we give the gold to Algunade? We burned the factory to stop pollution and to stop them stealing our gold,"" said miner Haroun Abdallah.
Algunade's general manager, Bakri, said the ""citizens of South Kordofan should say thank you very much to Algunade"" for all it had done for the area. He estimated the attack on the facility caused damage of about $6 million. 
A global campaign against the use of mercury in gold mining and other industries led to a United Nations treaty, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which will prohibit the manufacture, import and export of products containing mercury by 2020. Sudan's Energy and Mining Minister Adil Ibrahim told Reuters his country would comply with the agreement. The convention does not extend to cyanide, however. 
""Cyanide is more serious because it seeps into the earth, and can be washed by rain, and it kills so many animals and seeps into drinking water and affects vegetation in the area,"" said Anwar al-Haj the chair of Sudan Democracy First Group, a non-governmental organization which advocates for democracy. It published a report in 2018 that asserted a link between the use of hazardous chemicals in mining and increased miscarriages, birth defects and deaths.
Energy and Mining Minister Ibrahim said the government would help miners find alternatives to mercury, but cyanide use would continue because, if handled properly, it isn't harmful.
SPECIAL TREATMENT
Sudan's central bank is supposed to oversee gold exports, but two current and one former government official and several industry sources told Reuters that Bashir sometimes allowed Hemedti to circumvent this rule. The former president let Algunade sell gold as it liked, these people said, because Hemedti's RSF militia was a useful counterweight to generals in the regular military whom Bashir perceived as a threat to his rule.
The export documents and invoices reviewed by Reuters, covering a four-week period from the end of 2018, showed Algunade doing business with one counterparty in Dubai, a company called Rozella. Contacted by Reuters, Rozella confirmed the firm had dealt with Algunade. A company official said transactions between the two companies took place over a period of three months in late 2018. Algunade's general manager Bakri told Reuters that Rozella was the only firm Algunade dealt with in Dubai.
Under the arrangement with Bashir, Algunade would hand some of its export earnings to the state, to pay for the government's fuel and wheat purchases, government officials said. Algunade's general manager, Bakri, confirmed that some of the proceeds of gold sales were used to buy fuel. He said Algunade bypassed the central bank only for three months in late 2018, at Bashir’s request.
A senior government official, however, told Reuters, ""there were no official records showing that Algunade gave money"" to the state. This official said Hemedti used proceeds from gold exports ""to buy weapons for Bashir and himself."" He estimated that Hemedti pumped millions of dollars into buying weapons and vehicles for the RSF that roams the streets with rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns mounted on jeeps. Asked if revenues from Algunade's gold sales were used to buy weapons, Bakri maintained there was no connection between the firm and the RSF or Hemedti. Hemedti's office declined to comment beyond denying any link between the commander and Algunade.
The head of Sudan's gold exporters' union Abdel Monem al-Siddiq said that even when Algunade sold its gold to the central bank as it was supposed to, it received a preferential rate - a claim Algunade's general manager Bakri rejected as ""fake news.""
With tens of thousands of soldiers, the RSF is Hemedti's power base. It is deployed across the country to protect gold mines and strategic buildings. Thousands of its fighters have fought for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen's civil war. Hemedti's fighters are deeply loyal. 
""The leader sometimes takes the time to talk to us militiamen by telephone. We will always support him,"" said one fighter, declining to be named because he wasn't permitted to talk to the media. He said he was paid $20,000 to fight in Yemen for six months. Many of his countrymen live on less than $10 a month.
""IT'S A MESS""
Energy and Mining Minister Ibrahim faces a big challenge to reform the gold industry. He said successive ministers failed to ensure concessions were awarded fairly and transparently, leading to corruption. ""It's a mess,"" he added.
Finance Minister Ibrahim Elbadawi, who estimated Sudan needs up to $5 billion in international support, said the government will push to end monopolies in sectors including gold mining. Algunade's general manager Bakri insisted Algunade doesn't have market dominance.
For many Sudanese, Hemedti and his firm are symbols of the country's repressive past and economic inequalities.
One gold trader told Reuters how he stood up during an industry conference recently to complain that Hemedti's gold business had become too dominant. Two days later, he said, police hauled him to the prosecutor's office for questioning about his comments. His account couldn't be independently confirmed.

At the gold souk in downtown Khartoum, a large sign advertising Algunade blazes above rows and rows of idle jewellery shops. Few Sudanese can afford to buy these days, said shopkeeper Mohammed Awad. When asked if gold exports had harmed his business, another trader pointed to the Algunade sign above him and said: ""We hope that Hemedti will change his ways and keep the gold inside the country.""

The case of Harry Dunn, 19, who died in August after his motorcycle collided with a car driven by Anne Sacoolas, has caused difficulties for Raab since Sacoolas left Britain claiming diplomatic immunity, outraging many Britons.
Arriving at an election candidates' debate in his parliamentary constituency on Monday night, Raab refused to stop for a conversation with Tim Dunn, Harry Dunn's father, who has publicly criticised Raab's handling of the case.
""We feel he's lied to us two or three times in meetings and in statements he's made in the (House of) Commons,"" Tim Dunn later told reporters outside the debate venue, a church in a southwest suburb of London.
""And we feel that people should know how he really is as a gentleman and how he comes across to us as our family.""
Footage of the two men's brief exchange, broadcast by  ITV  (LON:ITV), showed Raab telling Dunn that he would be happy to see him any time but did not want to keep the audience inside the debate venue waiting.
After Dunn repeated his request to talk to him, Raab pointed his finger at Dunn, saying it was ""not on"" that Dunn was trying to talk to him ""right in front of the cameras"", then turned away and strode off.
Dunn and a group of his supporters were denied access to the debate venue. The BBC quoted a member of staff at the church saying this was due to fire safety concerns.
The group waited until the end of the debate and booed Raab as he left.
Raab is campaigning for re-election to parliament in the Dec. 12 vote. His predecessor as Conservative member of parliament for the same constituency, who disagrees with the ruling party's policy to ""get Brexit done"", has urged voters to shun Raab and instead vote for the Liberal Democrat candidate.
The Conservative Party and the Foreign Office did not respond to requests for comment.
The case of Harry Dunn gained international prominence when his parents met U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House and he tried to persuade them to meet with Sacoolas, who was in the building at the same time.
The parents, who had not been told she would be there, declined. They want Sacoolas to return to Britain to face police questioning about the crash that killed their son."

ON BOARD THE OPEN ARMS (Reuters) - Migrants danced and burst into song as a rescue ship brought them into the Italian port of Taranto at dawn on Tuesday, days after they were found drifting in a rubber dinghy in the Mediterranean.
The 62 mostly West and Central Africans packed up their bedding before coming ashore, celebrating the end of a political tussle over their fate - Italy had initially refused to take them and only relented at the weekend.
""Hopefully they can leave these terrible experiences they've lived behind and Europe will treat them with humanity,"" said a spokeswoman for the Spanish charity Open Arms, which found the migrants 50 miles off Libya on Wednesday last week.
Italy said the charity's ship Open Arms should drop the migrants off in Tripoli under international arrangements. But Rome changed its position after the coastguard evacuated 11 other members of the group, including young children and several injured.
The Italian government has taken a hard line against immigration and has previously resisted attempts by rescue ships to land migrants in its territory.

There have been nearly 1,000 confirmed deaths on the three main migration routes across the Mediterranean so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A month of intense protests against inequality and police repression in Santiago have transformed the Chilean capital's streetscape into a caterwaul of graffiti whose messages reflect the deep discontent in this once genteel Latin American city. 
The warm, dry air typical of springtime now bears the lingering sting of teargas, and shops and office blocks have become fortresses, adorned with metal curtains to protect them from demonstrators' stones or Molotov cocktails.
Commuters move past blackened barricades smoldering across many streets and take their chances at busy road junctions where traffic lights have been vandalized. 
The subway network, one of Latin America's most modern, continues to run at half-strength, with more than 20 stations still closed after arson attacks.
Grey and sandstone walls have been blanketed with colorful murals. 
""The street is ours,"" proclaims one message on a closed gate. Walls bear war cries, jokes, political demands, rejections of injustice and inequality and claims against ""murderous"" police. 
President Sebastian Pinera is addressed frequently and bluntly, with one scrawl reading: ""Resign. Nobody wants you.""
The messages also reflect a horrifying, and largely unique, characteristic of the Chilean protests: the injuries to more than 200 people's eyes by police rubber bullets or tear gas cannisters. 
""Now it is a privilege to have both eyes,"" spits one. A poster shows Chile's long thin nation cascading as a stream of blood from an injured eye.
Police insist they have followed protocol in the use of force and that all allegations of wrongdoing that have been reported will be thoroughly investigated. 
The police chief last week suspended the use of rubber bullets and ordered further tests after a university study suggested they were only 20% rubber and contained lead. 
In Plaza Italia, rechristened Plaza de la Dignidad for having been the focal point for mass mobilizations, parts of the pavement have been ripped up and a statue of a military hero mounted on horseback has been swathed in flags, scarves and paint. 
There, some find the city's changed face heartbreaking while others see it as emblematic of broader changes that must come.
""I far prefer this painted and awakened Chile to a passive and quiet oasis,"" said Miguel Delso, a 32-year-old architect, who was demonstrating with a group of colleagues and architecture students.
Antonio Rivas, a 25-year-old Venezuelan engineer who migrated to Santiago, saw things differently: ""I don't understand why, to ask for fair and just treatment, you have to go out and destroy everything,"" he said as he took pictures on his cell phone of paint-streaked walls.
On the four-lane Alameda thoroughfare that marchers stream down towards Plaza Italia each afternoon, traffic is replaced by enterprising street vendors offering demonstrators everything they might need to make their point. 
T-shirts with diverse slogans reflect the long list of causes, while flags and scarves share the pavement with gas masks, eye goggles, slingshots and nets of marbles and spray bottles of water and bicarbonate of soda, to neutralize the effect of teargas.
Many young protesters readily compare Chile's protest action with similar upheavals around the world. 
In Lastarria, the most popular tourist area of downtown Santiago, a mural reinterpreting Pablo Picasso's celebrated Guernica features Pinera as a snorting bull, police special forces as horses, clouds of teargas, flames from burning metro stations and rubber bullets in the air.

A little further, a poster bears a picture of massive crowds, with words of promise, or of warning: ""Never again will they have the comfort of our silence.""

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 06:31AM ET</span>","Seeing without sight, my second encounter with a pope","By Mayuko Baba
TOKYO (Reuters) - When Pope Francis came through Tokyo this week, I got the chance to see my second pontiff and was surprised with a second blessing - both humbling but also very different experiences.
It may seem odd for me to say I've seen two popes, since I am blind. But I saw them, only without my eyes.
Blind since the age of four, I may not register visual images, but I see. I love birdwatching and even blog about it. My mind forms a tableau: I hear the birds singing, moving about, looking for food. It's a scene of imagination, a scene of feeling.
In the same way, I saw Francis on Tuesday after his speech at Sophia University. As he walked by, I reached out my hand and it touched his vestments - they were fluffy, with air rustling through them. He shook my hand and then gently patted my head, as one might to a child. It was like being wrapped in warm air.
I said ""Gracias, gracias,"" and he was gone.
In the enormous Tokyo Dome on Monday and at the university on Tuesday, I was struck by the gentleness Francis projected, in contrast with the power I had felt when I saw Pope John Paul II at the Vatican 20 years ago, who also graced me with his touch.
On Monday, it was quieter than I expected in a stadium used for rock concerts and baseball games. He led 50,000 people into silent contemplation, with only the occasional sound of a baby crying.
My encounter with John Paul, by contrast, was overpowering.
After an hour of prayers and hymns in the Paul VI audience hall near St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ), John Paul greeted each group, telling ours: “Kami ni kansha” – Thanks be to God.
Pressed against a rail at the front, I reached out as he approached. When he came to me, he held my head strongly between his hands and blessed me with a kiss on my forehead.
I felt a jolt of energy. I thought I might fall over backward. I started to cry. I didn't know why - I wasn't sad, I was happy. Later, as I reflected on that moment, I felt it was beyond my control - that it was God's power, God's presence.
That day, I became a pope-watcher. A year later I was baptized, becoming one of just half a million Catholics in Japan.
I was a student when I went to the Vatican. This week I was working. A translator at Reuters for 26 years, I was thankful for the personal connection with John Paul that made me part of the team organized to cover Francis's visit.
Francis seems more of a philosopher than John Paul, who could speak the language of politics with strength and clarity.
In his mass, Francis spoke of ""the many people who are socially isolated,"" and who are ""enclosed and even asphyxiated."" He spoke of a community that accepts the imperfect as worthy. ""Is a disabled or frail person not worthy of love?"" he asked.
He was speaking for people like me.
While Japanese people are famously kind - strangers are always helping me on crowded commuter trains - many people here are marginalized.
When I was a child, disabled students were not integrated into society. And when I got my master's degree, I was refused job interviews with more than 100 companies because of my disability.
Francis's call to abolish nuclear weapons in the only country upon which they have been used attracted the most headlines from this visit. But I also hope I will live to see his message of defending the vulnerable take firmer hold in Japan."

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's military began a rare court martial of soldiers on Tuesday following a probe into alleged atrocities during a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, a spokesman said, as the country prepares to face genocide charges at an international court in the Hague.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled to neighboring Bangladesh to escape a Myanmar military offensive launched in August 2017 that U.N. investigators described as having been executed with genocidal intent.
Soldiers, police, and Buddhist villagers are alleged to have razed hundreds of villages in the remote western Rakhine state, torturing Rohingya as they fled, carrying out mass-killings and gang-rapes.
Myanmar says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign against militants who attacked security posts.
Spokesman Zaw Min Tun told Reuters via telephone that soldiers and officers from a regiment deployed to Gu Dar Pyin village, the site of an alleged massacre of Rohingya, were “weak in following the rules of engagement”.
In a statement published on its website, the army said the soldiers being court martialed were involved in “accidents” in Gu Dar Pyin.
The Associated Press reported the existence of at least five mass graves in the village, through interviews with survivors in refugee camps in Bangladesh and time-stamped cellphone videos. Myanmar denied the allegations made in the AP report.
The country is facing a wave of international pressure over its treatment of the Rohingya, with cases filed against it at courts around the world.
Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of a Nobel peace prize for her past defiance of a military junta that had led the country for decades, is set to travel to the Hague for hearings starting in December at the International Court of Justice.
Gambia, a tiny, mainly Muslim West African state, lodged a lawsuit accusing the country of genocide after winning the support of the 57-nation Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
Myanmar says the international efforts violate its sovereignty and has vowed to carry out its own investigations into the allegations.
But few have been punished so far. Seven soldiers jailed for 10 years for killing 10 Rohingya men and boys in the village of Inn Din were granted early release last November, after serving less than a year in prison.
Two Reuters journalists who uncovered the murders spent more than 16 months behind bars on charges of obtaining state secrets, before being released in a presidential amnesty in May."
1542,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 05:55AM ET</span>",Erdogan says Qatar backs Turkey's plans to settle Syrian refugees: NTV,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Qatar could support Turkey's plans to settle more than a million Syrian refugees in northeast Syria after its offensive against Kurdish militia in the region, broadcaster NTV quoted President Tayyip Erdogan as saying on Tuesday.
Turkey launched a military incursion against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia last month, seizing a 120-km strip of land along its southeastern border.
Since launching its offensive, Turkey has urged Western allies to back its plans to build new towns in northeast Syria, where it says up to half of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it currently hosts could be settled.
It has called for an international donors summit to back the plan. Western officials say they would be reluctant to fund any project which involved involuntary returns or changes to Syria's demographics - something Ankara denies it is planning.
Speaking to reporters on his return flight from a visit to Doha, Erdogan said he presented his plans to Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, adding that ""Mr Tamim liked our projects"", according to NTV.
Asked whether Qatar will help fund the plans, Erdogan said: ""They are at the point of: 'We can carry out these efforts together'. There really isn't another way.""
Qatar's Red Crescent Society said last week it had opened a housing project in partnership with Turkey's AFAD emergency relief authority near the northern Syrian city of Al Bab, which Turkish-backed forces seized from Islamic State two years ago.
Relations between Turkey and Qatar have been close in recent years. Ankara supported Doha after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of funding militant groups. Doha denies the charge.
Erdogan said that he had also presented the plans to Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that he would renew his call for a donors meeting at the NATO summit in London next week. He said that realizing the plans would be ""an example to the world"".
The Turkish offensive was met by a chorus of criticism from Ankara's Western allies, who say the operation may hinder the fight against Islamic State. Turkey has rejected those concerns and said it will continue fighting militants.
Ankara views the YPG, the main component of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as a terrorist group because of its link to Kurdish insurgents on its own soil. It has been infuriated with U.S. support for the group, and has repeatedly urged its allies to stop backing the militia."

PARIS (Reuters) - Thirteen French soldiers were killed in Mali when their helicopters collided at low altitude as they swooped in to support ground forces engaged in combat with Islamist militants, the French army said on Tuesday.
It was the biggest loss of French troops in a single day since an attack in Beirut 36 years ago when 58 soldiers died. 
The ground commandos had been tracking for several days a band of militants moving on pick-up trucks and motor-bikes. After identifying the group on Monday, the Tiger and Cougar helicopters were sent to reinforce, along with a combat jet.
""In all likelihood, it was a collision between these two helicopters at low altitude that caused the accident,"" the armed forces ministry said. ""They were supporting commandos from the Barkhane force who were engaged with armed terrorists,"" the ministry said in a statement.
France, the former colonial power in the region, first intervened in Mali in 2013 to drive out militants who had occupied the north. It still has a 4,500-strong Barkhane force countering insurgencies in the wider region.
Rather than stabilising, security has progressively worsened.
Islamist militants with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have strengthened their foothold across the arid region, making large swathes of territory ungovernable and stoking ethnic violence, especially in Mali and Burkina Faso.
The deaths were announced by the office of French President Emmanuel Macron who expressed his ""deep sadness"" at the loss.
""The President of the Republic salutes with the greatest respect the memory of these soldiers,"" the Elysee Palace statement said. ""He bows to the grief of their families and their loved ones.""
Monday's deaths bring the total number of French soldiers killed in the Sahel region since 2013 to 38, according to officials in the defence and foreign ministries.
More than 200 soldiers from regional nations and international peacekeepers have been killed since September in Mali alone, with dozens more killed in Burkina Faso.
WE'RE NOT ""BOGGED DOWN""
The collision occurred at 19h40 local time, when darkness would have fallen over the area, as the helicopters manoeuvred ahead of engaging with the militants, the army said.
The two helicopters hit the ground a short distance apart. There were no survivors. 
Paris has maintained troops in the Sahel as part of Barkhane counter-terrorism operations, while western powers have provided funding to the regional G5 force made up of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania.
But nearly three years after its launch, the G5 Sahel remains perennially underfunded, hobbled by poor coordination and leaving much of the onus on Paris. 
The United Nations MINUSMA peacekeeping mission has also been based in Mali since 2013 and includes about 15,000 soldiers and police. 
France has been frustrated that it is taking the brunt of operations on the ground, although other European countries have provided logistical support, trainers and some special forces.
Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly told a parliamentary hearing on Nov. 20 that the French mission was not stuck in the region, but urged European partners to do more to support it.
""Europe is not immune to these security concerns, because if the Islamic State and al Qaeda branches were to establish themselves in a sustainable way in the Sahel, this would pose a security problem for Europe as a whole,"" she said.
""I do not think we are bogged down.""

Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism, and its dissent crackdown has shown signs of intensifying recently.
Nguyen Chi Vung, 38, was accused of ""making and spreading anti-state information and materials"" at the one-day trial at the People's Court of Bac Lieu province, in the Mekong Delta, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement.
It said Vung had held 33 livestream sessions on Facebook ""to share distorted information"" and ""encourage people to participate in protests during national holidays"".
Reuters could not reach Vung's lawyers for comment.
Vung will be placed under house arrest for two years after serving his jail term, the statement said.
The court's Tuesday decision came days after a music teacher in the central province of Nghe An was convicted of the same offences and jailed for 11 years.
Facebook is widely used in the country and serves as the main platform for both e-commerce and dissent. Facebook said in May it increased the amount of content it restricted access to in Vietnam by more than 500% in the last half of 2018.
The ministry said in a separate statement on Tuesday that police in Nghe An have arrested a 23-year-old man accused of smearing the image of Ho Chi Minh and spreading anti-state propaganda on Facebook.
Last week, police in Ho Chi Minh City arrested freelance journalist and government critic Pham Chi Dung, accused of ""anti-state"" propaganda."

GENEVA (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions surged to a record level last year and world temperatures could rise by more than twice the globally agreed warming limit if nothing is done, a U.N. report showed on Tuesday.
The ""Emissions Gap Report"" is one of several studies released ahead of U.N. climate talks in Madrid next week aimed at spurring world leaders to limit climate change. 
It measures the amount of emissions cuts needed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, as agreed in the key 2015 Paris Agreement. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year warned of huge global changes if that target is not met, such as the loss of nearly all coral reefs and most Arctic sea ice.
Under current national pledges to cut emissions, ""temperatures can be expected to rise by 3.2C this century, bringing wide-ranging and destructive climate impacts,"" said a summary of the report by the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP).
""Being a grandfather - we don't want to leave that for our grandkids,"" the report's lead author John Christensen told a news conference.
The report said the safest temperature threshold set in Paris - of 1.5C - was still achievable, but would require emissions cuts of 7.6% a year between 2020-2030, the report said. Limiting the rise to 2C it would mean annual cuts of 2.7%.
""We are talking about transformational change now - incremental change simply will not make it. We simply need to transform societies in the next 10 years,"" Christensen said.
""The longer you wait, the more difficult it becomes."" 
The report showed that emissions, including those from land-use change such as deforestation, had not yet peaked and rose to a record 55.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018.
Christensen said some of those that had met their targets comfortably, such as Turkey and Russia, should tighten them significantly.
The report named the United States as one of several large emitters alongside Brazil and Japan falling short of its own targets, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This month, the Trump administration filed paperwork to quit the Paris Agreement in the first step of a formal withdrawal process.
Countries face a 2020 deadline to set more ambitious emissions cut pledges.

""Had we done it 10 years ago, it would have been easier,"" said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. ""But the time is now and the opportunity is now.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended an extension of the term of office for the country's army chief, putting it on a possible collision course with the powerful military.
General Qamar Javed Bajwa was handed a three-year extension on Aug. 19, with the office of Prime Minister Imran Khan citing tension with neighboring India over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
Khan's government has enjoyed good relations with the military, in contrast to the tensions between the civilian government and army under the party of his predecessor and rival Nawaz Sharif.
During Bajwa's tenure the military has been accused by opposition politicians of electoral manipulation that helped Khan to power last year.
The military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half its 72-year history and takes the lead in setting security and foreign policy, has always denied interfering in politics.
In a hearing to validate Bajwa's extension on Tuesday, Pakistan's Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa said the court was suspending the decision until the army produced detailed arguments on its reasoning.
""If the (regional security) situation is so then the army as a whole body can deal with the situation, not the individual,"" Khosa said. ""If this criteria is allowed than every individual in the army can demand an extension on the same grounds.""
Under Pakistan's constitution, the army chief of staff usually serves a three-year term. Since the role was established in 1972, only one general has had his term extended by a civilian government.
If the extension is blocked by the court, Bajwa's term will end on Friday. Khosa issued notice for a representative of the military to appear in court on Wednesday.
A military spokesman declined to comment."

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 04:07AM ET</span>",Taiwan presidential challenger's wife skips Singapore after being told no campaigning,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - The wife of Taiwan's main opposition candidate in a presidential election has canceled a campaigning trip to Singapore after the government said it did not permit ""foreign political activities"".
Singapore, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory and simply a province with no right to foreign relations.
But Singapore does have close informal ties with Taiwan, including militarily, and was the site in 2015 for a landmark meeting between China's President Xi Jinping and Taiwan's then-president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Lee Chia-fen, the wife of Han Kuo-yu from Taiwan's Kuomintang party, which favors close ties with China, had been due in Singapore this week to stump for support for her husband from Taiwanese electors in the island state. Media in Singapore estimate there are around 50,000 Taiwanese living there.
The Kuomintang said on Tuesday that her trip had been called off altogether, having already said on Monday that it had canceled what would have been a rare high-profile overseas election event after Singapore's government had expressed concern about security.
Singapore's Foreign Ministry, responding to what it called questions ""regarding reports on the cancellation of a visit to Singapore by the spouse of a politician from Taiwan"", said foreign political activities were not allowed.
""The government does not permit the conduct of foreign political activities, including campaigning and fund raising, in Singapore. We have consistently maintained the same policy for all parties,"" it said in a statement.
""We expect all residents and visitors to respect and abide by our laws.""
However, other countries in the region which also have large Taiwanese business communities have welcomed Lee, including Cambodia, a close Chinese ally that does not even permit Taiwan to have a representative office there.
Lee has also been to Vietnam and Japan to drum up support, and is now in Malaysia. Her husband is far behind in opinion polls.
The Kuomintang, which used to rule China until it was forced to flee to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, says it wants to improve relations with Beijing.
Han this month called for a return to a consensus with Beijing that there is only one China, but rejected China's formula for Hong Kong-style ""one nation, two systems"" unification.
China has also previously allowed the Kuomintang to conduct low-key campaigning amongst the large Taiwanese business community in China, hoping they will go home to vote and usher in a government more well disposed toward Beijing.
China is deeply suspicious of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and her ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, fearing it wishes to push for the island's formal independence, crossing a red line for Beijing."
1551,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 03:52AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China sets up Hong Kong crisis center in mainland, considers replacing chief liaison","By Keith Zhai, James Pomfret and David Kirton
HONG KONG/SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Tightening control over efforts to manage the upheaval in Hong Kong, the Chinese leadership has set up a crisis command center on the mainland side of the border and is considering replacing its official liaison to the restive semi-autonomous city, people familiar with the matter said.
As violent protests roil Hong Kong, top Chinese leaders in recent months have been managing their response from a villa on the outskirts of Shenzhen, bypassing the formal bureaucracy through which Beijing has supervised the financial hub for two decades.
Ordinarily, communications between Beijing and Hong Kong are conducted through a Chinese government body: the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong. The Liaison Office is housed in a Hong Kong skyscraper stacked with surveillance cameras, ringed by steel barricades and topped by a reinforced glass globe. 
In a sign of dissatisfaction with the Liaison Office's handling of the crisis, Beijing is considering potential replacements for the body's director, Wang Zhimin, two people familiar with the situation said. Wang is the most senior mainland political official stationed in Hong Kong.
The office has come in for criticism in Hong Kong and China for misjudging the situation in the city. ""The Liaison Office has been mingling with the rich people and mainland elites in the city and isolated itself from the people,"" a Chinese official said. ""This needs to be changed.""
The Liaison Office may face increased pressure after city voters delivered a resounding defeat to pro-Beijing parties in local district elections on Sunday. Pro-democracy candidates won almost 90 percent of the seats, securing their first ever majority after running a campaign against Beijing's perceived encroachments on Hong Kong's liberties.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office in Hong Kong called the report ""false"", without elaborating, in a statement posted on its website Tuesday. ""No matter how the situation in Hong Kong changes, the Chinese government's determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests is unwavering,"" it said.
The statement said China was committed to the ""one country, two systems"" policy that governs Hong Kong’s affairs, and was opposed to ""external forces"" interfering in the city's affairs.
The State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the Liaison Office in Hong Kong did not reply to faxed requests for comment. The office of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam declined to comment for this story.
BAUHINIA VILLA
The crisis center is located at the secluded Bauhinia Villa, a property owned by the Hong Kong Liaison Office, according to sources and official media, and named after the orchid that adorns the Hong Kong flag and currency. The villa, located just across Hong Kong's border with the mainland, has served as a crisis center before: Senior Chinese officials stayed at the resort during the pro-democracy ""Occupy Central"" protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2014.
Top mainland officials have been gathering at the leafy compound to plot strategy and issue instructions aimed at defusing the crisis, according to six people familiar with the matter. Beijing authorities have been summoning key Hong Kong officials to meet at the villa during the five months of the increasingly violent anti-government protests, the sources said. 
Among those who have attended, two of the people said, is embattled city leader Carrie Lam, who in September dramatically scrapped the controversial extradition bill that had ignited the protests, with approval by China's top leadership. Hong Kong police officials, business leaders and local pro-Beijing politicians have been summoned to the villa as well.
In an indication of the operation's importance, Chinese President Xi Jinping is receiving daily written briefings from Bauhinia Villa, said two officials and another person familiar with the operation.
The mainland Chinese and Hong Kong officials interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter.
A Shenzhen businessman with close ties to Chinese officials described the villa complex as a ""frontline command center"" that authorities are using as a base for coordinating and monitoring the Hong Kong situation in a secure environment. The complex is ""packed with people,"" the businessman said. 
The establishment of the Shenzhen villa as a crisis center with a channel to top leader Xi points to the gravity and delicacy of the situation in Hong Kong, diplomats said. 
Mass protests erupted in June over an extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent for trial to the mainland, where justice is controlled by the ruling Communist Party. Beijing wants to restore order in the city, but without being seen to be calling the shots. 
Though the extradition bill has been killed, the protests have grown angrier, powered by a broad perception that Beijing is meddling improperly in city affairs and by complaints of police brutality. Hong Kong is governed under a charter which grants British-style rule of law until 2047, and its high degree of autonomy is widely seen as key to its prosperity as an international financial hub. 
City and mainland officials say the police response has been measured and that any violence has been initiated by extreme protesters. 
The lakeside setting of the villa, in a wooded neighborhood, enables Beijing and Hong Kong officials to meet away from the glare of the Hong Kong media and the chaos of the city's protest-clogged streets.
'PARALLEL HEADQUARTERS'
The use of Bauhinia Villa to manage the crisis sets up a supplementary channel to the system Beijing put in place to oversee Hong Kong after China regained control of the city from Britain in 1997.
The Liaison Office, which reports to China’s State Council, has long served as the platform for Beijing to radiate its influence in the city. The office fosters relationships with the Hong Kong government as well as establishment figures and an array of pro-Beijing and youth groups, including business and clan associations from Chinese provinces and regions.
""The Hong Kong situation has increasingly made Beijing authorities uncomfortable,"" said Sonny Lo, a veteran Hong Kong political commentator. Their desire for security and discretion, he said, is ""the reason they select Shenzhen rather than Hong Kong as a kind of parallel headquarters in dealing with the Hong Kong crisis.""
Senior Chinese officials initially tried to find a middle ground between not capitulating to the demands of the protesters, while trying to avoid a bloody crackdown that could damage the city's stature as a business center, according to three of the people familiar with the Bauhinia operation. Beijing sought to give the impression it wasn't intervening in Hong Kong even after a million people took to the streets on June 9, the people said.
Shortly after that show of mass defiance, however, the senior-most Chinese leader in charge of Hong Kong affairs took action. That official, Vice Premier Han Zheng, authorized Lam to communicate directly with his office, rather than going through the Liaison Office, according to a person briefed on the matter, effectively establishing a hotline. 
Subsequently, vice minister-level officials with China's Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State Security, the Cyberspace Administration of China and other departments all visited the villa, three of the sources said, an indication of just how seriously Beijing took the situation.
The two most senior Chinese leaders overseeing Hong Kong have been using Bauhinia Villa to deal more closely with the local leaders of the restive city, while remaining behind the scenes.
One is Zhang Xiaoming, the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which sits under China's top policy making body, the State Council. He has been a regular presence at the villa during the crisis, according to two sources who met with him there. A third person who met Zhang at Bauhinia Villa said Zhang spoke in detail about the now-shelved extradition bill and its importance, as well as subsequent attempts by Beijing to quell the unrest.
The other is Vice Premier Han himself. A day after Hong Kong protesters blocked access to the city's legislature on June 12, Han arrived at Bauhinia Villa and summoned Lam for a meeting, according to a person briefed on their discussions. Gathered at Bauhinia was a multi-departmental team of Chinese public security, cyber security and intelligence officers, as well as advisers on Hong Kong affairs, three sources said.
When Lam proposed a suspension of the bill at that meeting, Han agreed after talking with other leaders in Beijing, the person briefed on the meeting said. Lam then announced the suspension of the bill on June 15. 
The Liaison Office and senior pro-Beijing politicians in the city ""didn't know about the withdrawal until close to the decision,"" a senior Hong Kong official said.
BANYAN TREES AND BARBED WIRE
The concession didn't placate the protesters, who demanded a full and formal scrapping of the bill.
As the protests have persisted, Beijing has taken a more visible role in Hong Kong: Chinese aviation authorities called for Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways to suspend staff who supported or participated in the demonstrations, mainland paramilitary forces conducted exercises openly just across the border in Shenzhen, and China last week criticized a Hong Kong court ruling that overturned the city's ban on face masks used by protesters, rare interference in the territory's judiciary.
Bauhinia Villa has long been an outpost for mainland China's dealings with semi-autonomous Hong Kong. 
In addition to serving as a crisis center during the 2014 protests, the villa has been used as a low-key venue for Chinese officials to meet with city figures, with lodging facilities and ample space for conferences and events. Bauhinia Villa also has hosted delegations from the Hong Kong pro-establishment and pro-Beijing camps for training sessions and preparatory meetings before annual legislative sessions in Beijing. Another government-owned resort that hosts official functions, Kylin Villa, sits nearby.
Xi himself stayed in Bauhinia Villa before he took power in 2012 and planted a tree inside the lake-side resort. 

Security is tight, with checkpoints, spiked fences topped with barbed wire and numerous surveillance cameras. At the back is a steep tree-covered hill ringed with fencing, while on another side lies a conference center. A Reuters journalist was turned away recently when he approached the property.

Ankara has cracked down on suspected followers of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, since the coup attempt in which some 250 people were killed. Operations against the network are still routine.
Istanbul prosecutor's office said it ordered the detention of two civilians and 52 military personnel, including two retired colonels, a lieutenant colonel on active duty and two former majors who had already been expelled from the military. More than half of them were detained by early Tuesday.
Istanbul police said they had detained 15 of the 27 people for whom the prosecutors issued warrants in a separate investigation, over the suspects' use of ByLock, an encrypted messaging app used by Gulen's network.
In the central province of Konya, state-owned Anadolu news agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for 50 people. Anadolu also said that 36 soldiers were ordered detained by Ankara prosecutors, in addition to one civilian.
Gulen has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. He has denied any involvement in the coup attempt.
In the three-year purge since the coup attempt, more than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial and about 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from their jobs.
Turkey's Western allies and rights groups have criticized the scale of the crackdown, saying President Tayyip Erdogan has used the abortive coup as a pretext to quash dissent.
Ankara has defended the measures as a necessary response to the scale of the security threat which Turkey faces, vowing to eradicate Gulen's network."

The BDP was re-elected with 38 seats, but it faced a strong opposition challenge after former president Ian Khama fell out with President Mokgweetsi Masisi, his hand-picked successor, and backed The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) party.
Should the High Court rule in the UDC's favor and strip the BDP of 16 seats, the ruling party would be left with 22 seats and fall short of a majority in the 57-seat parliament.
""We have filed petitions in 16 parliamentary seats and five council positions over vote fraud. The challenge is mostly on the grounds of suspicion of double-voting by our rivals,"" Mohwasa said.
The UDC, a coalition of three parties, won 15 seats in the October election.
It was hoping to perform better than in 2014, when it got 18 seats, but an overwhelming win by the BDP in the southern part of the country, traditionally an opposition stronghold, ensured Masisi's party retained power.
Registrar of the High Court Michael Motlhabi said in a statement that election petitions were urgent and had to be tried and determined within 90 days. The UDC's petition would be heard by a panel of judges, Motlhabi said.
The BDP has ruled Botswana since independence from Britain in 1966, and the country has enjoyed stability and prosperity thanks to its plentiful diamond resources.
At his swearing-in this month, Masisi promised to drive a transformation of Botswana's economy, creating more jobs and countering excessive dependence on diamonds."

Risa Hontiveros filed a resolution warning of Chinese-engineered power and internet outages and interference in elections if safeguards remained absent, citing confirmation last week from a Philippine power executive that a ""hostile third party"" had the ability to cause blackouts.
Beijing and U.S. ally Manila have a long history of mistrust, despite Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's pursuit of warmer ties with China, largely concerning disputes in the South China Sea. Opinion polls consistently show Filipinos consider China an untrustworthy neighbor.
Ties were at their worst under the previous administration, when the Philippines infuriated China by seeking international arbitration over the conduct of its coastguard and its transformation of submerged reefs into de facto military installations.
Hontiveros said a country capable of aggression should not have the means to destabilize a neighbor ""with the flick of a switch"".
""Imagine a foreign country, which is an unrepentant trespasser and aggressor in our seas and territories, controlling our national electricity grid,"" Hontiveros said in a statement.
""It could sabotage our elections, shut down our access to television, the internet and other communication technologies, cause the collapse of our economy and undermine our national security,"" she said.
China's embassy in Manila did not respond immediately to a request for comment. There are no publicly known instances in the Philippines, or government accusations, of Chinese interference in its utilities.
Concern about China's involvement in the power grid was first raised on Thursday during the energy department's 2020 budget hearing in the Senate.
It also comes amid warnings by minority lawmakers that China Telecom's joint venture with Dennis Uy, a tycoon close to Duterte, could be a ""Trojan horse https://reut.rs/2NXdg9g"" for espionage. The consortium recently won approval to install communications equipment on Philippine army bases.

TIRANA (Reuters) - At least four people died after the most powerful earthquake to hit Albania in decades rocked the capital of Tirana and surrounding region early on Tuesday, causing several buildings to collapse and burying residents in the rubble.
The 6.4 magnitude quake struck shortly before 4 a.m. local time (0300 GMT), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, the second powerful tremor to hit the region in two months.
It was centered 30 km (19 miles) west of Tirana, at a shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), the USGS said. 
Two women were found in the rubble of an apartment building in the northern village of Thumane, and a man died in the town of Kurbin after panicking and jumping out of a building, a Defense Ministry spokeswoman said. 
A dead body, the fourth victim of the earthquake, was pulled out from under a collapsed building in Durres, the defense ministry confirmed. 
Emergency workers told local media one of those killed was an elderly woman who had managed to save her grandson by cradling him with her body. 
Unverified video footage posted on social media showed what appeared to be a collapsed building in Durres, 40 km west of Tirana, on the Adriatic coast. Other footage showed buildings with large cracks and fallen masonry, including one apartment with most of a bedroom wall missing. 
""Firefighters and army staff are helping residents (caught) under the rubble"", in Durres and the nearby village of Thumane, the Defense Ministry spokeswoman told reporters. 
An unidentified man, with a wound dressing on his right cheek, told News24 TV his daughter and niece were among those trapped in a collapsed apartment building in Durres. 
""I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone. They said they are well and are waiting for the rescue. Could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them,"" the man said.
Two government spokesmen told Reuters the biggest damage to buildings was in Durres and a few people had been taken to hospital in Tirana. 
A Reuters witness described residents fleeing apartment buildings in Tirana, some carrying babies. Power was down in several neighborhoods. 
Three hours after the main tremor, a strong aftershock rocked the city, which is known for its colorful mix of architecture from its Ottoman, Fascist and Soviet past.
Several smaller tremors were recorded in the hour before the main quake, which was also felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia.
""We were awake because of the previous quakes, but the last one shook us around. Everything at home kept falling down,"" Refik, a Tirana resident, told Reuters of what happened in his sixth-floor apartment. 
Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, between Greece and Macedonia, Albania experiences regular seismic activity.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.6 shook the country on Sept. 21, damaging around 500 houses and destroying some. The Defense Ministry had said it was the most powerful quake in Albania in the last 30 years.
The images of collapsed or semi-collapsed buildings in urban areas suggested Tuesday's quake was more powerful than one in 1979 which razed a neighborhood of the northern town of Shkoder, bordering Montenegro. Neither of those two earlier earthquakes caused any fatalities.

The Balkan nation is the poorest country in Europe, with an average income of less than a third of the European Union average, according to Eurostat data.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam acknowledged on Tuesday that the record turnout in local elections won by opposition, pro-democracy candidates highlighted dissatisfaction with her administration, while appealing for an end to violent protests.
Appearing tired and drawn, Lam spoke a day after results showed democratic candidates secured almost 90% of 452 district council seats in Sunday's elections, a landslide victory in polls that were widely seen as a barometer of the opposition to the Beijing-backed leader.
Hong Kong's most unpopular post-colonial leader acknowledged voters wanted to express their views on many issues, including ""deficiencies in governance"".
Speaking in measured tones, she thanked residents for voting peacefully and hoped the calm weekend was not just for the elections but a signal that residents want an end to unrest that has rocked the Chinese-ruled city for six months.
""Everybody wants to go back to their normal life and this requires the concerted efforts of every one of us,"" Lam said during her weekly address at the government's headquarters.
""So, as I have said repeatedly, resorting to violence will not give us that way forward. So please, please help us to maintain the relative calm and peace ... and provide a good basis for Hong Kong to move forward.""
Some observers say Lam, who came to power in 2017 on a platform to heal social divisions, is out of touch with the population and won't say anything concrete unless Beijing gives her the green light.
""There's no content in her talk, which is usual,"" said Ma Ngok, political scientist at Chinese University of Hong Kong.
""The majority of the people still support the (pro-democracy) movement so it is up to them (Beijing) to respond. If they don't respond with any kind of concessions, I think the protests would go on for some time.""
LULL IN VIOLENCE
The Asian financial center has enjoyed a rare lull in violence for nearly a week, breaking from six months of often violent anti-government unrest that has plunged the city into its biggest political crisis in decades, creating the greatest internal challenge yet faced by China's President Xi Jinping.
As demonstrations roil Hong Kong, the Chinese leadership has set up a crisis command center on the mainland side of the border and is considering replacing its official liaison to the restive semi-autonomous city, people familiar with the matter said.
Protests have sprung up on an almost daily basis since June, with flash mobs often gathering with little or no notice, at times forcing the government, businesses, schools and even the city's international airport to close.
The violence had escalated up to last week, with protesters hurling petrol bombs and firing arrows at police who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time. Police say they have shown restraint in the face of potentially deadly attacks.
While calm has descended across most of the city, a small group of protesters remain holed up in Polytechnic University, surrounded by police following extreme clashes in the run-up to elections.
Lam urged the protesters at the sprawling campus on Kowloon peninsula to leave peacefully as soon as possible.
University authorities estimate as many as 50 protesters may be hiding, too frightened to attempt an escape. Some protesters' estimates were lower, suggesting just a handful remain.
The anti-government demonstrations bolstered support for democrats in Sunday's elections, with a record three million people casting their vote.
The pro-democracy parties overwhelming victory poses a conundrum for Beijing and piles pressure on Lam, who is facing renewed calls to step down. The democrats took control of 17 out of 18 district councils.
A full-page advertisement on Tuesday in Hong Kong's Sing Pao newspaper by a ""group of voters who safeguard Hong Kong's future"" read: ""In the past five months, the public demands have been clear. Carrie Lam, what have you heard? What have you changed? Do not dwell on empty talks about deep reflection, resignation is the only result."""

The ministry said in a notice posted on its website Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang pressed the United States ""to correct its errors and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's internal matters"".
Anti-government demonstrators have protested in the streets of Hong Kong for more than five months amid increasing violence and fears that China will ratchet up its response to stop the civil disobedience.
The protesters are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to Hong Kong when Britain handed it back to China in 1997.
The U.S. House of Representatives sent the bills to the White House on Wednesday after voting 417 to 1 for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which the Senate had passed unanimously the day before.
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign that bill and one other relating to Hong Kong into law, despite delicate trade talks with Beijing.
Zheng said the passage of the Human Rights and Democracy Act was a form of encouragement of the violence and constituted a serious violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.
""China expresses its strong resentment and resolute opposition,"" he was quoted as saying.
A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Hong Kong's autonomy, its adherence to the rule of law and its commitment to protecting civil liberties were ""key to preserving its special status under U.S. law"".
""As the United States Government has said repeatedly, the Chinese Communist Party must honor its promises to the Hong Kong people, who only want the freedoms and liberties that they have been promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a U.N.-filed treaty,"" the spokeswoman said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Pope Francis wrapped up a four-day trip to Japan on Tuesday by turning from the anti-nuclear message that was the backbone of his visit to other key campaigns of his, urging students to defend the earth and show greater compassion.
Nuclear disarmament has been a key theme of the pope's trip to Japan, a country not only haunted by the memory of the two attacks that ended World War Two but also alarmed by the nuclear program and missile tests of nearby North Korea.
But on Tuesday he turned to another message, telling students gathered at Sophia University, one of a handful of Catholic universities in Japan, that technology is worthless unless it is used to bring about a more humane and simpler society.
""For all the efficiency and order that mark Japanese society, I have sensed a yearning, too, for something greater: a profound desire to create an ever more humane, compassionate and merciful society,"" he said in his last event before departing for Rome.
Noting that Asian cultures are known for their love of nature, he urged them to fight for the future of the earth, echoing the major encyclical he issued in 2015 making environmental protection a moral imperative.
Francis, in the first visit to Japan by a pope for 38 years, also sought to address a growing sense of isolation in Japan despite its wealth.
Bullying remains pervasive in Japanese schools, as a group of young people described to Francis on Monday, and there is a growing number of people known as ""hikikomori,"" who refuse to leave the safety of their houses, sometimes for years.
""More and more we see that a person, a community or even a whole society can be highly developed on the outside, but have an interior life that is impoverished and under-developed, lacking real life and vitality,"" he said in remarks on Monday at St. Mary's Cathedral in Tokyo.
Japan's suicide rate, while improved, still remains high, and there has recently been an alarming jump in teen suicides.
Combating this ""spiritual poverty"" was something everyone was called to, Francis said.
""It means recognizing that the most important thing is not what I have or can acquire, but with whom I can share it.""
He also urged Japan accept more than the handful of refugees it does every year despite its falling, aging population.
""I ask you to extend the hand of friendship to those who come here, often after great sufferings, seeking refuge in your country,"" he said.
During his four days in Japan, Francis met with survivors of the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima as well as those of the March 11, 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, embracing a teenager forced to flee his home due to radiation.
He also said two Masses and met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Emperor Naruhito, to whom he described the deep impression made on him as a nine-year-old boy in Argentina by his parents' tears at news of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings."

Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) has been trying since April to take Tripoli, which is held by an internationally recognized government.
Haftar and the U.S. delegation, which included White House deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates, discussed ""steps to achieve a suspension of hostilities and a political resolution to the Libyan conflict,"" the department said in a statement. It did not say where the meeting took place.
""The officials underscored the United States' full support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Libya and expressed serious concern over Russia's exploitation of the conflict at the expense of the Libyan people,"" the statement said.
Haftar is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and most recently Russian mercenaries, according to diplomats and Tripoli officials. The LNA denies it has foreign backing.
On Nov. 14, the State Department - after a visit to Washington by Tripoli-based government ministers - called on Haftar to end the offensive.
""These frank discussions build on recent talks with Tripoli-based officials aiming to establish a common basis for progress between the parties on the issues that divide them, in the context of moving toward a ceasefire,"" the department said on Monday."

TBILISI (Reuters) - Riot police used water cannon to disperse protesters near Georgia's parliament on Tuesday and detained several activists, hours after thousands rallied in the capital demanding electoral system reform.
Demonstrators, who were standing at four locations in front of entrances to the parliament, were forced to disperse, although dozens gathered in one place in front of the parliament building.
Giorgi Vashadze, one of the opposition leaders, told reporters that several people, including one opposition politician, were detained by police.
Hundreds of police officers were then deployed to the scene.
Protesters were planning to block entrances to parliament and said they would not let lawmakers in for a session on Tuesday, but officials said that would not be allowed.
""If protesters violate the law, the state will act adequately,"" Mamuka Mdinaradze, a lawmaker from the ruling party, told reporters a few hours before police scattered the protesters.
Protests in the former Soviet country of 3.7 million people have been taking place for two weeks to push for a switch to fully proportional representation in an electoral system that currently also includes single-seat constituencies.
The change was scheduled for 2024 but the opposition is demanding it be brought forward, saying the rules benefit the Georgian Dream party, in power since 2012.
Almost half of current lawmakers were elected not by party lists but in single-mandate constituencies, most representing the ruling party.

Police also used water cannon on Monday last week to scatter protesters outside parliament, arresting 37 people. Detainees have been sentenced to terms ranging from four to 13 days in trials which the opposition called politically motivated.

The company, China Innovation Investment Limited, said on Monday executive director Xiang Xin and alternate director Kung Ching had been stopped at Taipei's main airport and asked to cooperate in a probe into Australian media reports about Chinese interference in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
The allegations were made by a Chinese asylum seeker in Australia, Wang Liqiang, who said he was a Chinese spy. China says the man is a convicted fraudster.
Wang said he was part of an intelligence operation working within China Innovation Investment to infiltrate Hong Kong universities and media with pro-Communist Party operatives to counter the territory's democracy movement.
The company said the reports were ""fictitious and forged"" and that Wang had never been an employee. Hong Kong has been rocked by months of anti-government protests.
Xiang and Kung were referred to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office on Monday night for ""further investigation on suspicion of violating the National Security Act"", the Central News Agency said.
They have also been ordered not to leave Taiwan, the report said.
The company did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Tuesday. It said on Monday the two had retained Taiwan lawyers but it was not immediately clear who they were.
Wang had also given details about Chinese efforts to meddle in Taiwan's political system and elections.
Taiwan, claimed by China as its sacred territory, is already on high alert for Chinese attempts at disinformation and intimidation ahead of Jan. 11 elections for the presidency and legislature."

LONDON (Reuters) - The poison of anti-Semitism ""sanctioned from the top"" has taken root in Britain's opposition Labour Party, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said in an article published on Monday, warning the ""soul of our nation is at stake"" in next month's election.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a veteran campaigner for Palestinian rights, has been dogged by criticism from members, lawmakers and Jewish leaders that he has failed to tackle anti-Semitism in the party despite a promise to do so.
""The question I am now most frequently asked is: What will become of Jews and Judaism in Britain if the Labour Party forms the next government? This anxiety is justified,"" Mirvis, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, wrote in an article for Tuesday's edition of the Times newspaper.
He said the response of the party's leadership as their supporters drove lawmakers, members and staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism had been ""utterly inadequate"" and claims the party was doing everything it could and had investigated every case were ""mendacious fiction"".
""It is a failure to see this as a human problem rather than a political one. It is a failure of culture. It is a failure of leadership. A new poison – sanctioned from the top – has taken root in the Labour Party,"" he wrote.
A spokesman for Labour, who are trailing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives in the polls ahead of the Dec. 12 election, said Corbyn was a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism.
""A Labour government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe,"" the spokesman said.
""We are taking robust action to root out anti-Semitism in the party, with swift suspensions, processes for rapid expulsions and an education program for members,"" he said.
Mirvis said that, while convention dictates that the chief rabbi stays away from party politics, challenging racism went beyond politics.
""How complicit in prejudice would a leader of Her Majesty’s opposition have to be to be considered unfit for office? Would associations with those who have incited hatred against Jews be enough? Would describing as 'friends' those who endorse the murder of Jews be enough? It seems not,"" he said.
""When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake."""
1571,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 06:36PM ET</span>","Clashes, gunfire in Lebanon in second night of violence: state news agency","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Clashes between supporters of Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, and Shi'ite groups Hezbollah and Amal erupted into gunfire in Beirut late on Monday, state news agency NNA reported.
The clashes marked the second consecutive night of violence linked to Lebanon's political crisis, threatening to tip largely peaceful demonstrations directed at the country's ruling elite in a more bloody direction.
A video posted by Lebanese broadcaster LBCI showed heavy gunfire around Cola bridge in Beirut. The source of the gunfire was not immediately clear. No injuries were reported.
In the southern town of Tyre, supporters of Hezbollah and Amal tore up protest tents and set them on fire, prompting security forces to intervene and fire into the air, according to Lebanese media.
The protests that have swept Lebanon since Oct. 17 are fueled by deep resentment for a ruling class seen as mired in corruption and having driven the economy into crisis.
Supporters of Amal and the heavily armed Hezbollah have occasionally sought to break up the demonstrations and clear roads cut off by protesters. They destroyed a main protest camp in central Beirut last month.
The groups were influential in the coalition government led by Hariri, who quit on Oct. 29 after the protests began. They had opposed Hariri's resignation.
In a statement, Hariri's Future Movement warned its supporters to refrain from protesting and stay away from large gatherings to ""avoid being dragged into any provocation intended to ignite strife.""
Groups of men on motorcycles, some waving Amal and Hezbollah flags, were seen roving streets in Beirut and Tyre, according to witnesses and videos broadcasted on Lebanese media.
Adding to tensions, two people were killed when their car slammed into a traffic barrier on a coastal road on Monday, sparking criticism from Hezbollah and others of protesters that have cut roads as a primary tactic to keep up pressure.
Lebanon is facing the worst economic strains since its 1975-1990 civil war."
1572,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 05:32PM ET</span>",U.S. House intelligence chairman says Trump impeachment report early next month,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine will enter a new phase shortly after Congress returns to Washington next week when lawmakers issue a report that could lead to impeachment charges against the president, the head of the committee leading the probe said on Monday.
U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said the panels involved in the impeachment probe would send a report to the House Judiciary Committee after lawmakers come back on Dec. 3 from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
In a letter to members of Congress, Schiff also said the report would include a catalog of White House refusals to cooperate with the inquiry, and that the Trump administration's failure to cooperate could form the basis of a separate article of impeachment - or formal charge of obstruction of Congress - against the Republican president.
""A dozen witnesses followed President Trump’s order to defy lawful subpoenas, and the White House, State Department, Department of Defense, Office of Management and Budget and Department of Energy have provided no documents in response to subpoenas,"" Schiff wrote.
""In fact, the Committees did not receive a single document from any executive branch agencies pursuant to our subpoenas,"" the Democratic lawmaker said.
Producing the report is a prerequisite for a possible vote in the Democratic-led House on articles of impeachment against Trump.
""The testimony and documents we have succeeded in acquiring reveal a fact pattern that is overwhelming, unchallenged, and damning,"" Schiff said in the letter.
WEEKS OF HEARINGS
The intelligence panel last week wrapped up two weeks of public hearings, after several weeks of closed-door witness interviews, in the inquiry, setting the stage for the report lawmakers are working on now.
Schiff said the probe was continuing, however, and investigators might hold further depositions or hearings.
If the articles of impeachment are approved, the Senate, controlled by Republicans, would then hold a trial on whether to convict Trump and remove him from office.
Republicans have shown little inclination toward removing Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020. Trump denies wrongdoing and he - and many of his fellow Republicans in Congress - have dismissed the inquiry as a sham, hoax or effort by Democrats to overturn the result of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
The inquiry centers on a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden as well as a discredited conspiracy theory promoted by Trump that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Hunter Biden had worked for a Ukrainian energy company.
Democrats have accused Trump of abusing his power by withholding $391 million in security aid to put pressure on a vulnerable U.S. ally to interfere in an American election by digging up dirt on his domestic political opponents.
Biden, a former U.S. vice president, is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 election.
After receiving the report, the Judiciary Committee could conduct more proceedings, including hearings. The panel would draft any articles of impeachment against Trump before they go to the full House for a vote.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's Constitutional Tribunal on Monday ordered the release of opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, jailed last year for alleged money laundering and receiving illegal contributions from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht.
The members of Peru's top court decided to release Fujimori by a narrow margin of four votes in favor versus three against, the body's president Ernesto Blume said at a press conference.
Fujimori has been serving an 18-month pre-trial sentence since October 2018 after prosecutors said she led a criminal organization and received millions of dollars from Odebrecht during her 2011 election campaign. 
She denies the accusations.
""The court has not passed judgment on the substantive issue in the case of citizen Keiko Fujimori, and has not declared her acquittal or condemned her,"" Blume said.
Fujimori is the daughter of the country's authoritarian ex-President Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes and graft.
The decision comes as the country prepares to hold legislative elections on Jan. 26 after President Martín Vizcarra dissolved Congress amid a battle with lawmakers over his anti-graft campaign. Keiko Fujimori's Popular Force party had held a majority in Congress before its dissolution.
Popular Force, a conservative right-wing group, has announced it will participate in the January elections, but Fujimori is not expected to take part.

(Reuters) - Two powerful storms packing heavy snows and strong winds are expected to sweep across the western half of the United States this week just in time to wreak havoc on the plans of millions of Americans traveling for Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday.
Starting on Monday evening, a storm will begin dumping more than a foot (30 cm) of snow as wind gusts reach 45 mph (72 kph)in an area from southern Wyoming to central Colorado.
The same storm will then drop 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) of snow as it moves east across Nebraska and Kansas and into Minneapolis on Tuesday before reaching the upper Great Lakes by Wednesday, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.
A second strong storm is expected to dump heavy snow on parts of the Pacific Northwest starting Tuesday night, with blizzard-like conditions in Oregon and Northern California, the NWS said.
""Everyone say a prayer to the Colorado weather gods that my flight doesn’t get canceled on Wednesday night,"" Evelyn Graham, a 26-year-old biology student at the California State University in San Marcos, said in a Twitter message. ""I wanna go home for Thanksgiving.""
Some 55 million travelers will fly or drive at least 50 miles (80 km) from their homes this Thanksgiving, according to the American Automobile Association.
In the western half of the country, dozens of winter storm watches and warnings were in effect, complicating the plans of many would-be travelers.
Forecasters and transportation officials in several states in the western half of the country were discouraging traveling on roads as blowing snow could cause poor visibility and make driving difficult.
Airlines and airports also warned travelers to check the status of their flight and to consider rescheduling as weather may disrupt service.
Hazardous weather is expected on the East Coast starting late on Wednesday and into Thanksgiving when wind gusts up to 45 mph are possible, the NWS said.
The wind could force the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City to ground its balloons. City guidelines prohibit the giant character balloons from being sent aloft if sustained winds exceed 23 mph and wind gusts top 34 mph, Macy's spokesman Orlando Veras said.
""We monitor the weather on a daily basis, but at this time, it is too early to make any determinations regarding the flight of the Parade’s giant balloons,"" he said.
The guidelines in New York took effect in 1998, a year after high winds whipped the Cat in the Hat balloon into a crowd of parade-watchers, injuring four."

Australian universities earlier this month pledged to consider any military ties that a higher education facility has when considering joint research projects as part of Canberra's drive to limit foreign interference.
Using open source data, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) said in a report published late on Monday that 115 Chinese universities have alleged links with military research, or human rights abuses – ties which should prevent Australian universities from partnering with them.
""There's a growing risk that collaboration with PRC universities can be leveraged by the People's Liberation Army or security agencies for surveillance, human rights abuses or military purposes,"" said Alex Joske, an analyst at ASPI.
Foreign students are worth about A$35 billion ($24 billion) a year to the Australian economy. Chinese students account for about a third of that figure and Australia is worried that China could use this position to gain influence over its universities.
Beijing has previously denied any improper activities, accusing Australia of adopting a ""Cold War mentality"".
Relations between Australia and China have been strained in recent years over Australian fears of Chinese activity, both domestically and throughout the Pacific region.
Tension between the two countries was further exacerbated when Reuters reported Australian intelligence had determined that China was responsible for a cyberattack on its national parliament and three largest political parties before the general election in May. China has denied the allegations."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two correctional officers accused of covering up their failure to check on financier Jeffrey Epstein before he hanged himself will face an April 20 trial date.
U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres scheduled the trial for Tova Noel and Michael Thomas at a hearing in Manhattan federal court on Monday. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty.
Epstein's suicide on Aug. 10, at age 66, came a little over a month after the well-connected money manager was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors say that Noel and Thomas, the only correctional officers on duty in Epstein's unit the night before he was found dead, failed to carry out checks on Epstein and falsely recorded that they had.
Epstein had been taken off suicide watch shortly before his death.
Thomas's lawyer, Montel Figgins, said at Monday's hearing that he would seek more information about the U.S. Department of Justice's ongoing internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death, saying that problems throughout the prison system could be important to the case.
After the hearing, he told reporters his client was a scapegoat.
""There's only two people charged, but for this to happen, the whole system had to fail,"" he said.
Jason Foy, a lawyer for Noel, declined to speak to reporters outside the courtroom.
Noel, 31, was charged with five counts of falsifying records, while Thomas, 41, was charged with three counts. Both were charged with conspiracy.
Epstein's friends once included U.S. President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew. He previously avoided federal prosecution for sex crimes in a 2007 plea deal that has been widely criticized as too lenient.

His $577 million estate is now the target of civil lawsuits by more than a dozen women who say he sexually abused them in his homes in New York, Florida and elsewhere.

The protests began with a 250,000-person march last week and have been marked by widespread neighborhood ""cacerolazo"" demonstrations - a traditional Latin American protest in which people bang pots and pans.
Protesters of all ages have declared themselves against rumored economic plans such as a cut to the minimum wage for young people that Duque denies supporting. They have also highlighted what they say is a lack of government action to stop the murder of hundreds of human rights activists.
Duque has promised a ""great national dialogue"" focused on social issues and the fight against corruption to run through mid-March and invited citizens to submit proposals for how to improve Colombia. Duque's meeting on Monday was to be with business representatives as well as the unions which organized the original march.
Many protesters are also demanding the government fully implement a 2016 peace deal with Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels, which Duque unsuccessfully tried to modify.
Tactics used by riot police to disperse demonstrations, including the use of tear gas and sound grenades, have angered many, especially after 18-year-old protester Dilan Cruz was gravely injured on Saturday afternoon.
The protests have been largely peaceful, despite isolated looting in some areas and the institution of overnight curfews in Bogota and Cali.
The government has said three people were killed following Thursday's protests in incidents the police said involved looting. More than 340 police officers have so far been injured.
Colombia's migration agency said early on Monday it had deported 59 Venezuelans who were ""engaging in a series of activities that put public order and national security at risk.""
The agency said it respected the right to protest but refused to allow the actions of a few to affect security or generate xenophobia. There are some 1.4 million Venezuelans living in Colombia.
Duque's administration has been plagued by problems during his nearly 16 months in office, including a combative congress, low approval ratings and unsuccessful legislative efforts.
The protests have coincided with demonstrations elsewhere in Latin America, from anti-austerity marches in Chile, inflamed tensions in Ecuador and Nicaragua and protests over a fraught election in Bolivia that led President Evo Morales to resign."

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>",Special Report:‘Time to take out our swords': Inside Iran’s plot to attack Saudi Arabia,"By Reuters staff
(Reuters) - Four months before a swarm of drones and missiles crippled the world’s biggest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia, Iranian security officials gathered at a heavily fortified compound in Tehran.
The group included the top echelons of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite branch of the Iranian military whose portfolio includes missile development and covert operations.
The main topic that day in May: How to punish the United States for pulling out of a landmark nuclear treaty and re-imposing economic sanctions on Iran, moves that have hit the Islamic Republic hard.
With Major General Hossein Salami, leader of the Revolutionary Guards, looking on, a senior commander took the floor.
“It is time to take out our swords and teach them a lesson,” the commander said, according to four people familiar with the meeting.
Hard-liners in the meeting talked of attacking high-value targets, including American military bases.
Yet, what ultimately emerged was a plan that stopped short of direct confrontation that could trigger a devastating U.S. response. Iran opted instead to target oil installations of America’s ally, Saudi Arabia, a proposal discussed by top Iranian military officials in that May meeting and at least four that followed.
This account, described to Reuters by three officials familiar with the meetings and a fourth close to Iran’s decision making, is the first to describe the role of Iran's leaders in plotting the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-controlled oil company.
These people said Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved the operation, but with strict conditions: Iranian forces must avoid hitting any civilians or Americans.
Reuters was unable to confirm their version of events with Iran’s leadership. A Revolutionary Guards spokesman declined to comment. Tehran has steadfastly denied involvement.
Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York, rejected the version of events the four people described to Reuters. He said Iran played no part in the strikes, that no meetings of senior security officials took place to discuss such an operation, and that Khamenei did not authorize any attack.
“No, no, no, no, no, and no,” Miryousefi said to detailed questions from Reuters on the alleged gatherings and Khamenei’s purported role.
The Saudi government communications office did not respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon declined to comment. A senior Trump administration official did not directly comment on Reuters’ findings but said Tehran’s “behavior and its decades-long history of destructive attacks and support for terrorism are why Iran’s economy is in shambles.”
Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, at the center of a civil war against Saudi-backed forces, claimed responsibility for the assault on Saudi oil facilities. That declaration was rebuffed by U.S. and Saudi officials, who said the sophistication of the offensive pointed to Iran.
Saudi Arabia was a strategic target.
The kingdom is Iran’s principal regional rival and a petroleum giant whose production is crucial to the world economy. It is an important U.S. security partner. But its war on Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, and the brutal murder of Washington-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents last year, have strained its relations with U.S. lawmakers. There was no groundswell of support in Congress for military intervention to aid the Saudis after the attack.
The 17-minute strike on two Aramco installations by 18 drones and three low-flying missiles revealed the vulnerability of the Saudi oil company, despite billions spent by the kingdom on security. Fires erupted at the company’s Khurais oil installation and at the Abqaiq oil processing facility, the world’s largest.
The attack temporarily halved Saudi Arabia’s oil production and knocked out 5% of the world’s oil supply. Global crude prices spiked.
The assault prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to accuse Iran of an ""act of war."" In the aftermath, Tehran was hit with additional U.S. sanctions. The United States also launched cyber attacks against Iran, U.S. officials told Reuters.
The Islamic Republic has blamed ""thugs"" linked to the United States and other regional adversaries for orchestrating street demonstrations that have rocked Iran since mid-November, when the government hiked fuel prices.
Speaking at a televised, pro-government rally in Tehran on Monday, Salami, the Revolutionary Guards chief commander, warned Washington against any further escalation of tensions: “We have shown patience towards the hostile moves of America, the Zionist regime (Israel) and Saudi Arabia against Iran... but we will destroy them if they cross our red lines.""
SCOURING TARGETS
The plan by Iranian military leaders to strike Saudi oil installations developed over several months, according to the official close to Iran’s decision making.
“Details were discussed thoroughly in at least five meetings and the final go ahead was given” by early September, the official said.
All of those meetings took place at a secure location inside the southern Tehran compound, three of the officials told Reuters. They said Khamenei, the supreme leader, attended one of the gatherings at his residence, which is also inside that complex.
Other attendees at some of those meetings included Khamenei’s top military advisor, Yahya Rahim-Safavi, and a deputy of Qasem Soleimani, who heads the Revolutionary Guards’ foreign military and clandestine operations, the three officials said. Rahim-Safavi could not be reached for comment. 
Among the possible targets initially discussed were a seaport in Saudi Arabia, an airport and U.S. military bases, the official close to Iran’s decision making said. The person would not provide additional details.
Those ideas were ultimately dismissed over concerns about mass casualties that could provoke fierce retaliation by the United States and embolden Israel, potentially pushing the region into war, the four people said.
The official close to Iran’s decision making said the group settled on the plan to attack Saudi Arabia’s oil installations because it could grab big headlines, inflict economic pain on an adversary and still deliver a strong message to Washington.
“Agreement on Aramco was almost reached unanimously,” the official said. “The idea was to display Iran's deep access and military capabilities.”
The attack was the worst on Middle East oil facilities since Saddam Hussein, the late Iraqi strongman, torched Kuwait’s oil fields during the 1991 Gulf crisis.
U.S. Senator Martha McSally, an Air Force combat veteran and Republican lawmaker who was briefed by U.S. and Saudi officials, and who visited Aramco's Abqaiq facility days after the attack, said the perpetrators knew precisely where to strike to create as much damage as possible.
“It showed somebody who had a sophisticated understanding of facility operations like theirs, instead of just hitting things off of satellite photos,” she told Reuters. The drones and missiles, she added, “came from Iranian soil, from an Iranian base.”
A Middle East source, who was briefed by a country investigating the attack, said the launch site was the Ahvaz air base in southwest Iran. That account matched those of three U.S. officials and two other people who spoke to Reuters: a Western intelligence official and a Western source based in the Middle East.
Rather than fly directly from Iran to Saudi Arabia over the Gulf, the missiles and drones took different, circuitous paths to the oil installations, part of Iran’s effort to mask its involvement, the people said.
Some of the craft flew over Iraq and Kuwait before landing in Saudi Arabia, according to the Western intelligence source, who said that trajectory provided Iran with plausible deniability.
""That wouldn’t have been the case if missiles and drones had been seen or heard flying into Saudi Arabia over the Gulf from a south flight path” from Iran, the person said.
Revolutionary Guards commanders briefed the supreme leader on the successful operation hours after the attack, according to the official close to the country’s decision making.
Images of fires raging at the Saudi facilities were broadcast worldwide. The country’s stock market swooned. Global oil prices initially surged 20%. Officials at Saudi Aramco gathered in what was referred to internally as the “emergency management room” at the company’s headquarters.
One of the officials who spoke with Reuters said Tehran was delighted with the outcome of the operation: Iran had landed a painful blow on Saudi Arabia and thumbed its nose at the United States.
SIZING UP TRUMP
The Revolutionary Guards and other branches of the Iranian military all ultimately report to Khamenei. The supreme leader has been defiant in response to Trump’s abandonment last year of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly called the Iran nuclear deal.
That 2015 accord with five permanent members of the U.S. Security Council – the United States, Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom – as well as Germany, removed billions of dollars’ worth of sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran’s curbing its nuclear program.
Trump’s demand for a better deal has seen Iran launch a two-pronged strategy to win relief from sweeping sanctions reimposed by the United States, penalties that have crippled its oil exports and all but shut it out of the international banking system.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has signaled a willingness to meet with American officials on condition that all sanctions be lifted. Simultaneously, Iran is flaunting its military and technical prowess.
In recent months, Iran has shot down a U.S. surveillance drone and seized a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow channel through which about a fifth of the world's oil moves. And it has announced it has amassed stockpiles of enriched uranium in violation of the U.N agreement, part of its vow to restart its nuclear program.
The Aramco attacks were an escalation that came as Trump had been pursuing his long-stated goal of extricating American forces from the Middle East. Just days after announcing an abrupt pullout of U.S. troops in northern Syria, the Trump administration on Oct. 11 said it would send fighter jets, missile-defense weaponry and 2,800 more troops to Saudi Arabia to bolster the kingdom’s defenses.
""Do not strike another sovereign state, do not threaten American interests, American forces, or we will respond,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned Tehran during a press briefing.
Still, Iran appears to have calculated that the Trump administration would not risk an all-out assault that could destabilize the region in the service of protecting Saudi oil, said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit working to end global conflict.
In Iran, “hard-liners have come to believe that Trump is a Twitter tiger,” Vaez said. “As such there is little diplomatic or military cost associated with pushing back.”
The senior Trump administration official disputed the suggestion that Iran’s operation has strengthened its hand in working out a deal for sanctions relief from the United States.
“Iran knows exactly what it needs to do to see sanctions lifted,” the official said.
The administration has said Iran must end support for terrorist groups in the Middle East and submit to tougher terms that would permanently snuff its nuclear ambitions. Iran has said it has no ties to terrorist groups.
Whether Tehran accedes to U.S. demands remains to be seen.
In one of the final meetings held ahead of the Saudi oil attack, another Revolutionary Guards commander was already looking ahead, according to the official close to Iran’s decision making who was briefed on that gathering.

""Rest assured Allah almighty will be with us,” the commander told senior security officials. “Start planning for the next one.""

SACABA/LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivians have taken down roadblocks and struck peace deals after a month of protests and deadly clashes that have convulsed the divided nation following a disputed election in October and the resignation of long-term leader Evo Morales.
On Monday, hundreds of people in the city of Sacaba, one of the areas worst hit by violence, held a minute of silence for the 33 people who have died since the Oct. 20 vote. Most have been killed in the last two weeks.
But from the mountainous region of Cochabamba to de facto capital La Paz, signs are that the worst of the violence may be over as sparring politicians and civic leaders rallied to hold new elections and pull back from confrontation.
""We are returning to normal after something so hard and so dramatic, but I think we are moving forward,"" caretaker leader Jeanine Añez told reporters on Monday. Añez had on Sunday signed into law a bill to hold new elections.
Bolivia, led by Morales since 2006, spiraled into chaos after the October election was mired in controversy as evidence grew it had been rigged in the leftist leader's favor. Morales was eventually forced to resign amid widespread protests and after police forces and the military withdrew their backing.
Morales' Nov. 10 resignation, however, sparked a violent and volatile period as his supporters blockaded strategic routes to stop the flow of fuel and food to major cities and the military was mobilized on the streets against them.
The deaths since have raised pressure on Añez's interim government, with Morales backers blaming her for the violence. Añez and the military say they have not used excessive force and blame Morales, now in Mexico, for stoking the unrest.
""We have had many stumbles, but we hope that from now on we will move forward and have elections very soon,"" Añez added.
In Sacaba, where nine people died in clashes with security forces, a key coca farmer union boss and Morales ally told Reuters on Monday mobilized groups would now work to ""pacify the country and prepare for the next election"".
Andrónico Rodríguez said, however, that the interim government needed to also back down from its ""radical"" stance and repeated his view that Morales had been toppled.
""We maintain our firm position that the constitutional rule of our brother President Evo Morales has been usurped and forcibly interrupted,"" he said.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 01:43PM ET</span>",ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL: Shane? Ruth? Reporters go AWOL for UK's PM Johnson,"By William James and Kylie MacLellan
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain holds an election on Dec. 12, a political gamble by Prime Minister Boris Johnson who sees it as his best chance to break the deadlock in parliament over Brexit.
The parties are on the campaign trail, traveling the length and breadth of the United Kingdom to drum up support.
Following are some colorful snapshots from the election trail:
WHERE'S SHANE?
Johnson launched his Conservative Party's Welsh manifesto on Monday with a speech, including a word of two of the local language.
""Cyflawni Brexit,"" he said to applause, translating his well-worn campaign slogan ""Get Brexit Done.""
Having negotiated that hurdle, the subsequent press conference hit the buffers when he began taking questions from journalists.
Instead of calling on those in front of him with their hand raised, Johnson worked through a prepared list of reporters - a tactic that can ensure local and national press get questions and also weed out possible hostile enquiries.
""I'm going to go to Shane Brennon with the Daily Post,"" he said.
Silence.
""Is he here? Shane? Paging Shane? ... What rival event could Shane be covering today?""
Try again.
""Is Ruth here?"" Silence. ""No? Where is Ruth?""
Try again.
""Darryl Robertson from Wrexham.com, if Darryl is here?"" Silence. ""No? Right, OK.""
He gave up, and went for Sue, who had raised her hand to ask a question.
THERE'S ONLY ONE TONY BLAIR
Former British prime minister Tony Blair gave a speech at Reuters on Monday, warning voters that both Labour, the party he led, and their main rivals the Conservatives, could not be trusted to form the next government.
He advocated tactical voting to stop Johnson becoming prime minister, including voting for parties other than Labour in areas where that was the best chance to defeat a Conservative candidate.
So, who will Blair vote for?
""I've got to vote Labour,"" he said. ""I'm in a particular position: there's one of me ... I've been the longest serving Labour prime minister, I was leader for 13 years, I've been a member for 45.""
BRICKWALLING
Keen to address labor shortages, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited a college that trains construction workers, and had a go at laying bricks for the cameras.
As he concentrated on his trowel work, one reporter tried to engage him in small talk, with mixed results.
""Are you building for the future, Jeremy?"" asked ITV's Libby Wiener.
""We are indeed,"" replied Corbyn, without looking up from his wall.
Wiener tried again: ""Not worried your campaign's hit a brick wall?""
""That's a really poor joke, you know that? I'd have thought you could've done better than that. The campaign's going just great,"" Corbyn replied."
1588,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 01:24PM ET</span>",Iran stages pro-government rallies after days of violent unrest,"By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of Iran's clerical establishment rallied in Tehran on Monday, accusing the United States and Israel of instigating the most violent anti-government protests in at least a decade in Iran.
Amnesty International said on Monday it had recorded at least 143 protesters killed in anti-government demonstrations, which began on Nov. 15 after the announcement of gasoline price hikes. The protests have been the worst anti-government unrest in Iran at least since the authorities put down the ""Green Revolution"" of demonstrations against election fraud in 2009.
The government has blamed ""thugs"" linked to exiles and the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia for stirring up the street unrest.
Hossein Salami, the top commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, warned the United States and its regional allies not to push Tehran into devastating retaliation over what it sees as their support for ""rioters"".
""We have shown restraint... But we will destroy our enemies ... America, Israel and Saudi Arabia if they cross our red lines,"" Salami told pro-government demonstrators in Tehran's Revolution Square (NYSE:SQ), state TV reported. 
Iranian TV carried live footage of crowds chanting ""Death to America,"" and ""Death to Israel"". It and Iranian officials had promoted the state-sponsored rally since Sunday in response to Western statements of solidarity with the fuel price protesters.
""I recommend they (foreign countries) look at the marches today, to see who the real people in Iran are and what they are saying,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said.
The unrest has come as new U.S. sanctions imposed this year have cut off nearly all of Iran's oil exports, and as similar protest movements have erupted in Iraq and Lebanon against governments that include heavily armed pro-Iranian factions.
London-based Amnesty said Iran's ""use of lethal force against protesters"" must be globally condemned, adding that verified videos showed ""security forces deliberately shooting unarmed protesters from a short distance"". 
""In some cases, protesters were shot while they were running away and clearly posed no threat to the security forces. Other videos show security forces shooting towards protesters from rooftops of state buildings including a justice department building,"" it said in a statement. 
Iran's fuel protests have quickly turned political with protesters calling on top leaders to step down: ""Death to the dictator. Time for you to step down!"" protesters have chanted in social media videos posted by Iranians from inside the country.
Details have been difficult to report in part because of an internet blackout in much of the country.
LINGERING PROTESTS
State authorities warned ""rioters"" of severe punishment if unrest continued. They said late last week that disturbances had ceased, although unverified videos posted on social media after restrictions on internet access were partially lifted suggested sporadic protests were continuing in some places. 
Washington has sided with Iran's protesters, while France and Germany have expressed deep concern over reports of many deaths during the protests.
Social media footage has shown police on motorbikes driving into crowds and attacking protesters with clubs. Other videos showed police firing at people with live ammunition. 
Iran has rejected Amnesty's death toll figures. It says several people, including members of the security forces, have been killed and more than 1,000 people arrested. The Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group, said the number of arrests was probably closer to 4,000.

""My cousin has been arrested. We don't know where he is and whether he is alive or not,"" said a young protester in Tehran reached by telephone who asked not to be identified.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>",Trump ordered Pentagon to let convicted Navy SEAL keep elite status,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump ordered the Pentagon to let a Navy SEAL convicted of battlefield misconduct keep his Trident pin designating him as a member of the elite force, instead of holding a review board, his defense secretary said on Monday.
The disclosure by Mark Esper illustrates how Trump intervened repeatedly in the case of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, who was acquitted by a military jury of murdering a captured Islamic State fighter in Iraq, but convicted of posing with the detainee's corpse.
After restoring Gallagher's rank on Nov. 15, Trump on Sunday gave a formal order to halt the military's plans to hold a review board, Esper said.
""I spoke with the President on Sunday. He gave me the order that Eddie Gallagher will retain his Trident pin,"" Esper told reporters at the Pentagon, referring to Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher. 
Esper said he had been in favor of following the regular processes but stressed that, as president, Trump had ""every right, authority and privilege to do what he wants to do.""
Gallagher's case had been championed by conservative commentators, who argued he had been treated unfairly. Trump restored his rank earlier this month, when he also pardoned two Army officers accused of war crimes in Afghanistan. 
Critics had said such actions would undermine military justice and send a message that battlefield atrocities will be tolerated. 
Esper's comments were his first since he fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer on Sunday over his handling of Gallagher case.
Esper gave new detail about why he fired Spencer, saying the Navy chief had sought to cut a side deal with the White House that was ""contrary to what we had agreed to and contrary to Secretary Spencer's public position"" -- in which he appeared to favor allowing the military justice process to go ahead.
""We learned that several days prior, Secretary Spencer had proposed a deal whereby if the President allowed the Navy to handle the case, he would guarantee that Eddie Gallagher would be restored to rank, allowed to retain his Trident and permitted to retire,"" Esper said.
CAUGHT OFF-GUARD
Esper said he and Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had been completely caught off guard by Spencer. The Navy secretary, Esper said, had undermined everything Pentagon leadership had been collectively discussing with Trump.
Esper called Spencer and said he ""was completely forthright in admitting what had been going on."" Esper asked for Spencer's resignation letter on Sunday.
Esper's remarks contradicted what had appeared to be a principled stand by Spencer, laid out in his letter that suggested a split with Trump over the need to uphold the rule of law.
U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, suggested he still had questions about what happened to Spencer, who he called ""a good man, a patriotic American and an effective leader.""
""We have many unanswered questions about Secretary Spencer’s departure. The Senate Armed Services Committee must fully investigate what happened to ensure accountability,"" Kaine said.
Spencer's letter, seen by Reuters, took parting shots at Trump and defended the need to preserve ""good order and discipline throughout the ranks"" -- something Navy officials had believed the peer review board would help ensure.
""The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries,"" Spencer wrote.
""Unfortunately it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me."" 
Milley said on Monday that as far as he was concerned the Gallagher case was now closed.

""As far as I'm concerned, it is case closed now and it is time to move on and address the national security of the United States,"" Milley, the top U.S. military officer, told a small group of reporters during a trip to the Middle East.

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 01:13PM ET</span>",U.S. to start global entry program for Brazilian frequent travelers,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The U.S. government will launch a ""global entry"" program for Brazilians traveling to the United States to allow expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival, the Brazilian government said on Monday.
Brazilian business people who travel frequently to the United States have been waiting since 2012 - when the two sides were close to brokering a deal on it - for implementation of the trusted traveler Global Entry Program (GEP) to make their entry easier at U.S. airports.
The office of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's chief of staff said a global entry pilot program will start soon, with some 20 Brazilian executives initially to test the system's functionality.
Global Entry is administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and allows visitors to stop at a kiosk on arrival in the United States to have their fingerprints scanned and fill out a customs declaration form to enter the country.
Currently trusted travelers from Argentina, India, Colombia, Britain, Germany, Panama, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Mexico are eligible for the rapid entry program.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced his administration would take steps to enable Brazil to participate in the Global Entry Program when Bolsonaro visited the White House in March.
The U.S. Travel Association said Brazil's inclusion in the Global Entry Program was a good deal for both nations and would increase the number of Brazilians flying to the United States for shopping and vacation.
Since 2017, close to 2 million Brazilians have traveled to the United States annually, spending more than $7 billion per year, the association noted.
This year, Brazil eliminated the requirement of tourist visas for visitors from the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan, but Brazilians still need visas to enter the United States."

Vox's refusal to sign the declaration by the Madrid city council meant that for the first time since a landmark 2004 law on gender violence, local authorities in the Spanish capital were unable to issue a joint all-party statement.
This month's national election saw Vox become the third-largest party in the Spanish parliament, after more than doubling its number of seats with its mix of nationalist, anti-Muslim and anti-feminist rhetoric.
Javier Ortega Smith, a member of both Madrid city council and the national parliament said the declaration, on the United Nations' International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, addressed only one side of gender violence.
In a speech greeted by shouts of anger from the audience in the Madrid city hall, he condemned what he described as ""denialists"" on gender violence, adding: ""there are also men who suffer violence from women and are killed by their wives"".
The remarks were condemned by the mayor of Madrid, Jose Luis Martinez Almeida, from the center-right PP, whose conservative administration with the pro-business Ciudadanos relies on four Vox votes for a majority in the city council. ""It is not politics what you have done here today; it is political posturing,"" said Almeida. 
The PP's national leader Pablo Casado also tried to distance the party from their far right allies, urging other parties to ""join forces to fight against abusers"".
However there was an angrier reaction from civil rights activists such as Nadia Otmani, head of an association that helps migrant women deal with gender violence.
Otmani, wheelchair-bound for 20 years after she said her brother-in-law shot her as she tried to defend her sister, approached Ortega Smith in tears after his speech, crying: ""You cannot do this! You cannot play politics with gender violence!""
""Vox came mounting an important challenge to democracy and started with this one,"" said acting deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo, from the center-left Socialists.
According to official statistics compiled since 2003, 1,024 women have been killed in Spain by their partners as of Oct. 22. To date this year, 52 women have been killed. 

The latest victim, a woman in Tenerife, was allegedly murdered by her partner on Monday.

France has pushed for a European security alternative in the Strait of Hormuz after ruling out joining a U.S.-led coalition protecting oil tankers and cargo ships from threats they say Iran poses to shipping in the strategic waterway.
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on Saturday the initiative could start early next year and around 10 European and non-European governments would join, pending parliamentary approvals. She did not name the countries.
The Dutch government is expected to formally announce its contribution to the French-led mission on Friday, ANP said.
Denmark, Italy and Spain are among countries that have previously expressed interest in joining the French-led initiative.
The European-led maritime force is meant to ensure safe shipping in the Strait after tanker attacks earlier this year that the United States blamed on Iran.
Tehran has denied being behind the attacks on tankers and other vessels in major global shipping lanes off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in May that aggravated tensions between the United States, Iran and Gulf Arab states.
Britain, Australia and several Gulf states have so far joined the U.S.-led naval coalition."

The arrest warrant is part of a new phase probe called Patron targeting black-market money dealers. The Brazilian federal judge alleged tobacco magnate Cartes - Paraguay's president from 2013 to 2018 - helped an influential dealer Dario Messer before his arrest last July in Sao Paulo.
Cartes in a letter to Paraguay's prosecutor called on the body to investigate the case, which he said involved conduct that ""entirely"" took place within Paraguayan territory.
""I present myself and make myself available to the Public Ministry so that... the facts and behaviors attributed to my person are investigated and judged,"" Cartes wrote.
In the note, Cartes presents himself as a life senator and an elected senator, a status that would grant him immunity from prosecution. However, his status as a member of the Senate is widely debated in the country by politicians and judges.
The Patron operation has targeted money changers involved in corruption and bribery schemes of former Rio de Janeiro governor Sergio Cabral, who has been detained since 2017. Messer is considered a key player in that case.
Cartes, 63, is considered one of the richest men in Paraguay and remains politically influential. During his tenure he also made sweeping changes to the country's judiciary, including appointing the current head of the Attorney General's office.          "

This is the latest sign that President Paul Biya's attempts to foster national reconciliation have faltered, after peace talks in September were boycotted by separatists and opposition politicians.
Maurice Kamto, the head of the opposition Cameroon Renaissance Movement (MRC), called on other opposition parties, as well as civil society and religious groups, to join MRC in boycotting the elections on Feb. 9.
""The electoral code is tailored to allow the current regime to cheat and remain in power forever,"" he told a news conference.
Kamto has been mobilising dissent against Biya since losing what he says was a fraudulent presidential election in October.
Biya, who has governed Cameroon for nearly four decades, is seeking to calm unrest stoked by the vote as well as a separatist crisis that has cost 2,000 lives over the past two years.
Kamto was arrested in January after leading protests which security forces dispersed with live bullets, and faced insurrection charges before a military court.
He was released last month in what the government said was a gesture of national reconciliation.
The separatist revolt, which began as peaceful protests by English speakers against what they see as their marginalisation by the French-speaking majority, now aims to create an independent state.
It has emerged as the biggest security challenge of Biya's tenure, forcing half a million people from their homes."

The emailed statement from Johnson's government office said if there were to be a change of government after the Dec. 12 election, the plans could change.
Britain is holding an election three years ahead of schedule because parliament had become deadlocked over Brexit, unable to agree on how or even whether to leave the European Union.
Johnson's Conservatives are leading the opposition Labour Party in polls, but the election campaign has over two weeks to run, and is hard to predict because Brexit has blurred traditional party lines.
The plan to move swiftly to a ""Queen's speech"", in which Queen Elizabeth formally opens parliament and sets out the government's legislative plans, underlines Johnson's core campaign message that he wants to deal with Brexit as quickly as possible.

Johnson has pledged that before Christmas he will present parliament with legislation needed to implement a Brexit deal he has already agreed with Brussels.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's leader pledged to listen to public opinion on Monday after a landslide election victory by opponents of Chinese rule amid months of sometimes violent pro-democracy unrest.
Democratic candidates secured almost 90% of 452 district council seats in Sunday's poll, held during a rare weekend lull in clashes with police, despite a strongly resourced and mobilized pro-establishment opposition.
Hong Kong's pro-Beijing chief executive, Carrie Lam, said the government respected the results and wished ""the peaceful, safe and orderly situation to continue"".
""Quite a few are of the view that the results reflect people's dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society,"" Lam said.
The government would ""listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect"", her statement said.
The elections saw record turnout after six months of protests and brought upset wins for democrats against heavyweight pro-Beijing opponents, greeted in some voting centers by chants of ""Liberate Hong Kong"" and ""Revolution Now"".
While district councils deal with local issues such as transport, their members also form part of the election committee for Hong Kong's chief executive. This could give them some influence over the next vote in 2022, although they only account for 117 of its 1,200 members.
Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai described the election as the first step in the long way to full democracy. ""This district election shows that the central government needs to face the demands of a democratic system,"" he said.
Along with universal suffrage, the protesters' demands include an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality. 
The voting ended with no major disruptions across the city of 7.4 million people on a day that saw massive, though orderly, queues form outside voting centers.
""This is the power of democracy. This is a democratic tsunami,"" said Tommy Cheung, a former student protest leader who won a seat in the Yuen Long district close to China's border.
FIRST STEP?
Asked if the chief executive should consider her position in light of the election results, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing ""firmly supports"" Lam's leadership. Hong Kong's most urgent task was to restore order and stop the violence, Geng told a daily press briefing.
In self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, the presidential office expressed ""great admiration"" for the election result which it said demonstrated Hong Kong's will to persue freedom and democracy.
The number of seats held by the pro-democracy camp more than quadrupled and turnout, at 71%, was almost double the number in the previous polls four years ago.
Starry Lee, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, apologized for her party's performance. 
""For this major defeat, we do not want to find any excuses and reasons,"" said Lee. She said the party rejected her offer to resign earlier on Monday.
'PATH OF STRUGGLE'
Former student leader Lester Shum, who won a seat, said district councils were just one path to democracy. ""In future, we must find other paths of struggle to keep fighting,"" he said.
China's state-run Xinhua news agency announced the completion of the election, but did not say which side had won.
""Rioters, in concert with external forces, have continuously committed and escalated violence, resulting in social and political confrontation,"" it said. ""...Months of social unrest have seriously disrupted the electoral process.""
Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time. Police say they have shown restraint in the face of potentially deadly attacks.
Britain said it welcomed Lam's promise to ""seriously reflect"" on the result.
Jimmy Sham, a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized some of the anti-government rallies, won his electoral contest, while some pro-Beijing heavyweights, such as Junius Ho, a hate-figure among protesters for his abrasive comments, lost.
Ho described the outcome on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as ""an unusual result"" while his victorious opponent, political newcomer Cary Lo, expressed surprise and delight.
Sham and other democrats entered the Polytechnic University to urge police to end a standoff and allow humanitarian assistance to those few protesters trapped inside, with fears rising about their physical and emotional health. They left after meeting two protesters whom they were unable to convince to leave despite the now-dire conditions on campus.
""You can't rest well, you can't get proper food,"" said a man in his 20s, who asked to be identified only as Norym, clutching a cup of coffee from a kitchen filled with garbage.
The university is surrounded by riot police, after about 1,100 were arrested last week. Some were held during escape attempts that included trying to clamber down ropes to waiting motorbikes, with protesters throwing petrol bombs and police responding with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.
There was a small standoff between police and protesters outside the campus on Monday evening, with many shouting ""come out"" and hurling abuse at police.
The protests started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial but rapidly evolved into calls for full democracy, posing the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",Briton who drove truck in which 39 Vietnamese died admits plot,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British man admitted on Monday plotting to assist unlawful immigration after 39 Vietnamese migrants were found dead in the back of a truck he was driving.
The driver, Maurice Robinson, also pleaded guilty to acquiring criminal property but was not asked to enter a plea on 41 other charges including 39 counts of manslaughter in a case which has shone a light on the illicit human smuggling trade.
Robinson, 25, from the British province of Northern Ireland, was addressing a London court hearing from prison a month after the 39 bodies were found in the truck on an industrial estate in Grays, about 20 miles (32 km) east of London.
Thirty-one of the victims were men or boys, and eight were women. The oldest was 44 and three were aged under 18, including two 15-year-old boys. Most were from Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects and other factors fuel migration.
Many impoverished people from Asia, the Middle East and Africa make perilous journeys to western Europe in the hope of a better life, often after paying huge sums to criminal gangs.
Prosecutor William Emlyn Jones told Monday's hearing at London's Old Bailey criminal court that it was likely to be a large and complex case. 
Robinson admitted to having conspired with others between May 1, 2018 and Oct. 24 this year to commit an offence of assisting unlawful immigration, and to acquiring cash which he knew or suspected came from criminal conduct.
No trial date was set, and Robinson is next due in court on Dec. 13.
Another man from Northern Ireland, 23-year-old Christopher Kennedy, appeared at a separate hearing on Monday, charged with conspiring to arrange the travel of people with a view to their exploitation, and conspiracy to break immigration laws.
His case was also adjourned to the Old Bailey until Dec. 13.
A third suspect, Eamon Harrison, 22, also from Northern Ireland, has also been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter and human trafficking and immigration offences. He was arrested in the Irish Republic and the British authorities have started proceedings to extradite him.

Police in Vietnam have arrested 10 people in connection with the deaths.

The move indicated that investigators believe the man, named as Melvin Theuma, has given them solid evidence they can use in court to try to convict the person who ordered the killing.
Caruana Galizia, one of Malta's best-known investigative journalists, was blown up as she left her home on Oct. 16, 2017.
The murder shocked Europe and raised questions about rule of law on the Mediterranean island.
Three men are awaiting trial for setting off the bomb.
Theuma was arrested on Nov. 14 in a separate anti-money laundering case but offered to provide information on the 2017 murder of in exchange for a pardon. Local media reported that he has audio recordings and text messages to back his claims.
The police have not confirmed the reports or said what information he has handed over.
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said last week he would recommend a pardon if Theuma's evidence was corroborated and could stand up in court. A day after news of Theuma's arrest was leaked, police detained Yorgen Fenech, a prominent businessman regarded as a person of interest in the case.
Police sources said on Saturday that Fenech too had requested a pardon in return for information about the case.
A pardon is granted by the president on the advice of the government. A president cannot refuse to issue a pardon once it has been recommended by the government.
Theuma, 41, is a taxi driver who regularly worked at an apartment complex owned by Fenech. Previous court appearances have shown that he was also involved in many illicit activities, including running a secret, multi-million euro lottery and as a loan shark, offering loans at extremely high interest rates.
Neither Theuma nor Fenech have made any public comments since their arrests.
A trail-blazing journalist, Caruana Galizia regularly posted allegations of corruption on her blog and on various occasions targeted Fenech as well as members of the government, including Economy Minister Chris Cardona, Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi and Muscat's chief of staff Keith Schembri.
Police briefly called in Cardona for questioning on Saturday in connection with the case. He has denied any wrongdoing, as have Mizzi and Schembri.
Government lawmakers met on Monday to discuss the situation, with some calling openly for resignations to protect the reputation of the ruling Labour party."

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 10:06AM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court turns away murder case highlighted in 'Serial' podcast,"By Andrew Chung
(Reuters) - A Baltimore man will remain behind bars for the 1999 murder of his former high school girlfriend after the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected his bid for a new trial in a case that captured public attention after the podcast ""Serial"" raised questions about his prosecution.
The justices turned away an appeal by Adnan Syed, 39, who has been serving a life sentence since 2000 after being convicted in the strangling death of high school classmate Hae Min Lee. Maryland's highest court in March ruled out a new trial for Syed despite his attorney's failure to properly defend him.
Prosecutors said Syed killed the 17-year-old Lee in 1999 in the parking lot of a Best Buy store shortly after school, and then buried her body in a shallow grave later that evening. He was jealous, the state argued, because she had started dating someone else. Lee's body was found three weeks later.
There were no eyewitnesses to the murder but one witness said he helped Syed bury the body. A jury in Baltimore convicted Syed of first-degree murder and other charges in 2000.
In 2015, a state court reopened the case to allow Syed to argue that his initial defense lawyer had been ineffective because she failed to contact and interview a witness, Asia McClain, who could have provided a potential alibi. McClain had said she remembered speaking with Syed at the school library during the time prosecutors had said Syed killed Lee.
A new trial was ordered for Syed after a state intermediate appeals court said the attorney's incompetence resulted in impermissible prejudice to Syed's defense.
Syed's case won public attention in 2014 when it was the subject of the ""Serial"" podcast, produced by public radio station WBEZ Chicago and downloaded tens of millions of times. It has since inspired news articles and a documentary on HBO.
Last March, in a closely divided 4-3 ruling, the Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's top court, overturned that decision because the jury could have disregarded prosecutors' timeline for when Lee was killed, but still believed that Syed murdered her."
1604,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 09:43AM ET</span>",Chemical weapons body defends Syria attack conclusions after leaks,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The head of the global chemical weapons organization on Monday defended the agency's conclusion that poison was used in a high profile attack in Syria last year, after leaked documents suggested two former employees doubted some of its findings.
More than 40 people were killed in the April 7 attack in Douma, a town on the outskirts of Damascus that was then held by rebels.
The United States, Britain and France retaliated a week later by firing missiles at Syrian government targets, the biggest Western military action against the Damascus authorities of the eight year war.
Inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded in a report released on March 1 that a toxic chemical containing chlorine was used in an attack. The team was not mandated to assign blame for who used the toxic chemical.
However, the Syrian government and its Russian allies have rejected the findings, saying they believe the incident was staged by rebels and no attack had taken place.
On Saturday, anti-secrecy group Wikileaks published an internal email to the former chief of staff at the OPCW in which an unidentified inspector described a report as having been edited to appear more conclusive than the inspectors' findings.
""I am requesting that the fact-finding report be released in its entirety as I fear this redacted version no longer reflects the work of the team,"" the inspector wrote. An OPCW source told Reuters the June 22, 2018 email was genuine.
OPCW chief Fernandon Arias said the body stands by the findings it published in March this year.
""While some of these diverging views continue to circulate in certain public discussion forums, I would like to reiterate that I stand by the independent, professional conclusions"" of the report, he told delegates on Monday.
""The secretariat has, as it always does, considered and taken into account all information submitted,"" he said.
Douma is expected to be a major theme at the annual conference of the OPCW being held in The Hague this week.
Criticism of the OPCW's findings over the incident have been circulating since reports on pro-Russian and pro-Syrian media outlets cited another leaked internal document by a former OPCW employee named Ian Henderson in May.
Henderson, who helped the OPCW's team collect samples during a field mission to Douma, wrote that two cylinders found at the scene were most likely placed there rather than being dropped from the air.
The Syrian war has split the OPCW, once largely a technical organization, along political lines, with Russia and its ally Syria on one side and the United States, France and Britain on the other.
A United Nations-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) previously carried out the task of assigning blame for chemical weapons attacks, but Russia vetoed a resolution to extend its mandate beyond November 2017.
The JIM concluded in a series of reports that the Syrian military used both nerve agent sarin and chlorine as weapons, while Islamic State insurgents had used sulfur mustard gas on the battlefield.
A new agency unit, the Investigation and Identification Team, is looking into who was responsible for the Douma attack, against the wishes of Moscow and Damascus."
1605,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 08:48AM ET</span>","Greenhouse gases accelerate to new peak in 2018, U.N. says","By Emma Farge
GENEVA (Reuters) - Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a new record in 2018, exceeding the average yearly increase of the last decade and reinforcing increasingly damaging weather patterns, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Monday.
The U.N. agency's Greenhouse Gas Bulletin is one of a series of studies to be published ahead of a U.N. climate change summit being held in Madrid next week, and is expected to guide discussions there. It measures the atmospheric concentration of the gases responsible for global warming, rather than emissions.
""There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases' concentration in the atmosphere - despite all the commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.
""This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems,"" said a summary of the report. 
The concentration of carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels that is the biggest contributor to global warming, surged from 405.5 parts per million in 2017 to 407.8 ppm in 2018, exceeding the average annual increase of 2.06 ppm in 2005-2015, the WMO report said.
Irrespective of future policy, carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for centuries, locking in warming trends. 
""It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago,"" Taalas said.
""MORE HOPEFUL THAN I USED TO BE""
The annual increase in methane - a greenhouse gas that is more potent than CO2 but dissipates faster - was the highest since 1998, said the report, which includes data from dozens of sites as well as naval and aerial measurements.
For nitrous oxide, which helps to erode the atmosphere's ozone layer and expose humans to harmful ultraviolet rays, it was the biggest increase ever recorded. 
Asked about the Madrid talks, which begin on Dec. 2, Taalas said there were some grounds for optimism.
""What is good news is the visibility of these issues is higher than ever,"" he told journalists. ""So, personally, I'm more hopeful than I used to be 10 years ago, but of course we have to speed up the process."" 
The U.N. Environment Programme's (UNEP) annual ""emissions gap"" report, due on Tuesday, assesses whether countries’ emissions reduction policies are enough to meet agreed targets of limiting global warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 Fahrenheit).
Last week, a report co-authored by UNEP showed that major fossil fuel producers are set to bust global environmental goals with their coal, oil and gas extraction in the next decade.

Later on Monday, a majority of European Union lawmakers were hoping to symbolically declare a ""climate emergency"" during a debate on the Madrid conference, to increase pressure on the incoming EU executive to take a stronger leading role in the fight against climate change.

The eight include two wanted by Russia and one each from Denmark, Norway, Ukraine, Brazil, Cyprus and the United States.
Six of the cases involved murders, while sexual violence, grievous bodily injury resulting in death, abduction and rape were also among the charges.
Interpol said in a statement that one in two women killed worldwide was murdered by a partner or family member, while one in three women and girls experience violence in their lifetime.
""The appeal ... is a stark reminder of how women and girls universally experience violence and abuse across the world,"" it said, adding that the suspects were all subject to Interpol red notices, which ask authorities worldwide to detain subjects."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A Human Rights Watch (HRW) official complied with an Israeli expulsion order on Monday imposed over accusations he backs an international pro-Palestinian boycott, but said the edict would only encourage rights abuses.
HRW and Omar Shakir, a U.S. citizen representing the New York-based organization in Israel and the Palestinian territories, have denied the allegations.
Three weeks ago, Israel's Supreme Court upheld the Interior Ministry's refusal to renew Shakir's work visa and ordered him to leave by Nov. 25.
The ministry said Shakir actively supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Israeli law allows for authorities to ban the entry of foreign citizens who call for a boycott of Israel.
Shakir denies that his HRW work and pro-Palestinian statements he made before being appointed to the HRW post in 2016 constitute active support for BDS.
""If the Israeli government can deport somebody documenting rights abuses without facing consequences, how can we ever stop rights abuses?"" Shakir said at a news conference in Jerusalem on Monday before heading to the airport for his departure.
Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs, which is tasked with combating the BDS movement, welcomed Shakir's removal, calling him ""an active BDS propagator"".
""Israel, like any sane country, has the right to decide who is given the freedom to enter and work within its borders,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Shakir will continue in his role from neighboring Jordan, relying on a network of researchers in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to conduct field work, HRW's executive director Kenneth Roth said at the news conference.
""There's no point in replacing Omar because our next researcher would have the same problem,"" Roth said.
""If Israel can pick our researcher, Israel can preclude certain topics. Imagine what other governments will do. China will say we cannot monitor Xinjiang (detention camps). Saudi Arabia will say that we leave Yemen alone,"" he said.
Israel, Roth said, had joined the ranks of countries such as Iran and Egypt in blocking access for HRW officials.
Roth said Shakir was being punished in part for HRW's work calling for businesses active in Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank to cease their activities.
The United Nations considers settlements Israel built on land it captured in the 1967 Middle East as illegal. Israel disputes this and cites historical and biblical links to the territory, which Palestinians seek for an independent state.
HRW says it does not support boycotts of Israel but does defend the right of activists to engage in such non-violent protests."

Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, has seen growing state and public hostility towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.
The AGO's website listed criteria for applicants and said they could not have ""physical or mental disorders, including sexual orientation deviations and behavioral deviations"".
""We just want the normal ones,"" said Mukri, a spokesman at the attorney general's office, who uses one name.
""All religions still prohibit that kind of act,"" he said, adding that candidates who intended to become prosecutors needed to be tough and professional.
The agency also said applicants should not be colour blind, or have tattoos or piercings and put limits on their weight.
Indonesia's 74 ministries and state agencies, alongside 467 local administrations, started hiring for new civil servant candidates this month.
The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) said the restrictions were a violation of human rights.
""Everyone should be able to do their jobs without paying mind to their sexual orientations or gender identities,"" Beka Ulung Hapsara of Komnas HAM, said in a statement.
Homosexuality is not a crime in Indonesia, except in the ultra-conservative Islamic province of Aceh, but some religious groups have called for it to be banned. Many members of the LGBT community are not open about their sexual orientation.
In September, Arus Pelangi, an LGBT advocacy group, reported more than 1,800 cases of persecution of gay Indonesians happening between 2006 and 2017.
Police have taken high-profile actions against gay clubs and parties in the last few years including detaining scores during raids on gay saunas in Jakarta.
In May, a police brigadier filed a legal complaint after he said he was fired in Central Java for being gay.
An Indonesian city in West Sumatra also approved a bylaw last year to fine gay and transgender people up to 1 million rupiah ($70) for behaviour that could ""disturb public order"" or be considered immoral."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Istanbul's new mayor has said Turkey's state banks stopped making routine loans to the city after a June election in which he pulled off a shock victory over President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party (AKP), forcing it to borrow from abroad.
Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), told reporters on Sunday that Turkey's largest city needs more than 20 billion lira ($3.50 billion) in financing, more than half of it for stalled metro projects.
Imamoglu, back in Istanbul after a fundraising tour of European capitals, said all municipal transactions and salary payments were made through state banks.
The city would increasingly lean on foreign lenders and private Turkish banks, he said.
""State banks are not even extending routine loans after the elections to Istanbul municipality. The doors of state banks are closed to us,"" Imamoglu said of the city of around 16 million.
""I condemn the managers of these banks who show this kind of attitude towards the municipality. I have been patient for the past five months,"" he added.
The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the lending by state banks, which account for about 40% of overall Turkish loans and deposits.
In a June re-run poll, Imamoglu's decisive victory ended 25 years of rule in Istanbul by the Islamist-rooted AKP and its predecessors, handing Erdogan one of the most painful setbacks of his political career that began as mayor of the city.
Imamoglu, seen by some as an eventual presidential contender for the secularist CHP, has visited Paris, Berlin and London this month in part to seek financing for underground rail projects stalled for two years.
He secured a 86-million-euro loan deal from the French Development Agency, and a 110-million-euro loan from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) that he announced on Sunday.
FINANCIAL BURDEN
The CHP also defeated the incumbent AKP earlier this year in the capital Ankara.
Its new mayor, Mansur Yavas, said last week the central government had ""disregarded"" a previous deal over metro costs and also cut the city's shares by 5%, leaving Ankara ""under a serious financial burden"".
The government has leaned on state banks to kick-start lending since last year's financial crisis and recession.
According to research published in January, the banks have ""systematically"" adjusted lending patterns around elections in the last 15 years to boost provinces where incumbent mayors from the ruling party faced tough challenges.
State banks also cut lending in provinces where opposition mayors faced tight elections, said the paper, published by researchers at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and London School of Economics.
Imamoglu said Istanbul had 28 billion lira in debt and needed permits from Turkey's Treasury to issue municipal bonds.
""It would not be right for them not to give permissions,"" he said."

Rebels believed to belong to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) have killed more than 70 civilians in massacres since the Congolese army launched an offensive against them this month.
The police force tweeted a photo of the Beni mayor's office with flames shooting from the window and thick black smoke billowing above.
""Security forces are working to re-establish public order,"" it said.
Violence by the ADF and a patchwork of militias and criminal bands near Congo's borders with Uganda and Rwanda have regularly killed civilians and hampered efforts to eradicate a more than year-long Ebola outbreak.
The ADF has been operating near the Ugandan border for more than two decades. It is one of dozens of rebel groups active in the mineral-rich areas where civil wars resulted in millions of deaths around the turn of the century.
Last week, suspected ADF militants killed at least 19 people, kidnapped others and torched a Catholic church.
Several ADF attacks have been claimed by Islamic State, but the extent of their relationship remains unclear.
The World Health Organization said last week that while the number of new Ebola cases in the ongoing outbreak, the second deadliest of all time, was down considerably, it was unable to stamp out the epidemic due to insecurity."

Other exhibits in Dresden include a table-sized sculpture of an Indian royal court from the 18th century, made out of gold, silver, enamel, precious stones and pearls.
Another is a 1701 golden coffee service by court jeweler Johann Melchior Dinglinger, decorated with lounging cherubs.
The treasures of the Green Vault survived Allied bombing raids in World War Two, only to be carted off as war booty by the Soviet Union. They were returned to Dresden, the historic capital of the state of Saxony, in 1958.
The theft was a blow to the whole state, its premier, Michael Kretschmer, said.
""The works in the Green Vault and the Palace were built up by the people of Saxony with many centuries of hard work,"" he said."
1613,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 06:27AM ET</span>","After four decades, a Vietnamese woman reunites with the daughter airlifted to America","By Cath Turner
HO CHI MINH CITY (Reuters) - They wondered about each other over the decades, the Vietnamese mother constantly and more acutely than the 3-year-old daughter she gave up in April 1975, just before Saigon fell to Communist North Vietnam.
As U.S. troops exited Vietnam after twenty years of conflict, thousands of South Vietnamese who had fought alongside them or otherwise opposed the North were terrified of what lay ahead. As some fled, more than 3,000 children were flown to new families overseas in what became known as 'Operation Babylift'.
Among those infants was Leigh Mai Boughton Small - the daughter of a Vietnamese maid and a G.I. - who was airlifted out of the humid chaos of Vietnam for a new life and adopted middle-class family in New England.
Leigh Mai and her birth mother may have spent the rest of their lives wondering about each other - except for the mother's persistence, the daughter's decision to try a DNA website, and help from a Vietnamese Good Samaritan.
After years of trying to find each other, Leigh Mai, now 47, met her birth mother Nguyen thi Dep on Nov. 17 in Ho Chi Minh City, a reunion exclusively filmed by Reuters TV.
It began with awkward hugs. Dep, 70, was afraid her daughter would be disappointed in her - the beautiful young mother had turned into ""an old and gray woman, ugly and skinny,"" she said afterward. Leigh Mai, accompanied by her husband Jeff and three children, was eager to reassure her mother she harbored no resentment about being sent away.
Leigh Mai gave Dep a locket and a scrapbook of her childhood. Dep gave her grandchildren traditional red envelopes containing cash. They hugged, cried and laughed.
What hit Leigh Mai the most was realizing it wasn't just a mother she had lost, but a Vietnamese family ""and that there was love there... and aunts and uncles and that never kind of crossed my mind.""
She also could not comprehend how hard it must have been for Dep all those years ago when Dep had struggled with the decision to hastily send her daughter overseas to an unknown fate.
SAIGON'S CHAOTIC EVACUATION
A feeling of panic was rife in Saigon as the North Vietnamese Army and their Southern (NYSE:SO) wing, the Viet Cong, approached the city in April 1975. The evacuation of American civilian and military personnel, along with tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, was underway.
Dep had worked as a maid and then telephone operator at a U.S. army barracks in Saigon, where she met Leigh Mai's father, Joe O'Neal, she recalled in an interview before the reunion at her home in Thu Duc, on the outskirts of what is now called Ho Chi Minh City.
She lost touch with O'Neal after he was sent home not long after the Paris Peace Accords were signed in January 1973. The little girl, who the mother had named Phuong Mai, was nearly a year old then. A long letter she wrote to O'Neal was returned. He was married and had a family in South Carolina, she later learned.
Dep's American and Vietnamese friends told her to get her daughter on an Operation Babylift flight, telling her 'what if they come and kill her?'
""I panicked and decided to send Mai away. It took only a week from when I filed her paperwork till when the plane took her away,"" said Dep.
Many of the children who were flown to new homes in Operation Babylift were orphans. Others were sent abroad in hopes they would have a better life - or that they might be reunited soon after the chaos of the war. But Vietnam and the United States, where most of the children were taken, did not normalize ties until 1995, dashing those hopes.
The last time Dep saw her daughter, at the orphanage where she was awaiting her flight, she told Leigh Mai she had ""to go wash my face,"" intending to leave by the back door. ""But then her instinct told her something, and she yelled 'Mom don't leave'. To be honest, at that moment all I wanted was to turn around and take her home,"" Dep said. Instead, she walked from the airport to the city center ""and told my boss that I let her go.""
She thought about what she had done ""until it felt like my brain shattered."" She cried ""every night for months. My father didn't speak to me for two months."" She took ""all sorts of jobs"" after that to make a living. ""Life pushed me around.""
But Dep never gave up hope of finding Leigh Mai. She contacted various intermediaries over the years and even wrote a letter to the late U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy, who chaired a Senate subcommittee hearing on Operation Babylift in 1975. She said she never got a reply.
THE GOOD LIFE
Leigh Mai knew from an early age she was adopted and half-Vietnamese but no one had any idea who her parents were. The children of Operation Babylift arrived with little or no documentation.
She enjoyed the good life Dep had hoped for her in a happy, middle-class home in New England with a sister and brother, also adopted.
""I always had a wonderful home and family life, so I just dealt with normal teenage stuff, not really stuff that was about my nationality,"" she said.
Although she occasionally wondered about her mother growing up, it was only when she was 27 in 2000 that she thought of searching for her. She had just got married and knew she wanted to have children.
Leigh Mai and her adoptive mother, Mary Beth Boughton, went to Vietnam to begin the search. Their only clues were Leigh Mai's Vietnamese name, the town she was born in, and the orphanage she was placed in ahead of Operation Babylift.
But the ledger book listing all those who had stayed at the orphanage in Thu Duc began only in May 1975, after the fall of Saigon and a month after Operation Babylift. ""So we just concluded that everything kind of was destroyed or burned from when the Communists finally arrived,"" Leigh Mai said.
She gave up and the years passed. But then commercially available DNA websites offering to help people discover their heritage and family links began to take off. About four years ago, Leigh Mai submitted a DNA sample to ancestry.com, occasionally getting a connection to ""a fifth cousin.""
Then in September 2019, Leigh received an email from ancestry.com telling her of a connection to a ""sibling/first cousin."" Another email arrived that said: ""I think you're my sister. Your Vietnamese mother is looking for you.""
During an exchange of texts with the woman named Bonnie Ludlow, Leigh Mai learned they shared the same father - who had died in 2011 - but had different mothers. ""And I think it just exploded from there,"" Leigh Mai said.
They were helped by a 30-year-old Vietnamese man called Vu Le, who had read an article about Dep's search for Leigh Mai and made it his mission to help her. He found Joe O'Neal's obituary with Bonnie's name, tracked Bonnie down, and told her about the half-sister she had never met.
VALIDATED DECISION
For Dep, Leigh Mai was always a 3-year-old child. ""Seeing her as this grown-up woman with a family, it isn't as emotional as when I looked at her photos as a small baby,"" she said after the reunion.
But the meeting did give her relief about her daughter's life in America.
""I love her a lot and I am at ease because Mai has grown up, having her own family, can take care of her own self, as opposed to before when it was always 'Is my baby still alive? If she is, what life does she have? I was worried she had it hard.""
Leigh Mai thought about bringing her birth mother back to the United States, but Dep prefers her simple life in Thu Duc. She still bikes to her job as a school janitor.
With technology, Leigh Mai thinks they can stay in touch.
""I want her to still be able to live through us through videos and big moments that kids are going to have in their life and that Jeff and I are going to have in our life.
""So I'm hoping that she can get into the iPhone,"" Leigh said with a laugh."

Leni Robredo, a former human rights lawyer who was elected separately from the president, was named as head of the panel just over two weeks ago. Her allies had warned her that Duterte was setting a political trap by giving her the job.
She quickly angered Duterte by criticizing what she called ""senseless killings"" due to the thousands of mostly urban poor killed in what police said were drugs busts that turned into shootouts.
""When I took this job, I asked you, are you ready for me? My question to you now is what are you afraid of? Are you afraid of what I might discover? Are you afraid of what the public might discover?,"" Robredo told a news conference, livestreamed on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
The vice president said she would share with the public what she had discovered about the way Duterte's signature policy was being run.
""If they think I will stop here, then they don't know me, I am just starting"", Robredo said. ""They cannot remove my determination to stop the killings and hold those responsible to account and win the fight against illegal drugs"".
Duterte's lawyer and spokesman, Salvador Panelo said on Monday Robredo was fired from the panel because of her ""incompetence"" and ""failure to introduce new measures"" to effectively combat the drug menace.
But Robredo's allies said her removal only confirmed what they knew all along, and that she had been set up to fail.
""Would the president allow the vice president to succeed in his centrepiece program of an anti-drugs war while he himself dismally failed,"" opposition congressman Edcel Lagman said in an interview with ANC news channel.
Duterte accused Robredo of embarrassing the country by trying to draw undue international attention to his war on drugs and overreaching by seeking classified information.
Robredo, shortly after her appointment, met with officials from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the U.S. Embassy to discuss the drug problem, which she has said must be tackled from a health and social perspective.
The United Nations Human Rights Council in July approved a resolution to investigate the Philippines, and the International Criminal Court is conducting a preliminary examination of allegations of crimes against humanity.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 05:38AM ET</span>","Britain is a dangerous mess, former PM Blair says","By Guy Faulconbridge and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Former prime minister Tony Blair said on Monday that Britain was in a dangerous mess and that neither his own Labour Party nor Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives deserved to win a Dec. 12 election.
Britain is holding an election three years ahead of schedule because parliament was deadlocked over Brexit, unable to agree on how or even whether to leave the European Union.
""We're a mess,"" Blair said at a Reuters Newsmaker event. ""The buoyancy of the world economy has kept us going up to now, but should that falter, we will be in deep trouble."" 
Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said both major parties were peddling fantasies, adding that if the opinion polls were accurate, Johnson's party looked likely to win a majority.
Blair, the only Labour leader to win three elections, said his party was now controlled by its ""Marxist-Leninist wing"" and that its leader Jeremy Corbyn was promising a revolution.
""The problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end,"" said Blair. ""The problem with revolutions is that they always end badly."" 
""The truth is: the public aren't convinced either main party deserves to win this election outright.""
The Dec. 12 vote presents a stark choice between a socialist-run state under Labour, which is offering a second referendum on leaving the EU, and the free-market Conservatives, who want to ""get Brexit done"" by the end of January. 
RISK OF NO-DEAL BREXIT
Blair, an opponent of Brexit, argued for a second referendum on the decision to leave, saying it would need to be followed by another general election.
Johnson has pledged to take Britain out of the EU by Jan. 31 if he wins a parliamentary majority and then to negotiate a comprehensive deal with the bloc covering trade and future relations during a transition period due to end next December.
Blair cast doubt on that timetable and said there was still a risk that Britain could exit the EU in a year's time without having struck a deal with its biggest trading partner.
""No-deal Brexit is not off the table,"" Blair said. ""This negotiation (on the future relationship) has no chance of being concluded in that transition period.""
Blair said he did not know whether Labour, which has tacked sharply to the left under Corbyn, would ever return to the center ground of British politics, but added: ""We must set about the urgent task of reconstructing the sensible mainstream of British politics.""

""Otherwise, this laboratory experiment in populism running riot will end very badly for our nation.""

They were taken from their homes in the capital Riyadh and the Red Sea port city of Jeddah last week by plainclothes police but the reason was unclear, said one of the sources.
The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Riyadh denies having political prisoners, but senior officials have said monitoring of activists, and potentially detaining them, is needed to maintain social stability.
Those detained are not frontline activists, the sources said. Some are intellectuals who have published articles or appeared on television while others are entrepreneurs.
As Riyadh takes over the presidency of the Group of 20 countries, it is struggling to overcome intense international criticism over its human rights record, including last year's killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the arrest of women's rights activists and the devastating Yemen war.
Even as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman touted economic and social openness in the traditionally closed-off country, the authorities rounded up critics, an effort that gathered pace in Sept. 2017 with the arrests of prominent Islamist clerics, some of whom could now face the death penalty.
An anti-corruption campaign two months later netted top businessmen and senior officials. It was criticized as a power play and shakedown of the crown prince's potential political rivals.
In mid-2018, more than a dozen women's rights activists were arrested just as Riyadh lifted a ban on women driving cars. Local media tarred them as traitors, and a court has charged some of them with crimes including contacts with foreign journalists.
This April, eight people, including two U.S. citizens, who had supported the detained women were also arrested.
Public protests, political parties and labor unions are banned in Saudi Arabia, where the media are controlled and criticism of the royal family can lead to prison."

Ankara's purchase of the S-400s has been a major factor souring relations with the United States, which says the system is not compatible with NATO defenses and poses a threat to Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter jets.
The provincial governor's office announced on Sunday that the Turkish Air Force F-16s and other aircraft will conduct low- and high-altitude flights over Ankara on Monday and Tuesday to test an air defense system project.
Broadcaster CNN Turk and other media said specifically that the flights were to test the S-400 radar system. Ankara began receiving the S-400s last July but they are not yet operational.
Dealers said the reports had a negative impact on the lira, which weakened to 5.7380 against the dollar from a close of 5.7140 on Friday. Tensions in U.S.-Turkish relations played a major role in a near 30% slide in the lira's value last year.
As recently as last Thursday, a senior State Department official told reporters Turkey needed to ""get rid of"" the system. Those comments came after President Tayyip Erdogan met U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House.
Trump said their talks were ""wonderful"" but it was unclear if the two NATO allies made any breakthrough on the S-400 issue and Erdogan subsequently said U.S. pressure to get rid of the S-400s was an infringement of sovereign rights.
Washington has suspended Turkey from the F-35 program, which it was a buyer and producer of, to punish it for the S-400 purchase. It has warned of possible U.S. sanctions over the deal but has not yet imposed them.
Trump has told Erdogan the United States is ready to sell Ankara U.S. Patriot systems if it drops the Russian system."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - After months of sometimes-violent unrest in Hong Kong, an election with record turnout handed a big victory to pro-democracy local district council candidates, posing a new conundrum for Beijing and adding pressure on the city's leader.
In the run-up to the citywide elections on Sunday, extreme clashes had broken out between riot police and anti-government protesters who had barricaded themselves in several universities. 
The standoffs were stoked in part by the death of a protester after a fall, and the shooting of another by a policeman at point-blank range.
Yet on Sunday, amid a rare lull, nearly three million people - about three-quarters of eligible voters - queued on a crisp, cerulean autumn day to exercise their democratic rights, with pro-democracy candidates ultimately winning nearly 400 of the 452 seats.
In the last election, four years ago, they won just 100. 
""Most people think the extra one million voters came out to send a political message to the government, that they still support the protesters and they're dissatisfied with the government,"" said Chinese University political scientist Ma Ngok.
""The government and the pro-Beijing camp have always claimed they have public support,"" Ma added. ""But now … this is a big slap in the face because the public has showed their real position in record numbers.""
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said in a statement she respected the result and that her government ""will listen to the views of the public with an open mind and with serious reflection,"" without offering specifics.
""The HKSAR Government will listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect,"" the statement said, referring to the city's formal name, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
District councillors lack political heft and deal largely with livelihood issues. But taken as a bloc across Hong Kong, with their own offices, funding and networks, some say they provide the democrats with an extra lever with which to influence policies, even as the protests rumble on. 
'VOTE OF NO-CONFIDENCE 
Lo Kin-hei, a pro-democracy district councilor who was re-elected, said the vote was in effect a ""vote of no-confidence"" in the political establishment, including Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, and key Chinese officials such as Zhang Xiaoming, head of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
Lo says that district councillors, with around HK$1 million ($127,797) in funding each year, could provide resources to help the ""protest movement's momentum to be sustained.""
In the pro-Beijing camp, there were soul-searching and bows of apology from leaders of the main DAB political party, with leader Starry Lee offering to resign.
Stanley Ng Chau-pei, a Hong Kong delegate to China's National People's Congress, whose trade union members ran as candidates, told reporters it had been an ""unfair"" election.
Ng called on the government to respond with effective policies to ""address the deep splits in society,"" and for effective measures to end the violence.
Lam's room to maneuver, however, remains ""very limited"", according to a voice recording obtained by Reuters this summer, though she has stressed a need to first end the violence and halt the chaos. 
Some observers said she would now face more pressure to respond to the protesters' demands, which include democratic reforms and an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality.
Police tactics in dealing with the protests have been widely seen as one of the major drivers for the clashes. But the government has so far said existing police oversight mechanisms are sufficient to handle complaints.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 amid the promise of a high degree of autonomy, though the erosion of freedoms by China have stoked broader resentment and fueled the current political crisis. 
The likelihood of Beijing offering any new concessions in the short term remains slim, observers say, given the tough line taken so far. 
Of the protesters' key demands, the government has so far only responded to one: In September, it formally withdrew the extradition bill that sparked the first protests. 
China's top legislature said last week that Hong Kong courts have no power to rule on the constitutionality of legislation under the city's Basic Law, a day after Hong Kong's High Court had ruled a controversial ban on wearing face masks was unconstitutional.
Many council districts long dominated by pro-Beijing forces supported by China's United Front struggled against an unprecedented voter turnout of over 70 percent.
The vote underscores a deep pool of support for the protest movement, despite occasional violence by protesters.
Many voters said they wanted to punish the pro-Beijing camp for backing the extradition bill despite a mass airing of public concerns. 
Although some pro-Beijing heavyweights were toppled by relative newcomers, the DAB's Lee says her party will regroup for key legislative council elections next September.

But some observers say Beijing may see an advantage in replacing Lam before then so she does not become an electoral liability.

Kyrgyzstan, a close ally of Moscow and site of a Russian military airbase, is the most politically volatile nation in Central Asia and protests which turned into violent riots toppled two Kyrgyz presidents in 2005 and 2010.
Published this month, the investigative report by several local and international media outlets alleges that a well-connected group has for years been smuggling Chinese goods into Kyrgyzstan and then channeling its profits out of the country.
Kyrgyz private news website Kloop, United States-sponsored Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and a collective of European news outlets called the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), who jointly produced the report, said their main source had been a Chinese-born businessman who fell out with his former partners in the former Soviet republic.
The businessman was shot dead in Istanbul this month.
On Monday, about 500 people gathered on a square outside the main government building in Bishkek, demanding an investigation into the matter and the resignation of senior officials in charge of combating financial crime.
Some carried posters saying ""Return our money"" and ""Kyrgyzstan is not impoverished, Kyrgyzstan is being robbed"".
The Kyrgyz government has said it was investigating the allegations made in the report."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's ruling party denounced China as an ""enemy of democracy"" on Monday following fresh claims of Chinese interference in the island's politics ahead of presidential and legislative elections on Jan. 11.
The allegations, reported by Australian media, were made by a Chinese asylum seeker in Australia who said he was a Chinese spy. China, which claims Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary, has branded the asylum seeker a fraud.
The Chinese man, Wang Liqiang, also provided details of Chinese efforts to infiltrate universities and media in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, which has been rocked by months of anti-government protests. 
Cho Jung-tai, chairman of Tsai's Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, which favors Taiwan's formal independence, said there needed to be further investigations, noting that a lot of fake news came from China.
""The enemy of democracy is China. At present Taiwan's most ambitious opponent, competitor, is also China,"" Cho told a news conference in Taipei.
Taiwan's presidential office cited Tsai as saying on Monday that the allegations were being probed, and that people should not reach conclusions before a complete investigation was done.
Among several allegations leveled, the would-be defector said he had helped guide positive media attention toward certain Taiwanese politicians, including President Tsai's main opponent, Han Kuo-yu of the China-friendly Kuomintang party.
The Kuomintang's Han said he would drop out of the election if he has taken any money from the Chinese Communist Party. 
Speaking at a separate news conference, Kuomintang's spokeswoman Wang Hong-wei said the issue was one of ""blundering Communist espionage"" that should be investigated immediately, and accused the government of seeking to use the matter to ""manipulate elections"".
DOUBTS
China's state-backed Global Times tabloid said in a Monday opinion piece that Wang Liqiang sounded like an ""opportunistic liar, probably a swindler"".
Three Taipei-based diplomatic and security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters they also doubted whether Wang was who he claimed to be, though his allegations were plausible.
""Our assessment is he is most likely not who is says he is,"" said one of the sources.
Separately, Taiwan is investigating two directors of a Hong Kong-listed company which was named in the Australian reports as being involved in Communist Party infiltration of Hong Kong universities and media, the Justice Ministry's Investigation Bureau said on Monday, without giving details.
Wang said he was part of an intelligence operation working within Hong Kong-listed China Innovation Investment Limited to infiltrate Hong Kong universities and media with pro-Communist Party operatives to counter the territory's democracy movement.
In a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange earlier on Monday, the company said the reports were ""all fictitious and forged"" and that Wang had never worked there.
The company said that it had received notification from Executive Director Xiang Xin and alternate Director Kung Ching that they had been about to leave Taipei Taoyuan Airport when Taiwanese investigators requested their cooperation in an ""investigation on the matter of the news reports"".
""In fact, Mr. Xiang and Mrs. Kung knew nothing about the issues exposed in the news reports,"" the statement said. It said both directors had engaged Taiwan lawyers to provide assistance.
It was not immediately clear who their lawyers were. 

The company declined to provide further details beyond what was in the statement.

The publication on Sunday of the documents by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) follows a New York Times report on Nov. 16 based on a cache of secret papers revealing details of China's clamp-down on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the region.
United Nations experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. 
The ICIJ https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm says it obtained a 2017 list of guidelines ""that effectively serves as a manual for operating the camps"", with instructions on how to prevent escapes, maintain secrecy about the camps' existence, indoctrinate internees and ""when to let detainees see relatives or even use the toilet"".
Other documents it obtained include ""intelligence briefings"" showing how police have been ""guided by a massive data collection and analysis system that uses artificial intelligence to select entire categories of Xinjiang residents for detention"".
Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news conference on Monday that Xinjiang affairs were an internal matter of China's, and that a stable and prosperous Xinjiang was the best response to what he said amounted to slander.
The Guardian newspaper, an ICIJ affiliate, reported the Chinese embassy in London as saying ""the so called leaked documents are pure fabrication and fake news"".
Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the documents.
The leaks come amid a rising international outcry over China's broader human rights record in Xinjiang. The United States has led more than 30 countries in condemning what it called a ""horrific campaign of repression"".
Beijing denies any mistreatment of Uighurs or others in Xinjiang, saying it is providing vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism and to teach new skills.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A female senator in Australia won a A$120,000 ($81,432) payout on Monday after suing a male colleague for defamation for sexually offensive remarks, closing a case that brought the spirit of the #MeToo movement to Australia's parliament.
During a June 2018 debate in parliament over a ban on using pepper spray, libertarian Senator David Leyonhjelm had heckled Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, telling her to ""stop shagging men"", a vulgar colloquial term for sexual intercourse.
Comments made in the chamber are subject to legal protections. But Leyonhjelm repeated the remark, using the same term, in subsequent media appearances.
Hanson-Young then filed a lawsuit, the country's first between sitting politicians, accusing Leyonhjelm of defaming her by suggesting she was a hypocrite for claiming all men were rapists but still having sexual relations with them.
""The whole thing is just really awful and part of me wants to not go through with the court case because it's so exhausting, but I can't let him get away with this,"" Hanson-Young said in a hearing, according to a ruling published on Monday by Federal Court judge Richard White.
""He will continue to bully me unless I stand up to him, so I have to.""
Leyonhjelm admitted to the court his public statements carried the meaning suggested by his colleague but defended the lawsuit on the grounds that he was protected by parliamentary privilege. Leyonhjelm also told the court his colleague already ""had, or deserved, a bad reputation"", the judgment said.
But judge White rejected Leyonhjelm's defense, saying his ""conduct was not reasonable and had in any event been actuated by malice"".
""He published his claim concerning the applicant to a mass audience with the intention of publicly shaming her,"" White wrote in a summary of his findings on Monday.
He ordered Leyonhjelm to pay Hanson-Young A$120,000 as ""aggravated damages"".
Hanson-Young wrote in a post from her Twitter account that she sued Leyonhjelm ""for every woman & girl who's been told or made to stay silent in the face of harassment and disrespect"".
""Today's ruling is a win for them,"" she wrote.
Leyonhjelm quit the federal parliament in March to run for a state seat, unsuccessfully. Calls to his former media adviser and his party, the Liberal Democrats, were unanswered, while Leyonhjelm did not respond to a message seeking comment on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page."

The couple, Allan and Wilma Hyrons, were abducted at gunpoint on Oct. 4 from the resort they ran in a neighboring province and were now being looked after at a military camp.
A photograph issued by the army showed the couple unharmed and eating a meal.
The kidnappers were members of Abu Sayyaf, a group that operates in the Sulu archipelago and has extremist factions loyal to Islamic State, and linked to at least five suicide bombings in the region in the past 16 months.
Abu Sayyaf is much feared for its banditry, piracy and kidnap-for-ransom business, with targets that include Europeans and seamen from Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. Some hostages were held for years and beheaded when ransom was not paid, among them a German and two Canadians.
The Philippines does not disclose when demands for their release are met.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has poured more troops into the region to try to wipe out Abu Sayyaf. The group remains influential among local clans and a formidable opponent, with a small and well-equipped network that operates in the jungles of Basilan and Jolo islands.
On Saturday, the army said it had killed a man it believed to be central to the group's planning of suicide bombings and its coordination with Islamic State."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Pope Francis expressed concern about future energy sources as he comforted victims of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster on Monday, noting a call by Japan's Catholic bishops to abolish nuclear power outright.
Around 18,000 people died or were classified as missing after the so-called Triple Disaster, when a massive earthquake set off a tsunami - in some places 30 meters high - destroying a wide swath of Japan's northeastern coast and triggering a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.
Radiation from the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl forced hundreds of thousands to flee the area and thousands will never return.
""Important decisions will have to be made about the use of natural resources, and future energy sources in particular,"" the pope said in an address to survivors in downtown Tokyo.
""Until social bonds in local communities are re-established, and people can once more enjoy safe and stable lives, the Fukushima accident will not be fully resolved,"" Francis said.
""This involves, as my brother bishops in Japan have emphasized, concern about the continuing use of nuclear power; for this reason, they have called for the abolition of nuclear power plants,"" he said.
In a statement released following the Fukushima disaster, Japan's Catholic Bishops Conference said the cessation of all nuclear power generation in the country was ""imperative"" given the country was disaster prone.
Resource-poor Japan has long pushed nuclear power as a solution despite being one of the world’s most earthquake-prone nations. All nuclear power plants were shut after 2011 but several have since been re-opened.
Francis listened intently as Toshiko Kato, the head of a Catholic kindergarten in Miyako City, told him: ""Along with the rest of the town, my home was swept away by the tsunami.""
Several Japanese Catholic officials at the meeting said Francis had repeatedly expressed a desire to go to see the disaster zone first-hand, but scheduling would not permit the trip so they brought some survivors to Tokyo to meet the pontiff.
Teenager Matsuki Kamoshita, who was eight years old at the time of the accident, said radiation was still being emitted and demanded the truth from adults about the long-term effects of radiation.
""It will take many times longer than my lifetime to restore the contaminated land and forests. So, for us who live there, adults have a responsibility to explain without concealing anything about radioactive contamination, exposure, and possible damage in the future. I don’t want them to die before us, having lied or not admitting the truth,"" he said.
Despite the sombre nature of the meeting, held in a convention center in downtown Tokyo, a chamber orchestra played a tango in honor of the Argentinian-born pope to greet him as he walked in and he later thanked them for it. 
Francis, who is making the first trip by a pontiff to Japan since 1981, used visits over the weekend to the only cities ever hit by atomic bombs - Hiroshima and Nagasaki - to underscore his campaign to abolish nuclear weapons. He reiterated his belief that their possession is indefensibly perverse and immoral and their use a crime against mankind and nature. 
After meeting with the Fukushima survivors, Francis met with Emperor Naruhito. He is also scheduled to talk with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later in the day.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2019 11:19PM ET</span>","South Korea, Japan in fresh spat over intelligence deal","By Hyonhee Shin and Makiko Yamazaki
SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - South Korea and Japan traded fresh barbs on Monday, just days after agreeing to salvage an important intelligence-sharing pact, highlighting the fragile ties between the former wartime foes and allies of the United States.
Officials from each side criticized or contradicted comments made by other and in media about whether Tokyo had apologized over what Seoul said was an inaccurate weekend statement about the agreement.
Under pressure from Washington, South Korea made a last-minute decision on Friday to conditionally maintain the pact, known as GSOMIA, a dramatic about-face amid a months-long feud over history and trade.
GSOMIA, or the General Security of Military Information Agreement, is a key symbol of security cooperation between the two old foes and a trilateral partnership with the United States.
Tokyo, for its part, said Seoul made a strategic choice and it hoped to hold trade talks, though it would not immediately restore South Korea's fast-track exporter status.
Officials at Seoul's presidential Blue House said on Sunday they had lodged a protest and received an apology over the Japanese trade ministry's announcement that it will continue enhanced screening on the exports of three core materials used in semiconductors, which they said was ""completely different"" to what was agreed.
On Monday, the Blue House singled out a report of Japan's Yomiuri newspaper quoting a Japanese foreign ministry official as saying it was ""not true"" that Tokyo has apologized.
""To clarify once again, we have complained and Japan apologized,"" senior press secretary Yoon Do-han said in a statement. ""Japanese and Korean media are creating a truth game, but we know the truth.""
Less than two hours later, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga contradicted Yoon's remarks, saying the export curbs were ""completely unrelated to GSOMIA"".
""It is not productive to comment on every remark by South Korea, but it is not true that the Japanese government apologized,"" Suga told a press briefing.
The feud is rooted in a disagreement over compensation for South Koreans forced to work at Japanese companies during the 1910-45 occupation. After South Korea's Supreme Court ordered compensation last year, some former laborers are seeking to seize local assets of Japanese firms, and Tokyo imposed export controls.
South Korean and Japanese trade authorities are expected to meet as early as this week to discuss the issue.
The two countries' foreign ministers agreed on Saturday to work to arrange a summit next month between South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the sidelines of a trilateral meeting with China.
Moon and Abe have not had formal talks for more than a year, though they had an 11-minute chat at an international conference in Thailand early this month.
A senior Blue House official said on Sunday it was ""extremely disappointing"" to see a report by Japan's Asahi newspaper, which quoted Abe as saying that Tokyo has ""not conceded anything"" and South Korea ""simply caved to very strong U.S. pressure"".
""I cannot help but question whether that was something the leader of the Japanese government would say with conscience,"" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's domestic spy agency is investigating whether China tried to install an agent in federal parliament in what Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called ""deeply disturbing"" allegations.
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) said it had launched an investigation before the alleged plot was reported by Australia's ""60 Minutes"" program and affiliated newspapers on Sunday. 
The reports said a suspected Chinese espionage ring had offered ""a seven figure sum"" to pay for a Melbourne luxury car dealer, Bo ""Nick"" Zhao, to run for a seat in Australia's federal parliament.
""The reporting on Nine's '60 Minutes' contains allegations that ASIO takes seriously,"" ASIO Director-General of Security Mike Burgess said in the statement on Sunday.
""Australians can be reassured that ASIO was previously aware of matters that have been reported today, and has been actively investigating them.""
Officials at China's embassy in Canberra were not immediately available for comment.
""I find the allegations deeply disturbing and troubling,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra, adding the government had beefed up Australia's laws and security agencies to counter foreign interference.
""Australia is not naive to the threats that it faces more broadly,"" he added, without commenting on the specific allegations.
Resource-rich Australia's ties with its most important trading partner China have deteriorated in recent years, amid accusations that Beijing is meddling in domestic affairs. 
The government has set up a counter-foreign interference coordinator and given the intelligence and security agencies additional resources to protect Australians and the nation's institutions, a government spokesman said.
Car dealer Zhao told ASIO about the alleged approach from another Melbourne businessman about a year ago, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said in the joint report with ""60 Minutes"" and The Age newspaper, citing Zhao's associates and Western security sources.
Zhao was found dead in March in a Melbourne motel room and police have been unable to conclude how he died, the newspaper said.
ASIO's Burgess said he would not comment further and the death was subject to a coronial inquiry. 
""Hostile foreign intelligence activity continues to pose a real threat to our nation and its security. ASIO will continue to confront and counter foreign interference and espionage in Australia,"" he said.
The latest allegations came a day after media reported that a Chinese defector, who said he was an intelligence operative, told ASIO how China had funded and conducted political interference in Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong.
The man, Wang Liqiang, is seeking asylum in Australia with his wife and young son. 
Morrison said his asylum claim would be assessed on its merits, based on any ""reasonable fear of persecution in their home country"".
Responding to the media reports, Chinese police said the ""so-called China spy"" was a 26-year-old convicted fraudster from the eastern province of Fujian.
Wang's account sparked an angry reaction in the influential state-owned tabloid Global Times on Monday, which said: ""Chinese people would intuitively know that Wang sounds like an opportunistic liar, probably a swindler.""
The newspaper said someone of Wang's age would have been ""in a training or intern programme"" if they were in the national security department. It added that it was very rare for a person in China's national security establishment to have a child at such a young age.
""If Australia's intelligence agency really believed Wang, it would have taken secret counter-espionage actions instead of letting the media expose it,"" the Global Times said.

ASIO has not commented on any counter-espionage actions it may have taken in response to Wang's claims.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2019 09:31PM ET</span>","Lebanese protesters clash with supporters of Hezbollah, Amal in Beirut","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Clashes broke out between anti-government demonstrators and supporters of the Shi'ite groups Hezbollah and Amal in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, early on Monday, as tensions escalated when demonstrators blocked a main bridge.
Lebanon has faced five weeks of anti-government protests, fueled by anger at corruption among the sectarian politicians who have governed Lebanon for decades. Demonstrators want to see the entire ruling class gone from power.
Hezbollah and Amal were both represented in the coalition government led by Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who quit on Oct. 29 after the protests began. The heavily armed Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, had opposed Hariri's resignation.
Army soldiers and riot police formed a barrier separating the protesters from the supporters of the Shi'ite groups on a main road known as the Ring Bridge as rocks were thrown by both sides, television footage broadcast by Lebanese media showed.
Security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, three local television stations reported. 
Supporters of Hezbollah and Amal waved the groups' flags. Earlier, they had chanted: ""Shia, Shia"" and slogans in support of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. On the other side, demonstrators chanted: ""Revolution, revolution"". 
Lebanese broadcaster al-Jadeed reported that fighting apparently broke out when Hezbollah and Amal supporters blamed other demonstrators for making offensive comments about Nasrallah. Reuters could not independently verify the report.
The ground was strewn with rocks. A motorcycle was set on fire.
The Lebanese civil defense said on its Twitter account that it was administering first aid to five people suffering from ""various injuries.""
It was the worst tension in Beirut since a mob loyal to Hezbollah and Amal attacked and destroyed the main protest camp in central Beirut last month. The protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful.

(Reuters) - U.S. Army cadets were this week instructed not to use China-owned social media app TikTok while representing the military, an Army spokeswoman said on Friday, amid concerns over the app's handling of user data.
The directive comes after Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate, urged the Army to review potential risks in its use of the popular video app for recruiting American teenagers.
On Thursday, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said the Army was undertaking a security assessment of the app, which is owned by tech giant Beijing ByteDance Technology Co.
The U.S. Army Cadet Command, which issued the order, oversees the Reserve Officers Training Corp, ROTC, and Junior ROTC, to train university and high school students for the military. The guidance from cadet command was issued in order to ""err on the side of caution"", an Army spokeswoman said.
While cadets can still use the app for their own personal use, the guidance would prohibit them posting TikToks for recruitment, while in uniform or performing official duties. The directive was first reported by online military-focused publication Task & Purpose.
A Reuters search of the hashtags ""#rotc"" and ""#jrotc"" found multiple TikToks of young men and women in U.S. military uniforms lip-syncing, dancing and performing training exercises.
TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company has previously stressed its independence from Beijing and said no U.S. user data is stored in China, but it has failed to assuage congressional concerns about the security of the personal data of U.S. citizens using the app and whether content on the platform is subject to censorship from Beijing.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has launched a national security review of ByteDance's $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly.
An Army spokeswoman said the Army has not given any other specific guidance on the use of TikTok, but that it does have formal social media guidance that applies to the use of all current and emerging social media platforms.
""We also continuously remind soldiers to remain vigilant about the risks of using any social media platform when sharing their personal information and data,"" she said."
1632,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2019 05:47PM ET</span>",Netanyahu's Likud to hold party leadership vote: challenger,"By Dan Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Ari Rabinovitch
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party will hold a leadership vote, a Likud challenger said on Sunday, as pressure mounted on the veteran leader to step aside after his indictment on corruption charges.
Israeli media reported the Likud primary would be held in six weeks. A party spokesman was not reachable to confirm the timeline.
Gideon Saar, a Likud lawmaker who has challenged Netanyahu, wrote on Twitter that he ""welcomes the prime minister's agreement to hold primaries for party leadership.""
Netanyahu's indictment last Thursday came amid political disarray in Israel, after neither Netanyahu nor his main challenger in the general election, centrist Benny Gantz, secured a majority in parliament in April and September votes.
Netanyahu has denied the charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust and said he would stay in office and defend himself.
The four-term conservative leader projected business as usual on Sunday, touring the country's northern frontier and ramping up rhetoric about Iranian threats.
Israel's Supreme Court dismissed a petition by a watchdog group to force Netanyahu to step aside.
The Movement for Quality Government in Israel had said in its court filing that the first criminal charges against a sitting prime minister constituted ""the crossing of a red line and a grave blow to public trust in ruling institutions"".
The court dismissed the petition to force Netanyahu to resign or temporarily recuse himself from office. It said the watchdog had not yet exhausted other avenues, such as petitioning Netanyahu directly and Israel's attorney general.
For his part, Netanyahu kept his focus on security and toured the Golan Heights with top military brass.
""I am doing everything needed to carry out government work, Cabinet work ... in all necessary ways, to ensure the security of the citizens of Israel and the things that are crucial for Israel,"" he said in a video statement.
He reiterated concerns over Iran's attempt to entrench itself militarily in a number of Middle East countries and said Israel ""will act to prevent Iran's attempt to make Iraq and Yemen bases for rocket and missile launches against Israel.""
POLITICAL CHALLENGE
But Israeli news coverage remained focused on the political challenge. Commentators said other court petitions could follow.
Gantz's mandate to form a government - after an unsuccessful attempt by Netanyahu to do so - expired on Wednesday. The next day, Israel's president declared a three-week period in which lawmakers can nominate one of their own to try to put together a ruling coalition.
Should that fail, a new election - Israel's third in a year - will be triggered.
Netanyahu's hope of securing that parliamentary nomination was challenged by Saar.
""There is only one way in which we can save the country, extricate it from the crisis and ensure the Likud's continued rule - and that is if we go to snap primaries today, within these 21 days,"" Saar told Israel's Channel 12 television.
A less adversarial proposal was launched by a second Likud lawmaker, Nir Barkat, who called for nominating a deputy to Netanyahu who would take his place should he be forced to take a leave of absence.
Saar previously said he would consider running for the top Likud slot.
While voicing appreciation for Netanyahu's record-long term and noting he was innocent until proven otherwise, Saar criticised the premier's attempts to cast his criminal prosecution as a ""coup attempt"" involving police, prosecutors and the media.
""Not only is it wrong to say that, it's also irresponsible to say that. It's completely out of touch,"" Saar said.
The Likud party spokesman earlier in the day dismissed the challenge.

""It is sad to see that while Prime Minister Netanyahu keeps Israel safe on all fronts and works to preserve Likud rule, Gideon Saar, as is his wont, is displaying zero loyalty and maximum subversion,"" the spokesman said.

ON BOARD THE OPEN ARMS, OFF SICILY (Reuters) - Italian authorities have agreed to grant the Open Arms ship access to a port to disembark 62 African migrants it has been carrying since Wednesday, the founder of the Spanish rescue mission said on Sunday. 
Oscar Camps said the vessel is set to dock at the southern Italian port of Taranto on Tuesday afternoon, although the eventual destination may change. 
Italy initially refused entry for the group of 73 African migrants which the Open Arms crew plucked out of a packed rubber dinghy drifting about 50 miles off Libya, suggesting that the vessel should instead put them ashore at Tripoli. 
However, earlier today the coastguard evacuated 11 of the group who required medical attention to the port of Augusta and Italy's Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese signaled the country might be softening its position. 
Conditions aboard the vessels have been deteriorating as a powerful storm hit the Mediterranean, creating waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet). 
A Reuters cameraman on the ship saw migrants huddled under a makeshift shelter on deck as the ship rolled through choppy waters and lightning flashed overhead.
Among the group of mostly Central and West Africans are three women, two toddlers and 24 unaccompanied minors who braved the dangerous crossing in search of a better life in Europe.
The Italian government has taken a hard line against immigration and has previously resisted attempts by rescue ships to land migrants in its territory. 
A prolonged standoff with the Open Arms this summer was only resolved after a court ordered authorities to open a port, allowing 100 migrants to disembark.
On the Italian island of Lampedusa, the bodies of five women were retrieved early on Sunday after their boat capsized in bad sea conditions on Saturday, Italian Coast Guard said.
Three were found at sea and two more on a beach, a Coast Guard statement said. Searches were continuing but bad weather was complicating the effort.
The Coast Guard saved 149 people on Saturday, including 13 women and three children, from the sinking vessel after it was reported in distress less than a mile off Lampedusa.
Survivors said up to 20 people were unaccounted for, a judicial source said. Those missing at sea were from Algeria, Tunisia and Pakistan.
There have been nearly 1,000 confirmed deaths on the three main migration routes across the Mediterranean so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. 

""We need decisive action from the Italian government and form Europe to stop human traffickers,"" Lampedusa Mayor Salvatore Martello said from Barcelona, where he is meeting his counterpart Ada Colau to discuss the migrant crisis.

However, the source told Reuters that while the submarine appeared to be carrying drugs it had not yet been confirmed and a spokeswoman for the Guardia Civil said she could not confirm the submarine's cargo as it was still under water.

Chanting ""for fascism no honor and no glory,"" half a dozen women from feminist group Femen, with the same slogan emblazoned across their chests, burst into the crowd when it reached Madrid's Plaza de Oriente. They were quickly removed by police. 
Hundreds of Franco supporters turned out for the march, which is held around Nov. 20 every year to mark the anniversary of the dictator's death. Some demonstrators carried flags with Francoist icons and held an arm aloft in the fascist salute. 
The leader of Spain's fascist Falange party, Jesus Muñoz, said they were marching against the ""desecration"" of Franco's remains, which were exhumed in October, and against Spain's historical-memory law which recognizes those who suffered during the dictatorship. 
""Now they start desecrating tombs, this is not going to be like 1936 (when the Spanish Civil War started) but much worse,"" he said. 
Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975, and his nationalist legacy still divide Spain and its political parties. 
In October, Spanish authorities transferred the dictator's remains from a lavish state mausoleum outside Madrid where he was buried in 1975 to a private cemetery, provoking strong reactions from across the political spectrum. 
Acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialist party had long campaigned to remove Franco's body from the mausoleum, arguing it would help bolster Spain's democratic credentials.
But some political opponents dismissed the exhumation as a ploy to drum up support before a general election and criticized Sanchez for reopening old wounds. 

During Franco's regime, tens of thousands of his enemies were killed and imprisoned in a campaign to wipe out dissent, and as many as 500,000 combatants and civilians died in the preceding civil war, which split the nation in two.

""Today at 1:30 pm nine plainclothes security forces entered the Mada Masr office by force,"" the outlet said on Twitter. ""They immediately began confiscating everybody's laptops and phones. When asked who they were, they aggressively refused to answer.""
After three hours, three staff members including editor-in-chief Lina Attalah were taken away, Mada Masr said. The three were later released from a local police station, it said.
The raid came after security officers had arrested another Mada Masr journalist, editor Shady Zalat, at his apartment in the early hours of Saturday in a separate incident, confiscating his and his wife's laptops and some documents, as well as Zalat's phone, the news website said. It cited Zalat's lawyer as saying late on Sunday that his client had been released.
Officials at the interior ministry could not be reached. An official at the State Information Service, which liaises with foreign media, referred Reuters to the Supreme Council of Media Regulation. The council's head and deputy head did not respond.
On Wednesday, Mada Masr published an article in which it reported that Mahmoud al-Sisi, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's eldest son and a senior intelligence official, was being reassigned to a long-term diplomatic posting in Russia. Authorities have not commented on the article, which Reuters has not independently confirmed.
Reuters could not determine if the article prompted the raid on Mada Masr.
Mada Masr is one of Egypt's last independent news outlets publishing critical stories after years of tightening controls on media and arrests of journalists and bloggers. Its website, which carries stories in Arabic and English, is blocked in Egypt.
Rights activists say Sisi has overseen an unprecedented crackdown on freedoms in Egypt since he took power in 2014.
Sisi and his backers say the measures are needed to keep Egypt stable and to counter threats from Islamist militants.
Last month, the U.N. human rights office called on Egypt to free a prominent blogger, a lawyer and a journalist, all of whom it said were mistreated in custody. They are among several thousand people who activists say have been detained following rare protests against Sisi in Cairo and other cities in September.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Interim Bolivian President Jeanine Anez agreed to withdraw the military from protest areas and repeal a law giving them broad discretion in the use of force as part of a preliminary ""pacification"" deal struck early on Sunday with protest leaders.
In exchange for the concessions, more than a dozen leaders of indigenous groups, farmers and unions who took part in the talks agreed to order their followers to end their demonstrations.
The 12-point pact follows the unanimous passage of legislation by Bolivia's Congress on Saturday to annul contested elections and pave the way for a new vote without former President Evo Morales, a major breakthrough in the political crisis. Anez signed the bill into law on Sunday.
At least 30 people have died in clashes between protesters and security forces since the Oct. 20 election, which was dogged by allegations of vote-rigging. Most have died since Morales stepped down on Nov. 10.
Social leaders blame the military for the deaths. Anez's government denies the charge.
""If there's no need for the army to be in the streets, it won't be,"" Anez said in comments broadcast on state TV at the end of the talks at the presidential palace.
""It's due to extreme necessity that the army was deployed,"" she said. ""It wasn't to abuse anyone or to show power.""
As part of the agreement, military officers will remain on guard at strategic state companies to prevent vandalism. The deal also commits the government to protect social leaders and lawmakers from persecution, provide compensation for family members of people killed in clashes and free those arrested in protests.
Anti-government protesters lifted road blockades - including one at a natural gas plant where nine people were killed in clashes this week - ahead of the weekend's talks.
Talks resume on Sunday at 5 p.m. to finalize a bill that Anez said she would send to Congress for passage later in the day. Sunday's talks will include for the first time Andronico Rodriguez, an influential leader of coca growers who called for protests after Anez took the presidency citing the constitutional line of succession.
""From that moment on there will be pacification, social peace, across the national territory,"" said Juan Carlos Huarachi, the head of Bolivia's largest federation of labor unions, who acted as a mediator in talks. ""We've advanced 99%.""
Huarachi's federation of unions once backed Morales but along with the military was key in pushing him to step down after an audit of the election found serious irregularities."

Relations between the neighbors, traditionally the axis of the 28-member bloc, have become particularly tricky since French President Emmanuel Macron came to power as his ambitious plans for reform have often hit the buffers with cautious Merkel.
Many commentators say the fraught relationship between Berlin and Paris is holding back the EU at a time when it needs to show a united front toward other world powers, such as the United States and China.
Macron irked some allies, including Germany, this month by saying the NATO defense alliance was experiencing brain death and casting doubt on its collective guarantee, whereby an attack on one member is an attack on all in NATO.
Merkel slapped down Macron saying he had used ""drastic words"" and had overreacted. She saw NATO differently, she said.
Norbert Roettgen, a member of Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told Germany's Bild daily that he understood the chancellor.
""But all this doesn't help, we have to get relations with France back on a constructive track,"" he told Monday's edition of Bild, according to an extract released on Sunday.
""To do that we don't always have to wait for Macron's proposals, but we must make some, or at least one, of our own,"" he said, suggesting ideas such as a common 5G network for the two countries or a bi-national sovereign bond for innovation.
""We could transform ourselves from the repairman into a driver of German-French ideas,"" he said.
Bild daily also cited a report in the New York Times which said Merkel had shown exasperation with Macron at a dinner to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
""I understand your desire for disruptive politics. But I'm tired of picking up the pieces. Over and over, I have to glue together the cups you have broken so we can then sit down and have a cup of tea together,"" she was reported as saying to him."

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday fired Leni Robredo, who is vice president, from the role of ""drugs tsar"", his spokesman said, accusing her of undermining the campaign. 
Leni Robredo, a political rival who was elected separately from Duterte, accepted the role just over two weeks ago, against the advice of her allies, who said Duterte's offer was a trap designed to discredit her.
Robredo had angered Duterte by criticizing his police-centered approach to fighting drugs, and the thousands of people killed in his crackdown. Human rights groups say many victims were users and small-time peddlers systematically executed by police.
Police and the Duterte administration reject those accusations.
Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo cited Robredo's meetings with ""out of touch"" Manila-based officials of the United Nations and the United States embassy, as one of the reasons for her sacking.
""The vice president resorted to unduly baiting international attention on the matter, particularly from persons or entities that know little or none at all about our situation, other than their own bias or unsubstantiated prejudgment,"" Panelo said in a statement.
Panelo said Robredo had failed to discuss with the president her plans for tackling the country's drugs problem and Duterte had been patient with her.
""In a campaign where peoples' lives are at risk, a day is an eternity. The government cannot twiddle its thumbs and sit idly hoping for a flash of brilliance from the vice president,"" he said.
Robredo's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The war on drugs, Duterte's centerpiece policy, has caused international alarm over what United Nations experts have called a ""staggering"" number of illegal killings by police, who say they shot thousands of drug suspects only in self defense.
Robredo struck a nerve with Duterte when said he had failed to reduce drugs usage or tackle abusive police, remarks made during an Oct. 23 interview with Reuters, and in subsequent media appearances.
Human rights groups say police are operating with impunity, with the implied support of a president who once vowed to kill 100,000 dealers, and said he would be happy to kill millions of addicts.
The United Nations Human Rights Council in July approved a resolution to investigate the Philippines, and the International Criminal Court is conducting a preliminary examination of allegations of crimes against humanity.
Duterte called a special news conference last week to attack Robredo, calling her a ""scatterbrain"" and accusing her of grandstanding and seeking to share sensitive information with outsiders. He said he would not sack her.
Senator Risa Hontiveros said Duterte was insecure and worried that Robredo would upstage him.

""Not only they were not ready for her, they were scared,"" she told CNN Philippines.

""We caught all the mercenaries who openly confessed they were doing mercenary work for America and, God willing, the judicial system of the country will give them maximum punishments,"" Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi, a deputy Guards commander, was quoted as saying.
Iran has blamed “thugs” linked to exiles and foreign foes - the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia - for stirring up unrest which has led to some of the worst violence in a decade.
Fadavi said several people were killed after being shot at from behind with a handgun from a close distance during the protests, which he said indicated the shooters were among the crowds.
Rights group Amnesty International said in a release earlier this week that security forces shot into crowds of protesters from rooftops and, in one case, from a helicopter.
Amnesty said at least 115 people have died in the unrest. Iran has rejected death toll figures as “speculative”.
Iranian authorities have said about 1,000 demonstrators have been arrested.
The Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group, said on its website that a tally based on official figures and credible reports suggested that “a minimum of 2,755 people have been arrested with the actual minimum number likely being closer to 4,000"".
Protests began on Nov. 15 in several towns after the government announced gasoline price hikes of at least 50%. They spread to 100 cities and towns and quickly turned political with protesters demanding top officials step down."

MONTEVIDEO (Reuters) - Uruguayans headed to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president in a second round run-off vote likely to shift the South American nation back toward the right after around 15 years of liberal rule.
Luis Lacalle Pou, a conservative lawyer whose father is a former president, is favorite to topple the long-standing coalition that has led the farm-driven economy through a period of stability and relative, though recently cooling, growth.
Some 2.7 million Uruguayan voters will choose between Lacalle Pou of the center-right National Party and Daniel Martínez of the ruling Broad Front party. Polls close at 7.30pm local time (2230 GMT).
The first results will come in around an hour later.
As pre-election campaigns closed last week Lacalle Pou, a 46-year-old, had struck a confident tone, saying the South American country was demanding change. Pre-election polls show him beating Martinez by a margin of 6-8 points.
""It's the people... saying 'I want to shake up the government's drowsiness and change it,'"" said Lacalle Pou, who became the front-runner after striking deals with a string of allies following an October first round.
Martinez, a 62-year-old former Montevideo mayor, has said the five-party coalition against him is simply an attempt to dislodge the liberal government that has overseen continuous growth, though seen a recent slowdown.
He has also warned about ""fundamentalist"" policies taking Uruguay sharply to the right, ""ending up like in Argentina or Brazil.""
Amid wider regional unrest in Bolivia and Chile, Uruguay remains stable, but a slowing economy saw growth of just 0.1% in the second quarter of the year.
Unemployment has also edged up to 9.2% versus a year earlier, while inflation this year so far has been 8.36%."
1645,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2019 07:49AM ET</span>",A can-do challenge? Italian 'sardines' take on Salvini,"By Crispian Balmer
REGGIO EMILIO, Italy (Reuters) - Italy has had many colorful political symbols over the years, including oak trees, olive trees and daisies. Now, a new one has suddenly swum into view and is posing a problem for far-right leader Matteo Salvini.
The humble sardine is the emblem of a nascent movement that is challenging Salvini's League party and looking to halt his seemingly inexorable rise to power - initially in the wealthy northern region of Emilia-Romagna where regional elections are set for January, and then further afield.
""We want to show we can defeat the dragon of populism with ideas, with our brains,"" said Mattia Santori, 32, one of four young Italians who dreamt up the so-called 6000-Sardines group.
The movement was born this month at a rally in Emilia-Romagna's capital, Bologna. Santori and his friends hoped to draw 6,000 people, but more than double that showed up, packed like proverbial sardines in the main square.
A few days later, some 7,000 people defied driving rain to hold a similar rally in Modena, while on Saturday up to 8,000 people, many brandishing sardine placards, crowded into the elegant center of Reggio Emilia to stand up to Salvini.
The sardines are not a political party and have no intention of becoming one, but say they want to stir Italians, challenge the League's abrasive, anti-migrant message that dominates social media and try to instill common decency in public debate.
""Finally people have come to their senses and are saying enough is enough,"" said Gaia Landini, 30, who works in education and attended the Reggio Emilia gathering.
""There is so much hatred out there on social media. The League thrives off creating conflict and we have to stand up and shout ‘No’,"" she said.
LEFTIST BASTION
Running along the fertile Po River Valley, Emilia-Romagna has been ruled by a succession of leftist parties, starting with the Communists, since World War Two.
It is holding elections on Jan. 26 and Salvini, whose rightist bloc won all five regional ballots that took place in 2019, has promised to ""liberate"" the left's historic fortress.
Salvini has dragged the League from the edge of extinction to become Italy's largest party in just six years, promoting an uncompromising line on law and order, and promising big tax cuts in defiance of European Union budget rules.
Critics say he promotes hatred with his social media attacks on groups like illegal immigrants, but his message has resonated in a country that has still not recovered from the financial crisis of a decade ago.
Recent Italy-wide opinion polls put him over 30% against around 20% for the next largest party, the center-left Democratic Party (PD) which governs in Emilia-Romagna and also forged a coalition government at a national level in August with the 5-Star Movement.
But Salvini has not yet worked out a strategy for dealing with the sardines and has held back from holding the sort of daily street rallies in Emilia-Romagna that served him so well in previous regional votes, apparently deterred by the prospect of counter-demonstrations.
""Life is very nice looking at Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) all day to work out where I will be and then to come and protest against me. But I have faith we will win in Emilia Romagna,"" he told reporters last week at a book launch in Rome.
NATIONAL POLITICS
A lot more is at stake in January than just local politics.
If the PD sees its bastion fall, it could decide to quit the national government, viewing defeat as a vote of no-confidence in its argumentative, three-month coalition with 5-Star.
""If the League wins here then it could prove the final straw that brings down the coalition,"" said Piero Ignazi, professor of comparative politics at Bologna University.
""The left has been dominant in this region for decades and has a long history of good governance. Defeat would be catastrophic for them and suggest Salvini is unstoppable.""
In elections to the European Parliament in May, the League won 34% of the vote in Emilia-Romagna, while the PD won 31%. Salvini's allies took an additional 10% between them, meaning they should be in the driving seat in the January ballot.
However, the incumbent PD governor is popular in his region, where unemployment is 4.8%, half the national average, and latest polls give him a slight edge against the right.
Nothing can be taken for granted. Salvini seized another leftist stronghold, Umbria, in October and the PD leadership has struggled to respond to a string of recent ballot-box beatings.
Santori, an economist, said he believed most people were opposed to the League's ""Italy First"" mantra and just needed bringing together.
""We are like a shoal of sardines. There are far more of us than the sharks,"" he told Reuters.
Although the movement aims to be inclusive and party banners are not allowed at its rallies, the culture is clearly leftist, with crowds lustily singing the anti-fascist anthem ""Bella Ciao"" as autumn rains beat down on Reggio Emilia.
Its message has spread rapidly beyond the confines of Emilia-Romagna, and the group's newly minted Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page already has a list of 20 upcoming rallies across Italy and as far away as New York over the next three weeks.
""We have to stop Salvini. It doesn't matter if you are red, yellow, white or black. We must end the politics of division,"" said Stefano Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), 46, holding four, handmade sardines pointing north, south, east and west."

France is the main proponent of a plan to build a European-led maritime force to ensure safe shipping in the Strait of Hormuz after tanker attacks earlier this year that Washington blamed on Iran.
Tehran has denied being behind the attacks on tankers and other vessels in major global shipping lanes off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in May and which increased tensions between the United States, Iran and Gulf Arab states.
""This morning we formalized that the command post will be based on Emirati territory,"" Defence Minister Florence Parly told reporters at a French naval base in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. 
The command center will host around a dozen officials representing the countries involved, she said. In a speech to French military personnel, she said the next time she visited the base she hoped the mission would be operational and thanked the UAE for supporting it.
The UAE has tempered its reaction to the attacks and has called for de-escalation and dialogue with Iran.
On Saturday, Parly said the initiative could start early next year and around 10 European and non-European governments would join, pending parliamentary approval.
First announced in July, the plan is independent of a U.S-led maritime initiative which some European countries feared would make U.S.-Iranian tensions worse.
Parly said the two missions would coordinate in order to ensure safety of navigation in an already tense area.
""We hope ... to contribute to a navigation that is as safe as possible in a zone which we know is disputed and where there has already been a certain number of serious incidents,"" she said. She also condemned Iran's latest violations of a 2015 nuclear deal.
On Saturday, Parly said Paris was sending Saudi Arabia defense equipment to confront low-altitude attacks after Riyadh requested help following a September assault on the kingdom's oil facilities which Washington and Riyadh have also blamed on Iran. Tehran has denied involvement.
""We have not had an equivalent request from the UAE,"" she said on Sunday."

Esau has also asked the Windhoek High Court to declare the warrant that authorized his arrest and his detention as invalid, but Judge Hannelie Prinsloo postponed the hearing on the validity of the arrest until Tuesday to give the state time to prepare arguments.
Esau and former client manager of Investec Asset Management in Namibia, Ricardo Gustavo, were arrested following allegations they were involved in a fishing scheme that generated kickbacks of at least 150 million Namibian dollars ($10.20 million).
Esau has denied any wrongdoing. Reuters has not been able to reach Gustavo for comment.
Esau and Justice Minister Sakeus Shanghala quit earlier this month over the bribery claims made in media reports.
The two former ministers are alleged to have awarded horse mackerel quotas to Iceland's biggest fishing firm Samherji in exchange for bribes. Samherji has said it has hired a law firm to investigate the allegations.
The Namibia managing director of Investec, James Hatuikulipi, resigned two days after the ministers, following media allegations that he spearheaded the scheme.
Namibia's Anti-Corruption Commission Director-General, Paulus Noa, said warrants of arrest had been issued for Shanghala and Hatuikulipi.
Shanghala and Hatuikulipi are believed to be out of the country and did not respond to requests for comment.
Investec told Reuters on Thursday that the individuals suspected in the case had left the bank and the company had no connection to it. Its former employees had not used their positions at Investec to facilitate the alleged scheme in any way, it added."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Record numbers of people voted on Sunday in Hong Kong district council elections viewed as a test of support for chief executive Carrie Lam following six months of often violent pro-democracy protests that have convulsed the Chinese-ruled city.
Government data showed more than 2.3 million people had voted by 5.30 p.m., a turnout rate of 56%, with five hours left until polling stations closed - a showing that appeared to have been encouraged by the political turmoil. About 1.47 million voted in the last district elections four years ago.
First results should start trickling in before midnight.
The voter numbers showed people's determination, said one voter named Tsz, 30, who works in the service industry. 
""The high turnout rate...definitely reflects Hong Kong people's hope for genuine universal suffrage,"" he said.
Casting her ballot, the Beijing-backed Lam pledged that her government would listen ""more intensively"" to the views of district councils.
""I hope this kind of stability and calm is not only for today's election, but to show that everyone does not want Hong Kong to fall into a chaotic situation again,"" Lam said.
The protests started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial but rapidly evolved into calls for full democracy, posing the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
They have at times forced the closure of government, businesses and schools as police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon in response to petrol bombs and rocks. Police presence on Sunday was thin, however.
Ming Lee, 26, who works in event production, said she hoped the higher turnout would benefit the pro-democracy camp that is battling some seats that were once uncontested and dominated by pro-Beijing candidates.
""I hope this vote can counter the voice of the pro-establishment, so as to bring in more voices from the democrats,"" she said. ""The social problems encouraged people to vote and to focus on political issues.""
The district councils control some spending and decide issues such as recycling and public health. A record 1,104 candidates were vying for 452 seats and a record 4.1 million people have enrolled to vote.
If the pro-democracy campaigners gain control, they could secure six seats on Hong Kong's semi-representative Legislative Council and 117 seats on the 1,200-member panel that selects its chief executive.
Jimmy Sham, a candidate for the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized some of the anti-government rallies, said: ""We don't know yet, at the end of the day, if the democrats can win a majority. But I hope our Hong Kong citizens can vote for the future of Hong Kong.""
Restaurant manager Jeremy Chan, 55, saw the elections as offering Beijing supporters a chance to share their opinions.
""They believe they are fighting for democracy, fighting for Hong Kong, but the rioters only listen to what they want to hear,"" Chan said, citing vandalism of businesses seen as pro-Beijing. ""Freedom of speech is lost.""
SHARE OPINIONS
Sunday was also the seventh day of a stand-off at Polytechnic University, whose campus has been surrounded by police as some protesters hid out on the grounds. 
""The district council election is almost like a referendum on recent months of social activity,"" said a protester clad in a red university tracksuit, his face covered by a red mask.
""My personal liberty to vote has been violated,"" said the protester, who fears being seized by police if he tries to escape from the campus.
Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. They say they are also responding to perceived police brutality.
China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula for the autonomy of Hong Kong. Police say they have shown restraint in the face of potentially deadly attacks.
Electoral affairs chief Barnabus Fung said there had been 3,638 complaints on Sunday, mostly related to the long queues at polling stations, which he put down to the large numbers voting.
Well-known pro-democracy advocate Alexandra ""Grandma"" Wong, who was detained in the city of Shenzhen over the border from Hong Kong in August, said this was ""the day that we are longing for"".
""Because I was detained in Shenzhen, my ballot has become a wasted paper. This breaks my heart. Please help add oil for me and vote. All the Best!!! Be Safe!!!"" she wrote according to a message on the Lennon Wall protest movement Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.

It was not clear for how long Wong, who became a fixture at protests carrying a large British flag, was detained.

Protesters had gathered overnight on three bridges in the city, and security forces used live ammunition and tear gas canisters to disperse them, killing three, police and hospital sources said. 
More than 50 others were wounded, mainly by live bullets and tear gas canisters, in clashes in the city, they added.
Two more people were killed and over 70 wounded on Sunday after security forces used live fire to disperse protesters near the country's main Gulf port of Umm Qasr near Basra, police and medical sources said.
Hospital sources said the cause of death was live fire, adding that some of the wounded are in critical condition. 
The protesters had gathered to demand security forces open roads around the port town blocked by government forces in an attempt to prevent protesters from reaching the port's entrance.
On Friday, Iraqi security forces dispersed by force protesters who had been blocking the entrance to the port and reopened it, port officials said.
Umm Qasr is Iraq's largest commodities port and it receives imports of grain, vegetable oils and sugar shipments that feed a country largely dependent on imported food.
At least 330 people have been killed since the start of mass unrest in Baghdad and southern Iraq in early October, the largest demonstrations since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Protesters are demanding the overthrow of a political class seen as corrupt and serving foreign powers while many Iraqis languish in poverty without jobs, healthcare or education.
The unrest has shattered the relative calm that followed the defeat of Islamic State in 2017.
Medical authorities evacuated infants and children from‮‮‮ ‬‬‬a hospital in central Nassiriya overnight after tear gas spread inside hospital courtyards, two hospital sources said.
Protests continued in Nassiriya on Sunday, with some government offices set on fire, sources said.
Elsewhere in southern Iraq, hundreds of protesters burned tires and blocked some roads on Sunday in Basra, preventing government employees from reaching offices, police said.

Iraqi security forces also wounded at least 24 people in the Shi’ite holy city of Kerbala overnight after opening fire on demonstrators to prevent them from reaching the local government headquarters, medical and security sources said.

A Reuters witness at the scene of the crash said two people were rescued before the plane exploded. It was unclear how many others on the ground may have been killed or injured. 
Air accidents are relatively frequent in Congo because of lax safety standards and poor maintenance. All Congolese commercial carriers, including Busy Bee, are banned from operating in the European Union.

BISSAU (Reuters) - Voters began casting their ballots in Guinea Bissau's presidential election on Sunday, which they hope will bring change to the coup-prone nation after weeks of political chaos that sparked violent protests and deadlocked parliament.
President Jose Mario Vaz, 61, is seeking re-election for a second term, and he remains popular among cashew nut farmers in the interior after raising prices for the nuts -- the tiny West African country's biggest export earner.
But he faces stiff opposition following a first five-year term marred by political infighting, regular high-level sackings and corruption that came to a head in the run-up to Sunday's election. 
While no reliable opinion polls have been published, political analysts say the front-runner is former Prime Minister Domingos Simoes Pereira, 56, a modernizer with a relaxed style whose promise to bolster health and education have made him popular with younger voters in the capital, Bissau.
Polls opened in Bissau's Bairro Militar neighborhood just after 0700 GMT. Voting runs until 1700 GMT. 
""I am ready to exercise my civic right in order to stabilize the government and to end the long political crisis,"" said Tony Ye, a 35-year-old mechanic as he waited to cast his ballot. 
Preliminary results are expected on Nov. 28. If there is no outright winner, a second round between the top two candidates will take place on Dec. 29.
""Guinea Bissau has faced five years of political and institutional crises,"" Pereira told Reuters, adding that the country needs ""a president who is able to create an atmosphere conducive to the restoration of peace and stability."" 
NINE COUPS
Guinea Bissau has suffered nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974, most recently in 2012 when a military takeover disrupted elections. If Vaz completes his term, he will be the first president to do so.
The country's deserted beaches and scattered islands are a draw for adventurous tourists, but its unpoliced waters also provide passage for drug traffickers smuggling cocaine en route from South America to Europe.
The next president will inherit major challenges including widespread poverty and an unstable political system in which the majority party appoints the government but the president has the power to dismiss it. There have been seven prime ministers since Vaz took over in 2014.
Vaz fired premier Aristides Gomes on Oct. 29 and appointed a successor, but Gomes refused to step down. For about 10 days the country had two prime ministers, until Vaz backed down under pressure from the regional bloc ECOWAS.
Still, Vaz has promised to accept the results of the vote, using his closing campaign speech on Friday to highlight the fact that he had finished his term in office.

""I managed to do what no one did ... in Guinea Bissau since the country became a democracy,"" Vaz told supporters. ""During my mandate there was no coup and I'm very satisfied about this.""

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanians went to the polls on Sunday for a presidential election runoff expected to re-elect centrist president Klaus Iohannis, who has pledged to restart a judicial reform slowed down by successive Social Democrat (PSD) governments.
While there have been no recent opinion polls, local bookmakers make Iohannis the short-odds favorite to beat former PSD prime minister Viorica Dancila comfortably in Sunday's runoff.
Under a succession of PSD governments, Romania rolled back anti-corruption measures and weakened the independence of the courts. Along with ex-communist peers Poland and Hungary, it has been heavily criticized by Brussels for its actions.
However, the 60-year-old Iohannis has been credited by Western allies and the European Union with trying to protect the rule of law, in particular by challenging attempts to limit judges' independence.
""I will vote for a president to represent us, one that is respected both at home and abroad. This is the one we need,"" said retired army staff Ioan Banu, while heading to a Bucharest college to cast his ballot, after polls opened at 0500 GMT.
The president's powers are mostly limited to nominating a prime minister on the basis of who can command a majority, challenging laws in the Constitutional Court, and appointing some chief prosecutors.
If elected again, Iohannis will have a chance to install anti-graft and anti-mafia prosecutors who are serious about tackling endemic corruption with the backing of Prime Minister Ludovic Orban, who became head of a liberal minority government by winning a parliamentary vote of confidence three weeks ago.
Teacher Andreea Mihai, 50, said that if Iohannis won on Sunday, ""things should slowly return to normality.
""Both Orban and Iohannis will work together in the same direction.""
Dancila's PSD had increased the burden of proof in corruption cases, reorganized panels of judges and set up a special unit to investigate magistrates for potential abuses, a move widely seen as an instrument of political coercion.
Romania's judicial reforms have been monitored by Brussels since it joined the EU in 2007; in October, Brussels said the reforms were going backwards.
   Iohannis, a soft-spoken ethnic German and former mayor of Sibiu, became president in 2014.

He helped to secure a popular approval in a referendum last May that called for the government to be banned from altering legislation by emergency decree, and advocated a ban on amnesties and pardons for graft-related crimes.

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2019 01:35AM ET</span>",China meddling allegations roil Taiwan election campaign,"By Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - New allegations Beijing tried to infiltrate Taiwan's democracy roiled election campaigning on the island this weekend, with President Tsai Ing-wen's main opponent saying he would drop out if he had taken money from China's Communist Party.
A Chinese defector, named as Wang ""William"" Liqiang by Australian media, gave a sworn statement to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, or ASIO, about Beijing's efforts to influence politics in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia.
In particular, Wang said he helped guide positive media attention toward certain Taiwanese politicians, including Tsai's top challenger, Han Kuo-yu from the China-friendly Kuomintang party. China, in a late night statement on Saturday, said Wang is a convicted fraudster who traveled on fake documents.
Taiwan, claimed by China as its sacred territory to be brought under Beijing's control by force if needed, is already on high alert for Chinese attempts to sway presidential and legislative elections scheduled for Jan. 11, whether through disinformation campaigns or military intimidation.
The details about what China is suspected of doing in Taiwan quickly provoked strong reaction from both Han and his party and Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for Beijing.
Speaking on a campaign stop in eastern Taiwan on Saturday, Tsai said China's ""shadow"" was becoming more and more obvious.
Taiwan must not let China destroy its democratic values, she added.
DPP Chairman Cho Jung-tai, writing on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, said the Kuomintang was teaming up with the Chinese Communist Party against Taiwan and urged people to use their vote wisely.
""Will one ballot decide whether Taiwan wants to go into totalitarian China with the Kuomintang?"" Cho wrote.
The Kuomintang called the reports in the Australian media ""quite sensational"", adding it hoped the government did not use this to ""play the fear of the communist's card"".
Han told reporters he had doubts about what the defector was claiming, asking how the Kuomintang lost the last presidential election in 2016 if China really was swaying elections.
If he had taken money from China's Communist Party, Han vowed to resign from his post as mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung, to which he was elected a year ago.
""In this year's presidential election, if Han Kuo-yu has taken even one cent, he will immediately drop out of the race,"" Han told reporters, adding he needed more information.
""Can Mr. Wang please come directly to Taiwan, and not hide overseas.""
China's Taiwan Affairs Office, in a statement to Taiwanese media, said Beijing was not intervening in Taiwan's election, and called accusations to the contrary ""nonsense"".
Taiwan's government says it is investigating Wang's claims, and is asking Australia to provide further information.
Late Saturday, DPP legislative whip Ker Chien-ming said they would make a renewed push for anti-infiltration legislation this week in light of the Australian reports.
Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Chinese Communist Party.
While no peace treaty has ever been signed, Kuomintang delegations these days visit China regularly. Han met the head of China's Taiwan Affairs Office in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen in March."
1657,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2019 09:58PM ET</span>",Pope urges abolition of nuclear weapons at Nagasaki ground zero,"By Philip Pullella and Elaine Lies
NAGASAKI, Japan (Reuters) - Pope Francis, speaking in one of only two cities hit by atomic bombs in history, appealed on Sunday for the abolition of nuclear weapons, saying their mere possession was perverse and indefensible.
He restated his support for a 2017 treaty to ban nuclear weapons agreed by nearly two-thirds of U.N. members, but opposed by big nuclear powers who say it could undermine nuclear deterrence, which they credit with averting conventional war.
""The possession of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is not the answer (to longings for peace),"" Francis said, after having closed his eyes in prayer and lighting a candle in memory of the victims. 
""Our world is marked by a perverse dichotomy that tries to defend and ensure stability and peace through a false sense of security sustained by a mentality of fear and mistrust,"" he said in a somber voice, amid driving rain and strong wind.
""Peace and international stability are incompatible with attempts to build upon the fear of mutual destruction or the threat of total annihilation.""
Francis, who was speaking at Nagasaki's Atomic Bomb Hypocenter Park, ground zero of the bomb the United States dropped on Aug. 9, 1945, instantly killing 27,000 people, also decried what he called a dismantling of non-proliferation pacts.
Nagasaki was the second city hit by an atomic bomb during World War Two. Later on Sunday, the pope was due to visit Hiroshima, site of the first blast, which instantly killed about 78,000 people.
About 400,000 more eventually died of radiation illness and injuries caused by the bombs dropped by the United States in an effort to end the war.
""Here, in this city, which witnessed the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental consequences of a nuclear attack, our attempts to speak out against the arms race will never be enough,"" Francis said in his emotional appeal.
Resources spent on the ""arms race"" should be used for development and protection of the environment, instead.
""In a world where millions of children and families live in inhumane conditions, the money squandered and the fortunes made through the manufacture, upgrading, maintenance and sale of ever more destructive weapons, are an affront crying out to heaven,"" he said.
Last August, the United States pulled out of one landmark strategic arms accord, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), citing violations by Russia that Moscow denies.
Nuclear experts said it also appeared doubtful that agreement on a full-fledged replacement for the New START nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the United States will be in place before it expires in February 2021.
COLLECTIVE MEMORY
The bombing is seared in the collective memory of the people of the green and hilly harbor city of Nagasaki and has been passed on through the generations.
""We can't have any more atomic bombings. It'd be great if that message would get across to the world. I'd like it if nuclear weapons were eliminated and there wasn't any more war,"" said Chizuko Hisamatsu, 66, a housewife. ""I think I may cry.""
The pope delivered his appeal standing near a large print of a famous photograph taken by an American soldier shortly after the blast, showing a Japanese boy taking his dead younger brother to be cremated.
After his address, Francis spoke at a monument to faithful martyred during the 250 years in which Christianity was banned in Japan, forcing believers to go underground or face death. 
""Hidden Christians"" blended Christianity with Buddhism and native Shinto beliefs to survive, and Francis may meet several members of the aging, dwindling population later on.

Jesuits brought Christianity to Japan in 1549, but it was banned in 1614. Missionaries were expelled and the faithful were forced to choose between martyrdom or hiding their religion. The ban was lifted in 1873.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri on Saturday warned regional countries of consequences if it is proven that they meddled to stoke recent unrest in Iran. 
""Some countries in the region should know that they will not have an easy life in the region if clues are found that show they intervened to create unrest in Iran,"" said Jahangiri, quoted by the semi-official news agency Fars.
Iran has blamed ""thugs"" linked to exiles and foreign foes - the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia - for stirring up unrest following hikes in gasoline prices which led to the some of the worst violence in a decade.
Iran's regional rival Saudi Arabia and its arch-foe Israel have backed U.S. moves to reimpose sanctions that have crippled Tehran's economy, after Washington withdrew from the Islamic Republic's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.
Meanwhile, police said 180 ""ringleaders"" of the unrest had been detained by its agents across the country, state television reported. On Friday the judiciary said the Revolutionary Guards had arrested about 100 leaders of protests.
About 1,000 demonstrators have been arrested, Iranian media said nearly a week ago.
The Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group, said on its website that a tally based on official figures and credible reports suggested that ""a minimum of 2,755 people have been arrested with the actual minimum number likely being closer to 4,000"".
Iranian troops and members of the elite Revolutionary Guards helped police quell violent unrest in Kermanshah province this week, Iranian officials said on Saturday, accusing ""U.S. agents"" of being among the armed protesters.
The unrest appears to be the worst violence at least since Iran stamped out a ""Green Revolution"" in 2009, when dozens of protesters were killed over several months.
Rights group Amnesty International said at least 30 people were killed in Kermanshah, making it the worst-hit by the protests and it updated its death toll to 115 from 106.
Iran rejected the death toll figures as ""speculative"".
Bahman Reyhani, the Revolutionary Guards' commander in Kermanshah, said ""the rioters belonged to anti-revolutionary (exiled opposition) groups and America's intelligence services,"" the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
He did not name the groups. Armed Iranian Kurdish militants have long operated near the province's border with Iraq.
Guards spokesman Brigadier General Ramezan Sharif said the protests had been initiated by royalists seeking the return of the Pahlavi dynasty toppled by the 1979 revolution, and the exiled Mujahideen Khalq armed opposition group, Tasnim reported. 
He said ""secessionist"" groups were also involved, apparently referring to ethnic Arab and the Kurdish militants. 
Protests began in several areas on Nov. 15 after the government announced gasoline price hikes of at least 50% and imposed rationing. The unrest spread to at least 100 towns and cities as demonstrators demanded senior officials step down.
Iran condemned a U.S. decision to impose sanctions on the Iranian information minister on Friday for his role in a nationwide internet shutdown meant to help stifle the protests.
""Everyone knows that the current U.S. administration does not value the principles of democracy, transparency and human rights, including freedom of the internet, for others,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said, according to state media.
On Thursday, Iran's National Security Council that had ordered the shutdown approved reactivating fixed-line internet in some areas after a five-day outage.

The restoration of the internet, slow on the first two days, sped up on Saturday, with observatory NetBlocks indicating that network data showed connectivity was up to 72% of normal levels.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, who has been in the job for four days, said on Saturday he had pressed his Chinese counterpart about the case of two Canadian citizens jailed in Beijing.
China says the two men are being held on state secrets charges. They were detained last December, shortly after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant.
Champagne, named to his post in a cabinet shuffle on Wednesday, said he had raised the matter when he met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for almost an hour on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Nagoya, Japan.
""In particular I expressed my concern and the concern of all Canadians regarding the conditions of their detention. Mr Wang and I committed to ... continue discussing this issue,"" Champagne told reporters on a conference call from Tokyo.
Canadian diplomats make regular consular visits to the two men, neither of whom has yet been allowed to see a lawyer.
Champagne declined to give details of what he called a good, frank and substantive conversation with Wang, saying that would not be in the detainees' interests.
""There was receptivity of the concern of Canada,"" said Champagne, who spoke in English.
The meeting was the first between the two countries' top diplomats since Wang met Chrystia Freeland, Champagne's predecessor, in August this year.
China's new ambassador to Ottawa on Friday repeated a demand that Canada immediately release Meng, who is the daughter of the Huawei founder. China has also blocked imports of canola seed from Canada."
1660,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2019 07:43PM ET</span>","Colombian protests roll on for third day amid tear gas, injury","BOGOTA (Reuters) - Groups of demonstrators were dispersed by tear gas on Saturday during a third day of protests in Colombia and videos on social media showed at least one gravely injured protester.
The demonstrations followed an overnight curfew and isolated looting in the capital Bogota.
More than 250,000 people marched in a national strike on Thursday to express growing discontent with President Ivan Duque's government, while thousands gathered on Friday for dozens of ""cacerolazo"" demonstrations - a traditional Latin American protest in which people bang pots and pans.
Three people were killed following Thursday's protests in connection with alleged looting, which is under investigation by authorities.
Demonstrators' grievances range from anger at economic plans the government denies supporting to what protesters say is a lack of action to stop corruption and the murder of human rights activists, among other issues.
""I'm against the repression, abuse, aggression and mistreatment that the government is committing,"" said pensioner Claudia Rojas, 55, as she gathered at a cacerolazo in Bogota's Hippie Park among a mostly young crowd while a helicopter circled overhead. ""More than anything I'm against the labor, pension and health reforms the government wants.""
The hundreds of demonstrators later sang the national anthem.
Earlier on Saturday hundreds of protesters were dispersed with tear gas from a main roadway near Bogota's National Park.
Videos posted on social media showed medics performing CPR on one protester, as they kneeled near what appeared to be blood.
Demonstrators also gathered outside of congress in Bolivar Plaza, near the presidential palace. Though vocal, the crowds appeared smaller than previous protests, according to a Reuters witness.
All of Bogota was under curfew from 9 p.m. on Friday through 5 a.m. on Saturday.
Duque said on Saturday the police and army would make continual patrols to prevent further vandalism, after two nights of disturbances left dozens of mass transit stations damaged, several stores looted and many residents panicked about safety.
Bogota Mayor Enrique Penalosa said that looting and what officials said were false reports of residential break-ins overnight may have been coordinated by criminals.
""We need to be prepared for a long effort, I invite you to have patience, to have resilience because hard and difficult days are coming,"" Penalosa said in a joint news conference with Duque and security officials.
""This isn't about some young people who are having spontaneous demonstrations, there is a plot here, high-level organization, some politickers interested in destabilizing the country,"" he added.
Duque's administration has been plagued by problems during his 15 months in office, including a combative congress, low approval ratings and unsuccessful legislative efforts.
The protests have coincided with demonstrations elsewhere in Latin America, from anti-austerity marches in Chile, to protests over vote-tampering allegations in Bolivia that led President Evo Morales to resign, and inflamed tensions in Ecuador and crisis-hit Nicaragua.

Three police officers were killed in a bomb blast late on Friday at a police station in the southwestern province of Cauca, known as a hot spot for drug trafficking and violence.

(Reuters) - U.S. Army cadets were this week instructed not to use China-owned social media app TikTok while representing the military, an Army spokeswoman said on Friday, amid concerns over the app's handling of user data.
The directive comes after Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate, urged the Army to review potential risks in its use of the popular video app for recruiting American teenagers.
On Thursday, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said the Army was undertaking a security assessment of the app, which is owned by tech giant Beijing ByteDance Technology Co.
The U.S. Army Cadet Command, which issued the order, oversees the Reserve Officers Training Corp, ROTC, and Junior ROTC, to train university and high school students for the military. The guidance from cadet command was issued in order to ""err on the side of caution"", an Army spokeswoman said.
While cadets can still use the app for their own personal use, the guidance would prohibit them posting TikToks for recruitment, while in uniform or performing official duties. The directive was first reported by online military-focused publication Task & Purpose.
A Reuters search of the hashtags ""#rotc"" and ""#jrotc"" found multiple TikToks of young men and women in U.S. military uniforms lip-syncing, dancing and performing training exercises.
TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company has previously stressed its independence from Beijing and said no U.S. user data is stored in China, but it has failed to assuage congressional concerns about the security of the personal data of U.S. citizens using the app and whether content on the platform is subject to censorship from Beijing.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has launched a national security review of ByteDance's $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly.
An Army spokeswoman said the Army has not given any other specific guidance on the use of TikTok, but that it does have formal social media guidance that applies to the use of all current and emerging social media platforms.
""We also continuously remind soldiers to remain vigilant about the risks of using any social media platform when sharing their personal information and data,"" she said."

HAWASSA, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Ethiopia's Sidama people have voted overwhelmingly to form their own self-governing region as many of the country's ethnic groups demand greater autonomy under sweeping reforms led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
The country's electoral board said on Saturday that provisional results showed 98.5% of voters had backed the change in Wednesday's ballot, with turnout reaching 99.7%.
The result grants the Sidama, who represent about 4% of Ethiopia's 105 million population, their own self-governing region - the country's 10th, control over local taxes, education, security and certain legislation.
Ethiopia's constitution gives the right to seek autonomy to its more than 80 ethnic groups, but it is only under Abiy's political reform agenda that the government approved the Sidama request for a referendum.
The country, once one of Africa's most repressive nations, has been undergoing rapid changes since Abiy was appointed last year, promising to forge a more open society. 
But the greater freedoms have also allowed long-repressed ethnic tensions to boil over and emboldened powerful regional strongmen demanding more rights for their people.
Last year, ethnic violence forced more than two million people from their homes and killed hundreds, according to the United Nations and monitoring groups.
Saturday's result may encourage the more than a dozen other ethnic groups that are considering requesting similar votes, a move that could threaten Abiy's push to unify the country ahead of elections scheduled for 2020.
The Sidama's new homeland will be carved out of the Southern (NYSE:SO) Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNP) region, the most ethnically diverse part of Ethiopia, bordering Kenya and South Sudan. Hawassa, 275 km (170 miles) south of Addis Ababa, will be the new regional capital. 
A senior police official in Hawassa told Reuters celebrations had been banned on Saturday but that festivities would be organized once the final result had been announced.
People refrained from celebrating publicly but many drivers sung and played music in their cars. Shortly after the results were announced, a group of young people gathered in Hawassa's central square to sing and dance. They were quickly dispersed by police with whistles, and heavy rain by nightfall kept many people indoors.
""I have friends who died, were imprisoned and exiled for this cause,"" Unani Fikro, 24, a member of a Sidama activist group, said after the results were announced. ""For me it's the day of resurrection,"" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.
Members of other ethnic groups living in the city said they feared the vote's outcome meant they could suffer discrimination or become marginalized.
""I'm afraid that the Sidama will come and hurt us ... they will take all the jobs and even if you file a complaint it will go unheard as you will be complaining to one of them,"" said Tsion, 28, a Hawassa resident who did not want to give her full name for fear of retribution.

Ethiopia's Human Rights Commissioner Daniel Bekele, who visited more than 100 polling stations in five cities and 15 rural towns across the Sidama zone during Wednesday's vote said in a statement that the referendum was peaceful and no major irregularities were reported.

In Paris, the mostly female activists chanted ""Abuser, you've had it, women are in the street"" and held purple placards bearing the names of female victims and slogans such as ""not another murder more"". Purple is a symbolic color used by the women's rights movement.
President Emmanuel Macron expressed his solidarity after the end of the protest.
""I give my support to every woman who has experienced gender-based or sexual violence. Count on me to continue the mobilization of the government and the entire nation in this great cause,"" he said on Twitter.
Some 35,000 people participated in the march in Paris, police said.
The #NousToutes association, which organized the protests, estimated the turnout much higher at 100,000 in Paris and 150,000 across France.
The demonstrations took place two days before the government is due to publish the results of an investigation into domestic violence. 
The government is also set to announce a series of new measures aimed at protecting women, the Justice and Interior Ministers and the Secretary of State for Gender Equality said in a joint opinion piece in Le Parisien daily on Saturday. 
""We can and we should do better,"" they wrote.
A Council of Europe expert group on domestic violence (GREVIO) said this week France needed to offer better protection for victims and their children and more effective anti-violence measures. 
""We cannot continue to accept that women are being murdered today with total impunity. The state must do its job to guarantee the security of all women in this country,"" #NousToutes activist Karine Plassard told Reuters in Paris.
Other marches took place in French cities such as Lyon, Strasbourg, Bordeaux and Lille.

""There is far too much violence against women everywhere in society, at work, in our intimate lives,"" said Paris demonstrator Pauline, 28. ""The masculine part of the population must be aware of what they are doing to the other half.""

EL ALTO/LA PAZ (Reuters) - Anti-government demonstrators in Bolivia lifted road blockades ahead of talks with interim President Jeanine Anez on Saturday aimed at ending weeks of unrest, as Congress moved toward passing a bill to pave the way for new elections.
The developments have brought Bolivia the closest it has come yet to a breakthrough during violent protests that have convulsed the landlocked South American country since its contested Oct. 20 election.
More than 30 people have died in clashes, most following the resignation of President Evo Morales, who agreed to step down under pressure from security forces and protesters amid allegations he rigged the vote to give him an outright win.
Morales, an iconic socialist leader in Latin America who had been in power for nearly 14 years, has said he was toppled in a coup and has relocated to Mexico, which has granted him asylum.
But lawmakers in his Movement to Socialism (MAS) party have reached a deal with other parties to pass legislation needed to appoint a new electoral board to call new elections. The bill they hashed out would annul the Oct. 20 election and was passed by the Senate unanimously on Saturday. The lower chamber was expected to pass it later in the day. 
In the highland city of El Alto near the seat of government in La Paz, road access to a natural gas plant that has been a focal point of protesters resumed early on Saturday, with vans packed with commuters dodging boulders, burned tires and other debris still scattered on streets.
Local media reported that road blockades in other regions had also been lifted as part of a pause in demonstrations.
El Alto residents waited in a long line in drizzling rain to refill their natural gas tanks outside the plant, Senkata, where eight people were killed in clashes between security forces and protesters on Tuesday. 
""We've been cooking with wood in the patio,"" said El Alto resident Miriam Gonzalez, 44, as she lined up with family members, adding they had been in line for three hours. 
But some El Alto residents said the blockade at Senkata might resume depending on how talks with the government go, and local media reported that fresh clashes between protesters and security forces erupted on Saturday in the region of Cochabamba, a stronghold of support for Morales.
Anez is scheduled to meet late Saturday afternoon with protest leaders from El Alto and other parts of Bolivia where road blockades have choked off food and fuel to cities.
""They've guaranteed to us that all social sectors will be present so we can once and for all reach deals to pacify the country,"" Public Works Minister Yerko Nunez told journalists late on Friday. 
It was unclear what protest leaders would demand from Anez.
In recent days, protesters have marched to demand justice for people killed in clashes and the repeal of a law Anez' government passed that gave the military broad discretion in the use of force to restore order. Some have also pushed for Morales to return to Bolivia to carry out the rest of his term.
Morales' children left the country early on Saturday with instructions from Anez that they be provided safe passage, interim interior minister Arturo Murillo wrote on Twitter, posting a picture of boarding passes that showed them heading to Buenos Aires.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A senior Australian politician on Saturday said he was disturbed by the reported efforts of China to infiltrate politics in Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan detailed by an asylum seeker who said he was a Chinese spy.
Resource-rich Australia's ties with its most important trading partner China have deteriorated in recent years, amid accusations that Beijing is meddling in domestic affairs.
""These are very disturbing reports,"" said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, adding that government law agencies were dealing with the matter. 
The defector, named as Wang ""William"" Liqiang by the Age newspaper, gave a sworn statement to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), identifying China's senior military intelligence officers in Hong Kong, the newspaper said.
He has also purportedly revealed details of how China funds and conducts political interference in Taiwan and Australia, the Age reported.
Police in China's financial hub of Shanghai, responding to the Australian report, said Wang was a 26-year-old unemployed man from the eastern province of Fujian and was wanted in connection with a fraud case.
On April 10, he went to Hong Kong carrying a fraudulent Chinese passport and Hong Kong permanent residency card, they added in a brief statement.
Wang had previously been convicted of fraud in 2016 in Fujian, Shanghai police said.
Reuters reported before Australia's election in May that Australian intelligence had determined China was responsible for a cyber-attack on its national parliament and three largest political parties. China denies the accusations.
Wang said he was a part of an intelligence operation within a Hong Kong-listed company that infiltrated universities and media, the Age said. 
""I have personally been involved and participated in a series of espionage activities,"" it cited Wang as saying in his October statement to the intelligence agency.
The ASIO declined to comment, saying only that it did not comment on operational matters or individuals.
Wang also said there were plans by China to disrupt the presidential vote on the self-ruled island of Taiwan next year, the Age added.
Taiwan's presidential office said the government was investigating. A spokeswoman for the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party called the information in Australian media a reminder of the threat from China. 
""Whether it is the Chinese internet army or the Chinese government, it is using the democratic system of Taiwan to infringe upon our democracy,"" Lee Yen-jong said.
China considers Taiwan a wayward province and has never ruled out the use of force to bring it under Beijing's control.
Han Kuo-yu, the presidential candidate of Taiwan's main opposition, the China-friendly Kuomintang party, urged the government to immediately send a team to Australia to investigate. 

Wang also gave Australia details of the kidnapping of a Hong Kong bookseller taken to the mainland and interrogated on suspicion of selling dissident materials, the paper said.

""Of course South America is a concern for all of us,"" he said at an event in Rio de Janeiro, highlighting in particular the case of Venezuela. ""We have to be prepared and not be surprised by the facts, but so far I see no reason for this movement to come here.""
He also described the recent protests in Chile, whose 1973-1990 dictatorship Bolsonaro has praised in the past, as excessive.
""These are not demonstrations, they are acts of terrorism,"" Bolsonaro said.
Bolsonaro added that the government is considering legalizing the export of so-called ""in natura"" wood - native trunks from the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other forests that could be sold abroad without any prior processing.
The president said the case is under consideration by Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, and permission to export such wood may need congressional approval.
""It is better to export in a legalized manner than in a clandestine manner,"" Bolsonaro said. ""Ricardo Salles will give me the final say next week.""
Bolsonaro has faced criticism from some countries and environmental groups over his stewardship of the Amazon, one of the world's key bulwarks against climate change. Bolsonaro argues that it is Brazil's choice how to develop its land.
On Saturday, he said he was unconcerned by critics' accusations against him.
""I am not worried about losing allies. I am worried about not losing Brazil,"" he said."

VALLETTA (Reuters) - Prominent businessman Yorgen Fenech, arrested by Malta police as a person of interest in the murder of an anti-corruption journalist, has asked for a pardon in return for information about the case, police sources said on Saturday.
He is the second man to seek a pardon after Melvin Theuma, under arrest on suspicion of having been a middleman in the murder, made a similar request earlier in the week.
Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has already agreed to give a pardon to Theuma if he gives full information that could be used in court.
Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb on Oct. 16, 2017 and three men are awaiting trial accused of having set off the bomb, but police have yet to identify who commissioned the murder.
Fenech was intercepted on his yacht as he tried to leave Malta on Nov. 20, shortly after news of Theuma's arrest was made public.
Maltese Economy Minister Christian Cardona was briefly questioned on Saturday in connection with the murder investigation, an official source close to the minister told Reuters. 
The Economy Ministry later said in a statement, ""Chris Cardona was asked to provide some clarifications, including on speculations that were made about him in the past.""
It made no comment on the nature of the speculations.
Cardona had been a frequent target of Caruana Galizia's blog posts, and had sued her after she accused him of visiting a brothel while on official business abroad. He has always denied the accusation. 
Maltese media reported that Theuma had incriminating recordings about the murder in his possession and that these had now been handed to a magistrate. The police have not confirmed the reports.
Lawyers for Theuma and Fenech have not yet made any official comment on the case.
Caruana Galizia's family have asked Muscat to distance himself from the investigation due to a potential conflict of interest in view of Fenech's links to the prime minister's chief of staff Keith Schembri and Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi.
Muscat rejected suggestions on Friday that he should not be the person who decides on pardons in the case.
""It is obvious I do not shelter anyone, I will do whatever is necessary, when it is necessary,"" Muscat said. 
A Reuters investigations last year revealed that Fenech was the owner of a mystery Dubai company called 17 Black which emails named as one of two sources of income for secret Panama companies set up for Schembri and Mizzi.
Mizzi had been energy minister when a power station contract was awarded to a group led by Fenech. It is not known whether any funds actually changed hands. Mizzi and Schembri have always denied wrongdoing and Muscat has repeatedly resisted calls for their dismissal.
""The prime minister has no place anywhere near the investigation and we trust that he will now distance himself from it"" Caruana Galizia's family said in a statement on Friday. 

""Too many people have worked too hard for too long for justice. The prime minister should not derail, in one final attempt, full justice for our wife and mother,"" they added.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>",Bavarian boss's stirring speech reignites Merkel succession debate,"By Paul Carrel and Alexander Ratz
LEIPZIG, Germany (Reuters) - Less than 24 hours after Angela Merkel's protegee won a statement of support from her party, Bavarian conservative leader Markus Soeder gave a barnstorming speech to the Christian Democrats (CDU) that reignited debate over who should be the next conservative chancellor candidate.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel's heir apparent, had appeared to end months of leadership speculation with a 'back me or sack me' appeal to delegates at the CDU congress on Friday - which they answered by standing to applaud her.
But in the conference hall on Saturday, Soeder had other ideas.
The burly leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavarian sister party of Merkel's CDU, entered to pumping dance music, like a champion boxer, before delivering a speech full of power and punch.
Urging the CDU and CSU to show unity, he took aim at the smaller parties that have eroded support for their alliance - the 'Union' - and fractured the political landscape.
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ""doesn't want to go back to the '70s but the '30s!"" he told some 1,000 delegates gathered in Leipzig, Saxony - an eastern state where the AfD sucked away CDU votes in a regional election three months ago.
He then turned his fire on the Greens, accusing them of double standards for opposing airports and air travel but taking flights to spread their pro-environment message.
Soeder, whose state is home to BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) luxury brand Audi, said he supported electric cars. ""But the car is not the enemy in Germany. Some people think an SUV is worse than a nuclear power station!"" he said, to roars of laughter.
The speech impressed delegates, who are desperate to see a revival of the Union's fading fortunes before Merkel, 65, steps down.
The chancellor, in power since 2005, has said she will not seek office again at the next national election, due in 2021, and helped Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, to become CDU leader with an eye on next year, when the Union will decide on its chancellor candidate.
But ""AKK"" has made several gaffes since taking over as CDU leader last December that have dented her popularity and raised questions about her suitability to be the next chancellor.
Soeder, who replaced the lacklustre leader Horst Seehofer as CSU leader, may have had his mind on the same prize with his 40-minute speech, which received rapturous applause.
""He certainly belongs to the shortlist,"" said Wolfgang Reinhart, chairman of the CDU group in the Baden-Wuerttemberg regional assembly.
A more senior CDU official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Soeder was ""worth thinking about"", adding: ""He made every sentence count.""
No chancellor has ever come from the CSU, although Franz Josef Strauss and Edmund Stoiber of the CSU were the Union candidates in the 1980 and 2002 federal elections, respectively, which were both won by the Social Democrats.
""Third time lucky?"" mused one congress delegate.

(The story corrects first paragraph to make clear Merkel's protegee has been shown support, but not endorsed as chancellor candidate.)

ON BOARD THE OPEN ARMS (Reuters) - An African migrant recently rescued from a crowded dinghy drifting in the Mediterranean said he would have rather died at sea than return to Libya, highlighting the desperation driving the current wave of immigration to Europe.
Ibrahim Assoumanou Abdel Azize, originally from Togo, his Nigerian partner Fethia Owolabi and their five-year old son Ibrahim were among 73 migrants plucked out of a rubber dinghy on Wednesday night by the crew of Spain-based rescue ship, Open Arms.
The migrants, mostly from Central and West Africa, had been drifting around 50 miles off the Libyan coast for nearly 24 hours when they were picked up.
Cradling his young son in his arms, Azize smiled with relief on the ship's deck, Reuters TV footage showed.
After leaving their home in Nigeria the family arrived in Libya where they worked odd jobs for two years to try and save the $1,300 needed to pay for the crossing.
""You work for them, they don't pay the money, that's why we decided to leave Libya, we can't live our life like that with my son, I just want to keep my kid safe, that's why I left,"" said Owolabi.
UN figures show more than 1,000 migrants are believed to have drowned or gone missing while attempting to reach Europe from North Africa this year.
Azize said the crossing was worth the risk to escape Libya.
""I wanted to come to Europe, it wasn't easy while I was on the water... if I must die on the water, it is better than returning to Libya,"" he said.
Owolabi said she had been terrified and wished she had stayed in Nigeria.
""I didn't know the big sea... I was crying, I told the people 'let's go back' because I was scared.""
""I didn't know it would be like this, if I had known this I wouldn't have come, I would have gone back to my country.""
Open Arms is seeking to dock at a European port, likely in Italy or Malta, mission chief Ricardo Gati said on Thursday.
Both countries have previously refused to let the vessel land rescued migrants at its ports. A weeks-long dispute with the Italian government this summer was only resolved after a court ordered authorities to open the port, allowing 100 migrants to disembark."

Tel Abyad was one of two border towns that saw some of the heaviest fighting when Ankara launched its cross-border offensive on Oct. 9 targeting Kurdish YPG forces in northeast Syria.
The YPG -- which Ankara considers a terrorist group because of its ties to PKK Kurdish militants in southeast Turkey -- had for years been allied to the United States in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey began the incursion after President Donald Trump pulled U.S. troops out of the area.
Saturday's blast caused extensive damage to a main street in Tel Abyad, sending thick smoke into the air above the wreckage, videos posted on social media showed.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, said four civilians from the same family were among those killed by the explosion, which the local council said residents blamed on the YPG and PKK.
Turkey's Defence Ministry also accused the YPG of carrying out the attack, which it said had killed three people and wounded 20, while a senior spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accused ""Turkish-backed mercenaries"" of being responsible.
""After expelling the majority of Kurds, looting almost all the shops and houses in this Kurdish district of Tel Abyad, Turkish-backed mercenaries are now attempting to displace the remaining Kurdish population from their homes by random explosions in civilian areas,"" Mustafa Bali, the head of SDF's media office, said on Twitter.
Similar car blasts frequently hit crowded civilian areas in the mainly Arab populated towns near the border with Turkey, which are under the control of Turkish-backed forces.
The Kurdish-led forces say its fighters are engaged in a guerrilla campaign against Turkish forces but denies targeting civilians."

It did not give a reason for the decision.
The Shalamcheh crossing near the southern city of Basra was shut to travelers after a request from Iran last Saturday, a security source and an Iranian diplomat said at the time. The closure did not affect goods or trade.
Popular protests broke out in Iran last week over fuel price hikes after weeks of unrest swept Baghdad and southern Iraq demanding a chance of government. Protests in Iran have mostly subsided. In Iraq, protests continue but the level of violence has mostly decreased in recent days."

Islamic State has lost nearly all its territory in Syria and U.S. forces killed its former leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last month, but the group that once controlled a third of Syria and neighboring Iraq is still seen as a threat.
The administration of President Donald Trump shocked U.S. allies last December by saying Washington was pulling out all its troops from Syria.
It said later it decided to keep a residual force in the northeastern part of the country, focusing on preventing Islamic State from staging a comeback and attacking the oilfields there.
""Now I've got about 500 U.S. personnel generally east of the Euphrates river east of Deir al Zor up to Hasaka, northeast all the way up into extreme northeast Syria,"" McKenzie told reporters on the sidelines of the Manama Dialogue security summit in Bahrain.
""It is our intention to remain in that position working with our SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces) partners to continue operations against ISIS down the Euphrates river valley where those targets present themselves,"" he added.
Turkey launched and then halted an offensive against the YPG, the main component of the U.S.-backed SDF that helped the United States defeat Islamic State, which it sees as a terrorist group with links to Kurdish militants on Turkish soil.
Moscow, the main backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said this week it was also in the process of deploying more Russian military police to northeast Syria, setting up field hospitals for civilians, distributing humanitarian aid and rebuilding infrastructure."
1676,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>","In bid to repair ties, Japan and South Korea agree to summit next month","By Ju-min Park and Kiyoshi Takenaka
NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - Japan and South Korea agreed on Saturday to hold formal talks next month, taking a step toward improving relations strained by decades of bitterness over their wartime past and now exacerbated by a simmering trade dispute.
The decision to return to the table came a day after Seoul made a last-minute move to stick to an intelligence-sharing deal with Japan. Seoul on Saturday hailed its own move as a ""breakthrough"" after months of worsening relations.
Yet neither side gave any sign of a fundamental shift in stance, meaning that their feud will likely remain as intractable as it has been for the half century since the two U.S. allies normalized ties. 
The feud is rooted in a decades-old disagreement over compensation for South Korean laborers forced to work at Japanese firms during World War Two. Seoul has seized local assets of Japanese companies and Tokyo this year curbed exports of materials used to make semiconductors. 
""We bought time for intense discussions, but there's not much time left for us,"" South Korea's foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, told reporters.
She was speaking after meeting her Japanese counterpart, Toshimitsu Motegi, at a gathering of the Group of 20 (G20) foreign ministers in the central Japanese city of Nagoya.
Motegi had earlier said that he wanted to discuss the issue frankly.
""I aim to hold a candid exchange of views on the matter of laborers from the Korean peninsula, which is the core problem, and other bilateral issues,"" Motegi told reporters in Nagoya.
'BIG GAP'
Tokyo has been frustrated by what it calls a lack of action by Seoul after a top South Korean court ordered Japanese company Nippon Steel to compensate former forced laborers. Japan says the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the two countries restored diplomatic ties.
South Korea's Kang acknowledged that ""the gap was very big"" between the two countries over the issue of forced labor.
Japan's Motegi told Kang that bilateral ties would further worsen if Korea decided to liquidate previously seized assets of some Japanese companies, a Japanese official said. 
In her meeting with Motegi, Kang also repeatedly stressed the need for Japan to withdraw the export curbs. South Korea's chip industry is heavily reliant on specialized chemicals produced by Japan and now impacted by tighter trade restrictions.
South Korea made a last-minute decision on Friday to stick with its General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) intelligence-sharing pact with Japan. The agreement was set to expire at midnight on Friday and South Korea had earlier indicated it would let it lapse.
The decision was welcomed by Washington, which had pressured its two allies to set aside their feud and maintain the pact, seen as linchpin of trilateral security cooperation.
It was not immediately clear how much of a role Washington played in bringing the sides together.
When asked if Washington had helped push South Korea toward its last-minute reversal on the intelligence-sharing pact, a senior official at South Korea's foreign ministry told Reuters that it was a result of the three countries' close discussions, without elaborating further.

At a bilateral meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan on Saturday, South Korea's Kang asked Washington to play a ""constructive role"" in resolving issues with Japan, according to the South Korean foreign ministry.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong university campus under siege for more than a week was a deserted wasteland on Saturday, with a handful of protesters holed up in hidden refuges across the trashed grounds, as the city's focus turned to local elections. 
The siege neared its end as some protesters at Polytechnic University on the Kowloon peninsula desperately sought a way out and others vowed not to surrender, days after some of the worst violence since anti-government demonstrations escalated in June.
""If they storm in, there are a lot of places for us to hide,"" said Sam, a 21-year-old student, who was eating two-minute noodles in the cafeteria, while plotting his escape.
Another protester, Ah Chung, clad in a face mask and a red Polytechnic University track suit, said he was prepared to stay for the duration.
""I’ll continue to stay here, but hopefully not forever,"" he said with a touch of humor.
The handful of protesters still visible on the campus were outnumbered by media and people seeking to provide assistance.
A social worker who would only give his name as Sendon said he had crossed paths with four protesters on Saturday and was concerned about their mental state.
""They’ve been in this highly stressful environment for so long, over 120 hours, and they have no easy way to release this stress,"" he said. ""We’re trying to urge them to come out in a gentle manner.""
Many of the remaining protesters were in hiding, fearful of possible arrest and wary of those urging surrender, said Woo Kwok Wang, the 22-year-old acting president of the university's student union.
""They are afraid of contact with other people because they will think that maybe social workers or lawyers are going to persuade them to surrender,"" he said.
Woo said he had been on the campus since Wednesday to provide support for the students, and would only leave when he felt his help was no longer needed.
About 1,000 people have been arrested or registered by police in the siege in the Chinese-ruled city, about 300 of them younger than 18.
Police have set up high plastic barricades and a fence on the perimeter of the campus. Toward midday, officers appeared at ease, allowing citizens to mill about the edges of the cordon as neighborhood shops opened for business.
Some roads next to the campus had reopened by Saturday afternoon.
Rotting rubbish and boxes of unused petrol bombs littered the campus. On the edge of a dry fountain at its entrance lay a Pepe the frog stuffed toy, a mascot protesters have embraced as a symbol of their movement.
Scores of construction workers worked at the mouth of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, closed for more than a week after it was first blockaded, to repair toll booths smashed by protesters and clear debris from approach roads.
LOOMING ELECTION 
The repairs got underway as a record 1,104 people gear up to run for 452 district council seats in elections on Sunday.
A record 4.1 million Hong Kong people, from a population of 7.4 million, have enrolled to vote, spurred in part by registration campaigns during months of protests.
Young pro-democracy activists are now running in some of the seats that were once uncontested and dominated by pro-Beijing candidates. 
The protests snowballed from June after years of resentment over what many residents see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Beijing has said it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula by which Hong Kong is governed. It denies meddling in the affairs of the Asian financial hub and accuses foreign governments of stirring up trouble.
However, Australia's Age newspaper reported on Saturday that an apparent Chinese intelligence service agent is seeking asylum in Australia after claiming to have details on Beijing's political interference in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia. 
The defector, identified as Wang ""William"" Liqiang by Nine network newspapers, is reported to have provided the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, or ASIO, with the identities of China's senior military intelligence officers in Hong Kong, the paper said.
In an interview with Fox News Channel on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had told Chinese President Xi Jinping that crushing the Hong Kong protests would have ""a tremendous negative impact"" on efforts to end the two countries' 16-month-long trade war.
""If it weren't for me Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes,"" Trump said, without offering any evidence.

""He's got a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren't going in only because I ask him, 'Please don't do it, you'll be making a big mistake, it's going to have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal,' and he wants to make a trade deal.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Pope Francis arrived on Saturday in Japan, the second leg of a week-long Asian trip whose main aim is to bring an anti-nuclear message to Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the world's only cities to suffer atomic bombing.
Francis, 82, a determined anti-nuclear campaigner who has in the past called for a total ban on nuclear weapons, will read a message on the theme in Nagasaki on Sunday and meet survivors.
""I wish to meet those who still bear the wounds of this tragic episode in human history,"" the pope told Japanese bishops shortly after his arrival.
More than 100,000 people were killed instantly by the two bombs dropped by the United States as it sought to end World War Two in August 1945 and tens of thousands of others died in later years from radiation illnesses and injuries.
The pope will also meet survivors of the March 11, 2011 nuclear meltdown at Fukushima, the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.
The pope's plane touched down in Tokyo in a light drizzle and windy conditions. Francis flew from Thailand to start a four-day visit that will be the first by a pontiff in 38 years and only the second in history.
His trip here is filled with memories of his youth because as a seminarian in his native Argentina more than 50 years ago he dreamed of being sent to Japan as a missionary. But his superiors had other plans for him after he was ordained a priest in 1968.
After a low-key reception at the airport - the official welcome will be on Monday - he immediately went to the Vatican embassy to address the bishops.
MESSAGES FOR CHINA, HONG KONG
En route to Japan, the papal plane flew over Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese airspace and he sent messages to their respective leaders as part of customary diplomatic protocol.
The message to Carrie Lam, the embattled chief executive of Hong Kong, invoked ""well being and peace"". Francis made no mention of the months of the pro-democracy demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled special administrative region.
The message to Chinese President Xi Jinping was similar. It was the first time that Francis has flown over Chinese airspace since last year's landmark accord between Beijing and the Vatican over the appointment of bishops.
He also sent a message to Taiwan, which has diplomatic relations with the Vatican but which Beijing regards as a renegade province.
Another goal of his visit to Japan is to encourage the Catholic community in Japan, where just about 1% of the population identifies as Christian, about half of them Catholic.
He will say two Masses, one in Nagasaki and one in Tokyo, as well as meeting Japanese officials and Emperor Naruhito."

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A video celebrating the inauguration of Hungary's Puskas Stadium shows Prime Minister Viktor Orban kicking a football across town from his office balcony above the Danube right onto the pitch in the newly-built national football arena.
The $650 million, 65,000-seat venue was officially opened last week and was built to be ready for next year's continent-wide European Championship – a tournament Hungary could miss.
The government has spent more than $2 billion on football since Orban took power in 2010, with nearly $400 million in 2018 alone, according to budget data summarized by the Hungarian Football Association. That dwarfs previous spending on a sport that has failed to respond to the investment.
The International Monetary Fund put the country's economic output at about $160 billion last year – meaning one in every 400 of those dollars financed football.
Hungary has hosted the 2017 World Aquatics Championships as well as a number of other international sports events and some see Orban's efforts as part of a 'soft power' approach.
""He considers sports a breakout point, a great tool to enhance the country's image abroad,"" said Agoston Mraz, director of the Nezopont Group, a think tank close to Orban's ruling Fidesz party.
""It is connected to everything: a multiplying effect in the overall economy, tourism, media, and so on.
""It is a lot like Formula 1 and the Hungaroring (race track) was in the 1980s. Its positive effect was a lot deeper than immediately visible, which justified the billions spent on it.
""The effect of these events benefits the country in many, many ways.""
However, the investment has yet to pay dividends on the football field with the national team still struggling.
After a promising start to Euro 2020 qualification faded, Hungary must now enter the playoffs, where they travel to Bulgaria in March for a knockout match, with the winners facing Iceland or Romania for a place at the tournament.
GLORY DAYS
Long gone are Hungarian football’s glory days of global dominance in the 1950s, or even their more modest achievements in the late 1970s and '80s when they reached the World Cup.
Since then, the fortunes of the national team and Hungary's club sides have been in decline for over 30 years.
During that time, their appearance at Euro 2016, when they reached the last 16, has been Hungary’s only major tournament. Clubs have also failed to advance beyond the group stages of the Champions' League – and have reached even that phase only twice.
Orban, a decent club player and lifelong football fan, has considered it a personal mission to turn that around.
He elevated sports to front and center in his government’s priorities and has made lavish funds available for football to create a world-class infrastructure.
He even founded a football academy and a professional club in his home town Felcsut, which have received more than $130 million in state funds and private gifts according to official filings.
Peter Kreko, an analyst at the Political Capital think tank, believes it has been a mistaken approach.
""State money follows a logic of power, not one of efficiency and professionalism,"" Kreko said.
""The failure was coded into this system... The country is hostage to its leader's hobby. He can continue doing this until voters notice – and they are starting to grasp the enormity of the funds that yields them nothing but permanent frustration.""
DOZENS OF STADIUMS
Under Orban hundreds of local pitches, a dozen new arenas nationwide, and the big national stadium have been inaugurated, training facilities have been built and oaths sworn.
The Puskas, named after Ferenc Puskas who starred for Real Madrid and played for the 'Magnificent Magyars' following the Second World War, officially opened last week with a friendly against Uruguay and was a culmination of that process.
The Puskas was built on the precise location of the People’s Stadium, a drab Communist-era arena where Hungary played as they reached their peak, appearing in the 1954 World Cup final.
Club matches with 60,000 fans were not uncommon whereas today the most popular team, Ferencvaros, averages 7,600.
Demolished in 2015, the People’s Stadium concrete was recycled in the new stands and the center circle was preserved in the exact same location.
Although the stadium's hefty price tag drew heavy criticism – especially as early plans for a multi-functional arena hosting facilities for several sports were abandoned to create a football-only pitch – the government has defended it as necessary, along with all other spending on the sport.
""Football is the most popular sport in Hungary,"" said Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, on Thursday.
""We would prefer better football of course, but a lot of this money goes to non-professional sport and to youth football. If we ever want a very good national team, we have to support youth football. And let's hope for the best in the playoffs.""
Orban, speaking on Hungarian Radio on Friday, said all the country's major construction projects faced criticism before they were realized.
""We may have argued, fought, whether we need the stadium or not, but in the end, when we got it, we were all happy.
""I know the debates that surrounded these projects over the centuries. The same thing happened with the Chain Bridge, the Parliament building, theaters...
""I am never fazed by controversy during development,"" he said. ""Once you make a decision you stick by it, because once you carry it out everyone will applaud. We saw that in the last few days."""

Chiwenga, the 63-year-old former general who led a coup against the late Robert Mugabe two years ago, has spent a large part of the year away from work, also receiving treatment in South Africa and India.
His health is of great interest to Zimbabweans as he is widely seen as the driving force behind the country's President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the front-runner to succeed him. His absence from public duties had stoked speculation about the gravity of his illness, which authorities have sought to play down.
The Herald, a government-owned newspaper, showed images of Chiwenga arriving at Harare's airport in the early hours of Saturday, looking healthier than when he was last seen in public in June. He was welcomed by relatives and China's deputy ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhao Baogang, the newspaper said.
Local private media have reported that Chiwenga's health deteriorated in July and that he underwent two operations following a suspected poisoning.
Chiwenga and government officials were not available to comment on Saturday.
Government officials in Zimbabwe routinely seek medical treatment abroad while the country's public health system has collapsed and hospitals struggle to provide medicines to patients.
Many Zimbabweans are angry that top government officials continue to travel abroad for treatment while state hospitals are turning away patients because doctors have been on a pay strike since September.
The government has so far fired 435 doctors for participating in the strike."

JERUSALEM, (Reuters) - Secret recordings, powerful media moguls, illicit gifts of cigars and champagne, betrayals by trusted aides. The three corruption cases against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu have all the makings of a political thriller.
On Thursday, after more than three years of investigations, the most dominant Israeli politician of his generation was charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
Investigators have not revealed the informants who provided the first tips about alleged corruption by the veteran conservative nicknamed ""King Bibi."" But from there they methodically picked off members of the prime minister's inner circle of hand-picked aides and senior officials as state witnesses against him. The mounting evidence was revealed in a series of tantalizing leaks that undercut what prosecutors allege was Netanyahu's scheme to control his public image by trading regulatory favors to news companies for positive coverage.
The man heading the investigation was Israel’s Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who was appointed by Netanyahu in 2016 and had previously served as Bibi's cabinet secretary starting in 2013.
""I had the privilege of working with him and witnessing his many talents and capabilities as prime minister,"" Mandelblit said in announcing the charges. ""The decision to file an indictment against him was made with a heavy heart."" 
Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing from the beginning of the investigations and remained defiant in his emotional prime-time national address on the night of his indictment. He called the cases an “attempted coup” to overthrow him, based on “fabrications.” 
'ROTTEN'
The probe began with tips trickling into investigators. 
""Something smelled rotten, but it wasn't clearly criminal,"" a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation told Reuters. 
Mandelblit launched an initial inquiry in July 2016, soon after Netanyahu appointed him. Investigators soon focused on dealings between the prime minister, Israeli Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer.
These would eventually lead to Case 1000, in which Netanyahu is charged with fraud and breach of trust for allegedly requesting and receiving gifts from Packer and Milchan, which included a regular supply of cigars and champagne. 
The indictment alleges Netanyahu helped Milchan with various business interests. Milchan and Packer provided testimony and have not been charged with any wrongdoing.
During a separate probe of Netanyahu's former chief of staff, Ari Harow, investigators stumbled on a Pandora's box: secret recordings made on Harow's mobile phone.
They documented a series of meetings between two men who were then known publicly as enemies: Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, the owner of Israel's best-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth. 
""It was jaw-dropping,"" said the source, describing the moment investigators first heard the recordings.
In meetings held between 2008 and 2014, the two allegedly discussed a deal in which Mozes would provide positive coverage of Netanyahu and negative coverage of his political rivals, while Netanyahu would push for regulations on Yedioth's biggest competitor, Israel Hayom, a free daily owned by U.S. casino mogul and Netanyahu supporter, Sheldon Adelson.
The 63-page indictment released on Thursday quotes a meeting held in December 2014 during the run-up to the 2015 election. Prosecutors allege the two men discussed a bill that would have limited Israel Hayom's circulation.
""We need to make sure you are prime minister,"" Mozes allegedly told Netanyahu. ""Assuming there will be a law that you and I have agreed upon, I will do my utmost best that you stick around for as long as you want to.""
The bill the two men discussed would never become law.
The recordings shocked prosecutors as they digested them over six hours, the source told Reuters. 
""That was a big drama,"" said the source. ""It's hard to believe something like this can even happen.""
The recordings set off the investigation that led to Case 2000, which charges Netanyahu with fraud and breach of trust and Mozes with bribery.
Harow served two stints as Netanyahu’s chief of staff before resigning in 2015 amid allegations that Harow improperly advanced his own business interests while holding the position. He turned state’s witness against Netanayu in 2017 as part of a plea deal in which Harow confessed to fraud and breach of trust.
Mozes's lawyers denied wrongdoing in a written statement and called prosecutors allegations of bribery an ""erroneous and warped interpretation"" of the recordings.
'THEY WERE AFTER ME' 
The most serious case against Netanyahu, Case 4000, did not start with the prime minister. In 2017, Israel's Securities Authority (ISA) was investigating Shaul Elovitch, the chairman of the country’s biggest telecommunications firm, Bezeq Israel Telecom. ISA was investigating whether he had illegally profited from a 2015 deal in which Bezeq bought out his remaining shares in a satellite TV company. 
Netanyahu, who at the time also served as Communications Minister, was not a suspect.
One of the key figures in the probe - Shlomo Filber, director-general of the communications ministry - was picked for the government job by Netanyahu soon after he took over the communications ministry. The source said the investigation revealed a secret backchannel between Bezeq and Filbur, who in 2018 would agree to provide evidence against Netanyahu.
Investigators later found evidence pointing to the prime minister's involvement in regulatory moves that prosecutors allege provided a benefit worth about 1.8 billion Shekels ($500 million) to Bezeq. The company has denied wrongdoing. 
Bezeq controlled a popular news website called Walla. The indictment alleges that Netanyahu made the regulatory concessions in return for better coverage of him and his family. It describes a dinner in which Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, hosted Elovitch and his wife, Iris, a few weeks before Israel's 2013 election. 
""The defendants agreed that Netanyahu and his wife will be able to make demands on Mr. and Mrs. Elovitch concerning their media coverage,"" the indictment said. 
The Netanyahus allegedly made hundreds of demands over the next few years for Walla to change headlines, remove negative reports about them and increase exposure of positive ones. 
The Elovitches have been charged with bribery and obstruction of justice. Shaul Elovitch has also been charged money laundering. The couple denies any wrongdoing.
The indictment cited a striking example of Netanyahu’s influence on the news involving a rare interview he gave Walla, days before a 2015 election.
""Netanyahu was very angry about the questions,"" Dov Gilhar, the journalist who interviewed him, told Israel's public broadcaster Kan in March. After the interview, ""Netanyahu ripped the neck-mic off, threw it on the floor, says nothing, gets up, walks into his office and slams the door."" 
Gilhar told Kan that he had expected the exclusive interview to be published quickly, but two days passed before a chopped-down version ran after being edited without the journalist's involvement. 
The indictment alleges the edits were dictated by Netanyahu and Nir Hefetz, the media advisor to the prime minister's family at the time and his former official spokesman. Hefetz turned state witness in 2018. Netanyahu has been charged with bribery in this case, as well as fraud and breach of trust. 
Netanyahu said on Thursday that quid pro quo relations between politicians and the media were common, but he was being singled out.
""They weren't after the truth,"" Netanyahu said of police and prosecutors. ""They were after me."" 
Attorney General Mandelblit has rejected Netanyahu's accusations. A source close to Mandelblit described him as ""very fond of Netanyahu."" 
""But at the end of the day there's no room for sentiment,"" the source said. ""Either the evidence tells the story or it doesn't.""

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 11:23PM ET</span>",Three Colombia police killed in bombing after thousands gather for renewed protests,"By Julia Symmes Cobb and Nelson Bocanegra
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Three police were killed in a bomb blast late on Friday at a police station in Colombia, after thousands gathered for renewed protests and sporadic looting erupted in the capital Bogota.
A police source told Reuters 10 officers were also injured in the explosion, in the town of Santander (MC:SAN) de Quilichao in the southwestern province of Cauca, known as a hot spot for drug trafficking and violence. 
The source did not attribute the bombing to a particular armed group. Police are expected to hold a news conference on Saturday morning.
Three people were killed on Thursday as more than 250,000 people marched in a national strike to express growing discontent with President Ivan Duque's government. 
Their grievances included rumored economic reforms that the president has denied and anger at what protesters call a lack of government action to stop corruption and the murder of human rights activists. 
Thousands gathered on Friday afternoon in Bogota's Bolivar Plaza for a ""cacerolazo"" - a traditional Latin American expression of protest in which people bang pots and pans. 
""We are here to keep protesting against the Duque government,"" said 25-year-old art student Katheryn Martinez, as she clanged a pot with a fork accompanied by her father Arturo, 55.
""It's an inefficient government that kills children and doesn't acknowledge it,"" she said, referring to a recent bombing targeted at rebels that killed eight teenagers and prompted the former defense minister to resign.
The crowd, which included families and elderly people, was abruptly dispersed by tear gas, sending protesters running up the steep narrow streets of the historic district.
Some protesters regrouped at nearby intersections and continued chanting, while people in other neighborhoods gathered in celebratory cacerolazos, temporarily blocking some roads.
A 9 p.m. curfew is in force across Bogota, except for the neighborhoods of Bosa, Kennedy and Ciudad Bolivar, where it began at 8 p.m.
Posts on social media and callers into radio stations said neighbors were organizing to protect homes from looters, while officials urged calm.
Several supermarkets in the city's south were looted on Friday as protesters, many masked, burned items in the street and blocked roads. Other protesters stole a public bus.
Some people were taking advantage of the protests to ""sow chaos"", Duque said in a televised address on Friday evening. 
""From next week I will start a national conversation that will strengthen the current agenda of social policies,"" Duque said.
He added that dialogue would ""permit us to close social gaps, fight corruption more effectively and build, between all of us, peace with legality.""
The three deaths on Thursday in Valle del Cauca province were being investigated, Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo told journalists on Friday.
He said authorities had confirmed two deaths in Buenaventura and one in Candelaria, adding that a group of people had tried to loot the Viva Buenaventura mall.
""As a result of the confrontation between vandals and security forces and in events that are the subject of investigation by the attorney general's office, two people were killed,"" he said.
Though the vast majority of Thursday's marchers participated peacefully, 98 people were arrested, while 122 civilians and 151 members of the security forces were injured, he said.
Authorities launched 11 preliminary investigations into security forces' misconduct, Trujillo added, after social media images of protesters' rough treatment by police, including one kicked in the face.

The protests have coincided with demonstrations elsewhere in Latin America, from anti-austerity marches in Chile, to protests over vote-tampering allegations in Bolivia that led President Evo Morales to resign, and inflamed tensions in Ecuador and crisis-hit Nicaragua.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Pope Francis left Thailand on Saturday after a three-day visit and headed to Japan, where he is to visit the ground zeros of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as part of his campaign against nuclear weapons.
The pope, 82, was accompanied to the airport by his cousin, Sister Ana Rosa Sivori, a nun who has worked in Thai schools for more than 50 years and was his translator on the trip.
In Thailand, he celebrated Mass with the small Catholic minority in an overwhelmingly Buddhist country, and spoke out against human trafficking and sexual exploitation of women.
In Japan, Pope Francis is expected to turn his focus to his anti-nuclear campaign, particularly on Sunday, when he visits Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the world's only two cities to suffer nuclear attacks.
About 400,000 people were killed, either instantly or from radiation illness or injuries resulting from the atomic bombs that the United States dropped on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945 and on Nagasaki three days later, as it sought to end World War Two.
Francis will meet blast survivors, pray, and read a message on nuclear weapons at the bomb epicenter in Nagasaki. He later visits Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima.
In the Japanese capital, he will meet survivors of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. 
Francis wants a total ban on nuclear weapons, going further than his predecessors, when he said in 2017 that countries should not stockpile them, even for the purpose of deterrence.
Japan stresses its unique status as the only nation to have suffered atomic attacks and advocates disarmament, but nonetheless relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella as an extended deterrent.
Francis, who, as a young priest, wanted to be a missionary in Japan, will also meet some of a dwindling number of its ""Hidden Christians"", descendants of those who preserved their faith in secret during centuries of persecution until a ban on Christianity was lifted in 1873. 
Japan is mainly Buddhist and Shinto and only about 1% of its population of about 126 million identify as Christian. Of this number, some 536,000 are Catholic. 
Christians are disproportionately present among Japan’s elite, some of whom may have also attended Christian private schools without adopting the religion. 

Two Japanese prime ministers have been Catholics: Takashi Hara, from 1918 to 1921, and current finance minister Taro Aso, who was prime minister during 2008-2009.

BUKA, Papua New Guinea (Reuters) - Amid singing, dancing and the beat of drums, John Momis, the president of Papua New Guinea's region of Bougainville, was one of the first to cast his ballot early on Saturday in a referendum on whether to become the world's newest nation.
Voters in the island cluster at the heart of the Pacific are expected to overwhelmingly back independence, Sydney’s Lowy Institute think-tank says, at a time when Australia, China and the United States are jostling to step up regional influence.
Momis, accompanied by his wife Elizabeth and senior leaders, voted at a polling station in Bel Isi Park in the interim regional capital of Buka, while urging voters to stick to a peace process brokered between combatants two decades ago.
""Bougainville has come a long way,"" said Momis, raising his voting paper before putting it in the ballot-box. He thanked government officials in PNG and Bougainville for their resilience in arriving peacefully at the moment of the vote.
The non-binding referendum, which runs from Saturday to Dec. 7, is a key part of a peace agreement reached in the aftermath of a decade-long war between Bougainville's rebel fighters and PNG forces that took about 20,000 lives.
The fighting was triggered by disputes over the now shuttered Panguna gold and copper mine, run at the time by a forerunner of giant miner  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), set off by anger over land royalties and rivers polluted by mining.
On Saturday, people queues formed at polling stations across the South Pacific archipelago, where more than 200,000 people have registered to vote, with many people holding the region's predominantly blue flag.
""It gives this generation of Bougainvilleans a chance to achieve the dreams and aspirations of our forefathers,"" said Gerald Turumanu, from the southern village of Malabita.
The result of the referendum, which offers voters the choice of independence or more autonomy, will go before the PNG parliament in its capital, Port Moresby, and be subject to negotiation.
Ahead of the vote, chief referendum officer Mauricio Claudio said ballots from different areas would be mixed together to eliminate any risk of reprisals.
""This is to give assurance to the voters that they will not face retribution or reprisals after the polls because of how they voted,"" Claudio added.
One of the poorest areas of PNG, Bougainville boasts large deposits of gold and copper that the government wants to develop to finance its independence.
Discussion over how Bougainville would sustain its independence is likely to dominate negotiations after the referendum, two PNG ministers told Reuters earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) - The leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said on Friday he would remain neutral in any second Brexit referendum, so he could credibly carry out the result of the vote and unite the country.
Corbyn, 70, is vying to become prime minister at a Dec. 12 election called by his Conservative rival, the current Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to resolve a deadlock in parliament over the right approach to leaving the European Union.
While Johnson wants to implement a deal he has already agreed with Brussels and leave the EU in January, Labour is promising to negotiate a new exit deal and put it to the public at a second referendum next year.
""I will adopt as prime minister, if I am, at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that (referendum) to bring our communities and country together, rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU, and Brexit,"" Corbyn said during a televised question and answer session on BBC TV.
Previously, Corbyn has said his party's position would be determined by a special party conference on the issue.
Brexit divides many within Labour, with some senior figures angering eurosceptic grassroots members by saying openly they would campaign to remain in the EU.
""I don't see how you can do a deal when you say you are going to be neutral or indifferent about the deal,"" Johnson said during a later appearance on the same show.
AUDIENCE GROANS
Voters face a stark choice at the election: Corbyn's socialist vision, including widespread nationalization and free public services, or Johnson's drive to deliver Brexit within months and build a ""dynamic market economy"".
Both leaders endured criticism during their separate 30-minute grillings by members of the public in the northern city of Sheffield.
Johnson defended past comments criticized by voters as homophobic and Islamophobic, and was persistently heckled over his decision not to publish a report into Russian democratic interference. Every time he used his election slogan ""Get Brexit Done"", the audience groaned.
One participant, asking about healthcare funding, said simply: ""I think you're lying to us.""
Corbyn was criticized over his proposed economic reforms and his stance on Brexit. His most difficult moment came when addressing historic complaints about his handling of anti-Semitism complaints within Labour.
""I don't buy this whole 'nice old Grandpa' (image),"" one audience member told the veteran pacifist."

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido's call for massive street protests against President Nicolas Maduro has so far yielded only modest demonstrations, casting doubt on a plan to revive stalling efforts to force a change in government.
Last Saturday Guaido called on supporters to stage permanent street rallies against Maduro, who has clung to power despite an economic collapse and U.S. sanctions that have hobbled the OPEC member's oil exports.
There has been a low turnout at demonstrations and some protesters acknowledged being exhausted by dysfunctional public transportation, lack of power and water and crippling hyperinflation.
""The capacity for mobilization has declined and we're aware of it, this is a message for all Venezuelans that we need them,"" said Estefania Cervo, 22, a student leader at the Central University of Venezuela, at the end of a small student rally on Thursday. ""We're hoping that this will activate people.""
The rally of several hundred students ended without any clashes with security forces, despite a heavy police presence and barricades that prevented the rally from reaching the Defense Ministry as planned. [nL8N2815WX]
Rallies by teachers and nurses earlier in the week attracted small numbers and ended quickly.
Guaido in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency after declaring Maduro's 2018 re-election a fraud, winning him broad international recognition and bringing euphoric crowds to the streets.
The energy has waned since then. 
Opposition sympathizers continue to back Guaido, but many say they are disappointed that Maduro remains in power.
Guaido's popularity has dropped to 42.1 percent in November from 56.7 percent in May, according to pollster Datanalisis.
An adviser to Guaido acknowledged they were smaller than earlier in the year, but said the effort was part of a gradual strategy to build up demonstrations after a lull of several months.
""We believe that the overall balance is positive,"" said the adviser, who asked not to be identified. ""We are resuming street mobilizations that are a fundamental element of pressure against the dictatorship.""
Nationwide rallies on Nov. 16 drew modest crowds to the streets. Some participants said they were less optimistic on how the opposition would be able to push out Maduro.
While many were inspired by the resignation of Bolivian President Evo Morales after street protests, that hinged on pressure by Bolivia's armed forces for him to step aside.

Venezuela's military has stood by Maduro despite repeated calls to abandon him.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's government has launched a program to combat racism, acknowledging that a problem that Fidel Castro tried to eliminate after the 1959 leftist revolution remains unresolved.
The program aims to identify steps to fight discrimination, broaden education on Cuba's African legacy and start a public debate on racial issues, Culture Vice Minister Fernando Rojas told a cabinet meeting, according to state-run media on Friday.
""Everyone recognizes our revolution has been the social and political process that has possibly done most to eliminate racial discrimination,"" state-run media quoted President Miguel Diaz-Canel as saying.
""But there are still some vestiges that are not in our society because of policy but that are rather anchored in the culture of a group of people.""
Activists welcomed the move by Diaz-Canel, who replaced Fidel's younger brother Raul Castro as president last year, but said it remained to be seen how well the program would be implemented.
Cuba has long hailed its elimination of racial segregation as one of the revolution's greatest achievements.
Before 1959, education was largely off limits to blacks and mestizos and they were shut out of universities and jobs that involved interacting with customers. Whites had their own social clubs, beaches and private parties.
When he took power, Fidel Castro abolished segregation and gave all Cubans access to free education and health care.
But Diaz-Canel acknowledged that some Cubans still make racist jokes and some private sector businesses advertised jobs only to people of a certain skin color.
""This is a real step forwards, after we have fought for so many years,"" said Deyni Terri, a lawyer and founder of Alianza Unidad Racial (Racial Unity Alliance). ""It's a good start, particularly that the president is taking this on personally.""
Racial discrimination was also a problem in state institutions, with police more likely to arrest black citizens, Terri said.
Activist and literary researcher Roberto Zurbano said he hoped the government would listen to the proposals that had already been made.

""Welcome to the club,"" he said. ""This is an awakening"".

The nine mothers, along with three activists opposed to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, spent nine days locked in a church in the city of Masaya to demand the freedom of their children, whom they consider to be political prisoners.
On Friday, the group of protesters and a Catholic priest serving the church were transported to a hospital in the capital by a representative of the Vatican for treatment.
""Everyone is in stable health. Some are dehydrated from prolonged fasting and two are under observation for their chronic conditions,"" María Eugenia Espinoza, a doctor who serves as director of Vivian Pellas Hospital, told reporters.
Father Edwin Román, the priest who joined the mothers, has complained on social media that after the group began their protest, the police cut off power and water in the church and prevented locals from assisting them.
Nicaragua's churches have been transformed into political battlegrounds in recent weeks amid protests that have been raging for more than a year and a half.
Both the Organization of American States and the United Nations raised alarms this week about human rights in Central America's largest country, as protests have intensified.

On Monday, Nicaraguan police arrested 16 anti-government protesters, accusing them of planning to carry out terrorist attacks. Some of their families say they were arrested after bringing water to the mothers in Masaya.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - China's new ambassador to Canada on Friday warned Ottawa not to follow the U.S. lead and formally back protesters in Hong Kong, saying such a move would cause ""very bad damage"" to already poor ties with Beijing.
Canada, locked in a trade and diplomatic dispute with China, has repeatedly expressed concern about the safety of its 300,000 citizens in Hong Kong, hit by five months of mass demonstrations for more democracy and autonomy.
The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed two bills to back the protesters and send a warning to China about human rights.
""If somebody here really tries to ... have this kind of law like that in the United States, it's very dangerous,"" said Chinese envoy Cong Peiwu, speaking in English.
""If anything happens like this it will certainly have a very bad damage on our bilateral relationship and that is not in the interests of Canada,"" he told a news conference in the embassy. He formally presented his credentials on Nov 1.
The uncompromising tone of his message indicated that while the ambassador may have changed, China's approach has not.
Cong repeated Beijing's demand that Canada immediately release Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who is out on bail after Canadian police detained her on a U.S. arrest warrant last December. 
""This incident has led to the severe difficulties the two countries are facing nowadays,"" said Cong.
Shortly after Meng's arrest, China picked up two Canadian citizens on state secret charges, and has since blocked imports of canola seed from Canada.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, asked on Wednesday what additional measures Canada would take to protect its citizens in Hong Kong, said, ""We will continue to call for de-escalation and an end to violence"" while urging dialogue.
If Canada wanted to protect its citizens, it should ask ""those rioters to stop the violence, otherwise those Canadians living in Hong Kong, how can they be safe?"" Cong said.
In a move that could further irritate China, two prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists will accept an award on Saturday at a major Canadian gathering that is partly funded by the federal government.

Figo Chan and Emily Lau are due to accept the John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service on behalf of the people of Hong Kong. It will be presented to them at the Halifax International Security Forum in Atlantic Canada.

(Reuters) - U.S. Army cadets were this week instructed not to use China-owned social media app TikTok while representing the military, an Army spokeswoman said on Friday, amid concerns over the app's handling of user data.
The directive comes after Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate, urged the Army to review potential risks in its use of the popular video app for recruiting American teenagers.
On Thursday, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said the Army was undertaking a security assessment of the app, which is owned by tech giant Beijing ByteDance Technology Co.
The U.S. Army Cadet Command, which issued the order, oversees the Reserve Officers Training Corp, ROTC, and Junior ROTC, to train university and high school students for the military. The guidance from cadet command was issued in order to ""err on the side of caution"", an Army spokeswoman said.
While cadets can still use the app for their own personal use, the guidance would prohibit them posting TikToks for recruitment, while in uniform or performing official duties. The directive was first reported by online military-focused publication Task & Purpose.
A Reuters search of the hashtags ""#rotc"" and ""#jrotc"" found multiple TikToks of young men and women in U.S. military uniforms lip-syncing, dancing and performing training exercises.
TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company has previously stressed its independence from Beijing and said no U.S. user data is stored in China, but it has failed to assuage congressional concerns about the security of the personal data of U.S. citizens using the app and whether content on the platform is subject to censorship from Beijing.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has launched a national security review of ByteDance's $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly.
An Army spokeswoman said the Army has not given any other specific guidance on the use of TikTok, but that it does have formal social media guidance that applies to the use of all current and emerging social media platforms.
""We also continuously remind soldiers to remain vigilant about the risks of using any social media platform when sharing their personal information and data,"" she said."

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's attorney general said on Friday that his office has opened a probe into former President Evo Morales for alleged sedition and terrorism, related to accusations from the interim government that he has been stirring unrest since resigning.
The interior minister earlier filed a criminal complaint against the former socialist leader, based on evidence Morales described as fake. 
Interim President Jeanine Anez, a former senator and opponent of Morales, has faced a wave of demonstrations by his supporters since taking office in a power vacuum last week.
Morales and his vice president stepped down under pressure from security forces and anti-government protesters on Nov. 10, amid reports of irregularities in an Oct. 20 election. 
Morales fled to Mexico, which has granted him asylum, and says he was toppled in a coup. At least 29 have been killed in clashes with security forces since he resigned.
Attorney General Juan Lanchipa said the foreign ministry would ask Mexico to allow Morales to provide his statement as a suspect in the investigation, which is based on a video Interior Minister Arturo Murillo distributed to media this week. In the video, a Bolivian man is shown talking to someone on a speakerphone who appears to be directing plans for road blockades.
Murillo said the voice on the speakerphone was that of Morales. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the video. 
Murillo told journalists outside the prosecutors' office in La Paz on Friday: ""The evidence is clear. We've presented it."" 
Morales could not immediately be reached for comment. He said on Twitter that authorities should be investigating the deaths of protesters instead of going after him on the basis of what he called made-up evidence. 
Blocking roads is a common form of protest in Bolivia and much of South America. Intense blockades by Morales supporters have cut off fuel and food to some cities.
Authorities have transported some 1,400 tonnes of food by plane in less than a week due to blockades, the government said on Friday.
LEGISLATION FOR NEW ELECTIONS 
The criminal probe into Morales did not appear to slow efforts by lawmakers in his Movement to Socialism (MAS) party from working with their opponents in Congress to pass legislation to pave the way for new elections.
MAS congressman Henry Cabrera, the vice president of the house of deputies, said parliament planned to pass a bill by Saturday afternoon, after a deal was reached among all parties on Friday. 
""We're definitely going to approve it,"" Cabrera told Reuters. ""We're not going to obstruct anything.""
But on the streets Morales' supporters have continued to push for Anez to resign. 
On Friday, she made a public plea for demonstrators to end an ongoing blockade at a natural gas plant that supplies La Paz. 
Eight people died in clashes after the military forcibly cleared access to the plant briefly on Tuesday. Protesters carrying the coffins with some of the dead were dispersed with tear gas on Thursday as they neared the presidential palace. 
""I ask for reflection from brothers who are carrying out this unnecessary blockade,"" Anez said on Friday. ""We're all Bolivians.""
Anez reiterated she will only stay in power long enough for new elections. But her critics say her cabinet has overstepped the bounds of a caretaker government by making changes to foreign policy, opening Morales' former living quarters for journalists to tour, and threatening to punish his allies.
In the past week, authorities have alleged that several of Morales' allies have taken part in criminal activity, including the former culture minister, his former presidency minister, the former vice president's brother, and the vice president of MAS.

A lawyer affiliated with opponents of Morales, Jorge Valda, said he planned to also ask authorities to issue an arrest warrant for Morales' daughter, Evaliz Morales, for alleged sedition and corruption. She could not be reached for comment.

1694,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 05:42PM ET</span>",Ex-CIA officer sentenced to 19 years in prison for conspiring to spy for China,"By Sarah N. Lynch
(Reuters) - A former CIA case officer was sentenced by a federal judge in Virginia on Friday to serve 19 years in prison, after he pleaded guilty in May to conspiring to become a spy for China, federal prosecutors announced.
Jerry Chuan Shing Lee, 55, left the CIA in 2007 and moved to Hong Kong. A few years later, in 2010, he was approached by two Chinese intelligence officers who offered to pay him $100,000 and to take care of him “for life” for information he had acquired as a CIA officer.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars were subsequently paid into Lee’s personal bank account between 2010 and 2013, in exchange for his services.
""Instead of embracing that responsibility and honoring his commitment to not disclose national defense information, Lee sold out his country, conspired to become a spy for a foreign government, and then repeatedly lied to investigators about his conduct,"" Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement.
According to the Justice Department, the FBI conducted a search of Lee's hotel room in Hawaii in August 2012 and discovered he had an address book and day planner containing handwritten notes he had made during his time as a CIA case officer prior to 2004. 
The notes included highly sensitive intelligence, such as the names of CIA assets, operational meeting locations, phone numbers and details on covert facilities.
He later lied to the FBI when he was confronted.
He pleaded guilty in May with conspiring to deliver national security defense information to aid a foreign government.
Lee is one of three former U.S. intelligence officers to receive a lengthy prison sentence in recent months on charges relating to Chinese espionage.
In May, another former CIA case officer, Kevin Mallory, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after being convicted on charges of conspiring to transmit U.S. defense secrets to China.
In September, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency officer, Ron Rockwell Hansen, was sentenced to 10 years for attempting to transmit classified information to China and receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars while acting as an agent for Beijing.

DENVER (Reuters) - An avowed white supremacist being held without bond for plotting to bomb a Colorado synagogue this month has been indicted on additional charges of attempted arson and using explosives to commit a felony, federal prosecutors said on Friday.
The two additional charges against Richard Holzer, 27, on top of an earlier count of attempting to obstruct religious services by force, could send him to prison for 50 years, U.S. Attorney Jason Dunn said in a statement.
Holzer was arrested on Nov. 4 after an undercover sting by FBI agents, who said he plotted to bomb the Temple Emanuel synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado. The temple, built in 1900, is the second oldest synagogue in the state and is on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Colorado Federal Public Defender's Office, which represents Holzer, declined to comment.
Hate crimes in the United States jumped by 17 percent and anti-Jewish attacks spiked 37 percent in 2017, the most recent year for which statistics are available, according to the FBI.
Holzer's arrest came just over a year after the worst attack on a Jewish community in U.S. history when a lone gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Oct. 27, 2018, killing 11 people.
According to an arrest warrant affidavit, FBI agents tracked Holzer's social media accounts in which he allegedly professed a hatred of Jews, and exchanged ""white supremacy ideology ... including racially-motivated acts of violence"" with like-minded individuals.
""I wish the Holocaust really did happen ... they need to die,"" Holzer said in one posting, the affidavit said.
Posing as fellow white supremacists, the undercover agents then contacted Holzer via a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) message and he sent them photos of a swastika and pictures of himself wearing clothing with white supremacy symbols and phrases, the FBI said.
Agents later met with Holzer, who lived in Pueblo, and he broached the idea of bombing the synagogue, the affidavit said. The FBI provided him with inert pipe bombs and dynamite to see if he was serious about carrying out the plot.
Following his arrest, Holzer waived his right to remain silent and told investigators he wanted to bomb the temple because it was ""a cancer"" in Pueblo, a city of 112,000 about 100 miles south of Denver.
Holzer is set to appear before a federal magistrate judge on Monday to be advised of the new charges."
1696,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 04:35PM ET</span>",Protesters left on besieged Hong Kong campus weigh options,"By Kate Lamb and Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - At least eight protesters who had been holding out at a trashed Hong Kong university surrendered on Friday, while others searched for escape routes past the riot police surrounding the campus.
The siege at the Polytechnic University on the Kowloon peninsula appeared to be nearing an end with the number of protesters dwindling to a handful, days after some of the worst violence since anti-government demonstrations escalated in June.
Police chief Chris Tang, who took up the post this week, urged those remaining inside to come out.
""I believe people inside the campus do not want their parents, friends ... to worry about them,"" Tang told reporters.
Those who remain say they want to avoid being arrested for rioting or on other charges, so hope to find some way to slip past the police or hide.
Sitting in the largely deserted campus, one holdout described how his girlfriend had pleaded with him to surrender to the police.
He had refused, he said, telling her she might as well find another partner because he would likely go to jail.
""A man has to abandon everything otherwise it's impossible to take part in a revolution,"" the protester told Reuters.
The U.S. Congress has passed legislation to back the Hong Kong protesters and threaten China with possible sanctions for human rights violations, angering Beijing. President Donald Trump, who is seeking a resolution to a tit-for-tat tariff trade war with Beijing, was vague on Friday when asked whether he would sign the bills.
Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel that he told Chinese President Xi Jinping that crushing the protesters would have ""a tremendous negative impact"" on efforts to end the 16-month trade war.
""If it weren't for me Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes,"" he said, without offering any evidence.
""He's got a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren't going in only because I ask him please don't do it, you'll be making a big mistake, it's going to have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal and he wants to make a trade deal."" 
CAMPUS QUIET 
The Polytechnic campus was so quiet on Friday you could hear the chants of Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers exercising on their nearby base.
Many levels of the buildings look like abandoned hideouts strewn with remains — rucksacks, masks, water bottles, cigarette butts, with security cameras smashed throughout. Lockers were stuffed with gas masks and black clothes, and a samurai sword lay on the ground where it was abandoned.
""We are feeling a little tired. All of us feel tired but we will not give up trying to get out,"" said a 23-year-old demonstrator who gave his name as Shiba as he ate noodles in the protesters' canteen. 
A Reuters reporter saw six black-clad protesters holding hands walk toward police lines, while a first aid worker said two more surrendered later.
The protests snowballed from June after years of resentment over what many residents see as Chinese meddling in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Protesters, who have thrown petrol bombs and rocks and fired bows and arrows at police, are calling for full democracy and an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality, among other demands.
Police have responded to the attacks with rubber bullets, tear gas, water cannon and occasional live rounds but say they have acted with restraint in life-threatening situations.
On Friday Hong Kong's High Court said it would temporarily suspend its ruling that found a controversial law banning protesters from wearing face masks is unconstitutional.
The court said it would suspend its ruling for seven days while appeals processes proceeded. 
Beijing has said it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula under which Hong Kong is governed. It denies meddling in its affairs and accuses foreign governments of stirring up trouble.
One older protester, who estimated only about 30 demonstrators remained at the university, said some had given up looking for escape routes and were making new weapons to protect themselves in case police stormed the campus.
There have been two days and nights of relative calm in the city ahead of district council elections that are due to take place on Sunday. 

Tang said police would adopt a ""high-profile"" presence on Sunday and he appealed to protesters to refrain from violence so people feel safe to vote.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>","New hearing, same sentence for convicted Penn State child molester Jerry Sandusky","By David DeKok
BELLEFONTE, Pa. (Reuters) - A resentencing hearing on Friday for former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky resulted in the same penalty that he received after his 2012 conviction for sexually assaulting teenage boys: 30 to 60 years in prison, likely the rest of his life. 
Sandusky was granted the hearing because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that minimum sentencing requirements, such as those on which his original sentence was based, were unconstitutional.
Sporting a faded orange prison jumpsuit, Sandusky smiled broadly to spectators, including his wife Dottie, as he entered the courtroom at the Centre County Court of Common Pleas in Bellefonte, where his trial was held seven years ago. 
His shoulders slumped when he heard Visiting Judge Maureen Skerda reimpose the 30-to-60-year sentence on him. 
“I know you maintain your innocence,” Skerda told Sandusky. ""But you have been found guilty by a jury of your peers, and the court must hold you accountable.” 
The hearing, ordered in February by Pennsylvania Superior Court, took place just 10 miles (16 kms) from Pennsylvania State University, where Sandusky served as an assistant to longtime head coach Joe Paterno.
In June 2012, Sandusky was convicted of 25 felonies and 20 misdemeanors stemming from charges that he molested 10 boys between 1994 and 2009.
A statement by one of boys, identified as Victim 5, was read aloud in court by Pennsylvania Victim Advocate Jennifer Storm.
""I was 13 and Jerry Sandusky lured me into the Penn State shower and made me touch him,"" the statement said. ""Horseplay, he called it. But it was sexual assault.” 
Sandusky, who will not be eligible for parole until he turns 98 years old, has sought without success to have his conviction overturned. 
“We will continue fighting,” his lawyer, Al Lindsay, told reporters after the brief hearing. “And I think we’ll be successful.”
The same court that ordered his resentencing in February rejected Sandusky's request for a new trial based on his claim that he had ineffective legal counsel, a decision the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to review.
Sandusky's appellate lawyer, Peter Goldberger, last month sought to petition a federal court to vacate his conviction, but was told he could not do so until he is resentenced. 

Sandusky, who founded the now-defunct Second Mile charity for at-risk youth, has been held at the state's Laurel Highlands correctional facility in Somerset.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>",Argentine health chief quits in abortion fight with conservative president,"By Marina Lammertyn
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's health secretary resigned on Friday after a protocol he signed the day before, aimed at making abortion more available, was revoked by conservative President Mauricio Macri, less than a month before he is to leave office.
""Unfortunately, the repeal of the protocol forces me to resign my position as the nation's secretary of health,"" Adolfo Rubinstein said in his resignation letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
The proposed nationwide protocol would have widened the criteria under which abortion is allowed. Currently, the procedure is only legal in cases of rape or threat to the life or health of the mother, although local authorities have latitude in deciding which cases fall under the criteria.
The proposed new protocol would have considered all pregnant girls 13-years-old or younger to have been raped, hence eligible for abortion. All girls 15 and under would have been eligible for abortions due to ""physical and psychological risks.""
Conservative Macri shot down the wider criteria, saying that Rubinstein acted beyond his authority.
""This was a unilateral decision by the secretary, and that is wrong,"" Mauricio Macri said on Instagram about the issuance of the updated protocol.
Abortion is a highly contested issue in Argentina. There are at least 350,000 illegal abortions in the country every year, the Ministry of Health estimates, though international human rights groups say the number may be higher.
President-elect Alberto Fernandez, set to take office on Dec. 10, has said he favors abortion rights and vows to send a bill to Congress once he is in power. Proposals to widen the availability of abortion have been batted back and forth between the lower house and Senate for years."
1699,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 03:53PM ET</span>",U.S. imposes sanctions on Iran's information minister,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on Iran's information minister on Friday for his role in ""widescale internet censorship,"" a reference to a five-day-long nationwide shutdown meant to help stifle protests against fuel price hikes in Iran.
The internet blockage, which Iran said on Thursday it had begun to roll back, made it difficult for protesters to post videos on social media to generate support and also to obtain reliable reports on the extent of the unrest.
Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, the Iranian minister, has advanced Tehran's policy of ""repressive internet censorship"" while in office, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, which described him as a former intelligence official who has been involved in surveillance against opposition activists. 
""Iran’s leaders know that a free and open internet exposes their illegitimacy, so they seek to censor internet access to quell anti-regime protests,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
""We are sanctioning Iran's Minister of Information and Communications Technology for restricting internet access, including to popular messaging applications that help tens of millions of Iranians stay connected to each other and the outside world,"" he added. 
The sanctions block any Azari-Jahromi property under U.S. jurisdiction, the Treasury Department said in a statement, saying its regulations generally bar dealings by U.S. persons, or those transiting the United States, in such property.
""I'm not the only member of club of sanctioned persons (Based on Trump's fairytales). Before me, Iran ICT startups, Developers, Cancer patients and EB children were there. I'll continue advocating access to Internet & I won't let US to prohibit Iran development.#EconomicTerrorism,"" Azari-Jahromi tweeted after the announcement.
On Thursday, Iranian media said the country’s National Security Council, which had ordered the shutdown, approved reactivating the internet gradually in some areas. Azari-Jahromi has pointed out in local media interviews that the shutdown was implemented by the council, possibly to avoid public criticism, but has said it was important for security reasons.
The youngest minister in Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s cabinet, Azari-Jahromi reportedly has presidential ambitions, according to Iran analysts.
""We will hold members of the Iranian regime accountable for their violent repression of the Iranian people,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote in a tweet.
Demonstrations have spread across Iran since last week after the government announced gasoline price hikes of at least 50% and quickly turned political, with protesters demanding that top officials step down.
Tehran has blamed ""thugs"" linked to exiles and foreign foes - the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia - for the unrest.
The protests in Iran come as the Iranian economy has been crippled by U.S. sanctions reimposed since President Donald Trump withdrew from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.
